        "explanation": "Statement I is incorrect.  The atmosphere is heated *primarily* by terrestrial radiation (infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface). While the Earth's surface is initially heated by incoming solar radiation, it's the subsequent re-radiation of this energy as infrared radiation that significantly warms the atmosphere.\n\nStatement II is correct. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor are effective at absorbing longwave (infrared) radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. This absorption traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that **Statement II is correct and Statement I is incorrect.**\n"

        "explanation": "Statement-I is correct. The troposphere is thicker at the equator than at the poles.  This is because the equator receives more solar radiation, leading to warmer temperatures and stronger convection currents.  Warm air rises, creating a thicker layer of troposphere.\n\nStatement-II is also correct. Strong convective currents are driven by intense solar heating at the equator.  This warm air rises, carrying heat to higher altitudes within the troposphere.\n\nTherefore, both statements are correct, and Statement-II provides a reason for Statement-I.\n"

        "subject": "geography",
        "year": 2024,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is **1 only**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Statement 1 is correct:**  In January, land cools down faster than the ocean.  This creates a temperature difference.  Isotherms (lines of equal temperature) will bend toward the warmer area (ocean) over land and toward the colder area (land) over the ocean.  This results in a northward deflection over the ocean and a southward deflection over the continents.\n\n* **Statement 2 is incorrect:** The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift are *warm* currents.  Their presence would actually make the North Atlantic Ocean *warmer* than it otherwise would be, causing isotherms to bend southward (towards the warmer water).  Cold currents would cause a northward bend.  The statement incorrectly associates these warm currents with colder temperatures and a northward bend.\n\nTherefore, only inference 1 is a valid conclusion based on typical January isothermal maps.\n"

The impact of raindrops itself can cause physical weathering, and the chemical composition of rainwater contributes to chemical weathering.\n\n* **Statement II:** Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming a weak carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083). This acid reacts with rocks, especially carbonate rocks like limestone, causing chemical weathering.\n\n* **Statement III:** Rainwater also dissolves atmospheric oxygen.

Lions do have a breeding season, although it's not as strictly defined as some other animals.  Their breeding is more opportunistic, but it's not year-round.\n\n2. **Unlike most other big cats, cheetahs do not roar.** This is **correct**. Cheetahs are unique among big cats in their inability to roar.

Reactors sustain a controlled chain reaction; RTGs rely on the spontaneous decay of a radioisotope.  There's no chain reaction involved.\n\n2. **RTGs are used for powering the onboard systems of spacecrafts.** This is correct.  RTGs are a reliable power source for spacecraft far from the Sun where solar power is insufficient.\n\n3. **RTGs can use Plutonium-238, which is a by-product of weapons development.** This is largely correct.  While Plutonium-238 isn't *directly* a by-product in the sense of being a leftover waste material, it's produced through similar nuclear processes used in weapons production.

The system was often quite inflexible and harsh on peasants.\n\n**Statement 2:** While it's true that under the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, Zamindars faced consequences for non-payment of revenue,  the statement oversimplifies the process.

However, the Speaker is not allowed to vote on the resolution itself in the initial instance.  This is to ensure impartiality during the process of their potential removal.  They can, however, vote if there is a tie.\n"

        "question text": "With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements: 1. Prorogation of a House by the President of India does not require the advice of the Council of Ministers. 2. Prorogation of a House is generally done after the House is adjourned sine die but there is no bar to the President of India prorogating the House which is in session. 3. Dissolution of the Lok Sabha is done by the President of India who, save in exceptional circumstances, does so on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",
        "option a": "1 only",
        "option b": "1 and 2",
        "option c": "2 and 3",
        "option d": "3 only",
        "subject": "polity",
        "year": 2024,
        "explanation": "The correct statements are 2 and 3. Let's break down why:\n\n* **Statement 1 is incorrect:** Prorogation of a House by the President of India *does* require the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The President acts on the advice of the government.\n\n* **Statement 2 is correct:**  A House can be prorogued even while it's in session.  While it's typically done after adjournment sine die (indefinite adjournment), there's no constitutional requirement preventing it from happening otherwise.\n\n* **Statement 3 is correct:** The President dissolves the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). While the President has nominal power, in practice, this is almost always done on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The exception would be in highly unusual constitutional crises.\n\n\nTherefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2, 3}$"

        "question text": "With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements: 1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses on its dissolution. 2. A bill passed by the Lok Sabha and pending in the Rajya Sabha lapses on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. 3. A bill in regard to which the President of India notified his/her intention to summon the Houses to a joint sitting lapses on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",
        "option a": "1 only",
        "option b": "1 and 2",
        "option c": "2 and 3",
        "option d": "3 only KSPC-P-GSPO (41-A)",
        "subject": "polity",
        "year": 2024,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is **1 and 2**.\n\nLet's examine each statement:\n\n1. **A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses on its dissolution.** This is **correct**.  When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all pending bills in that house automatically lapse.  They must be reintroduced in the new Lok Sabha if they are to be considered again.\n\n2. **A bill passed by the Lok Sabha and pending in the Rajya Sabha lapses on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.** This is also **correct**. Even if a bill has cleared the Lok Sabha, if the Lok Sabha is dissolved before the Rajya Sabha passes it, the bill lapses.  It needs to go through the entire legislative process again in the newly constituted Lok Sabha.\n\n3. **A bill in regard to which the President of India notified his/her intention to summon the Houses to a joint sitting lapses on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.** This is **incorrect**.  The President's notification to convene a joint sitting is an indication of the government's intention to pass the bill.  While the dissolution of the Lok Sabha would necessitate restarting the legislative process in a new Lok Sabha, the notification for a joint sitting doesn't automatically make the bill void. The bill would need to be reintroduced and go through the process again.  The President's intention to summon a joint sitting is separate from the Lok Sabha's dissolution.  The possibility of a joint sitting remains even with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, but the process needs to be restarted.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.\n"

PM-SYM is designed for the unorganized sector and the entry age is indeed between 21 and 40 years.\n\n2. **Age-specific contribution shall be made by the beneficiary.** This is also correct.
