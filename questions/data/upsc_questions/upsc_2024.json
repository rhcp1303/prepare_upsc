        "year": 2024,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (b)\nexplanation:Statement-I is incorrect. The atmosphere is heated more by terrestrial radiation (infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface) than by incoming solar radiation (shortwave radiation).  While the sun provides the initial energy, the Earth's surface absorbs this energy and re-radiates it as heat in the form of infrared radiation. This infrared radiation is then absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to atmospheric warming.  Statement-II is correct.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (like methane, nitrous oxide, etc.) are effective at absorbing longwave (infrared) radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. This absorption traps heat within the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.  Therefore, both statements are true, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I.\n\nGreenhouse gases:  These are gases in the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat.  The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor.  They absorb infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space and causing a warming effect.\n\nIncoming solar radiation: This refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun that reaches the Earth's atmosphere.  A portion of this radiation is reflected back into space, while the rest is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere.\n\nTerrestrial radiation:  This is the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface after absorbing solar radiation.  It is a major driver of atmospheric warming due to its absorption by greenhouse gases.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\nexplanation:Statement-I is correct. The thickness of the troposphere varies with latitude, being greatest at the equator and least at the poles.  This is because the equator receives more solar radiation, leading to stronger heating and greater atmospheric expansion. Statement-II is also correct and directly explains Statement-I.  Stronger convection currents at the equator transport heat upwards, contributing to the greater thickness of the troposphere in that region.  The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, characterized by decreasing temperature with altitude.  Convectional currents are upward movements of air caused by heating.\n"

Ash can cause significant disruption to air travel and damage infrastructure.\n\nNitrogen compounds: Volcanic eruptions release various nitrogen-containing gases, such as ammonia and nitrogen oxides.

        "year": 2024,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\nexplanation:In January, isotherms (lines connecting points of equal temperature) generally deviate northward over oceans and southward over continents. This is because water has a higher specific heat capacity than land, meaning it takes longer to heat up and cool down.  Therefore, ocean temperatures remain relatively warmer in January than land temperatures, causing the isotherms to bend northward over the oceans. Conversely, land cools down more quickly, resulting in southward bending of isotherms over continents.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While cold ocean currents like the Labrador Current do influence the temperature of the North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift are warm currents that actually *increase* temperatures in the North Atlantic, causing isotherms to bend towards the south, not the north.\n"

Carabid beetles encompass a large group with diverse feeding habits; some are parasitoids. Therefore, parasitoid species are found in at least three of the listed organisms (flies, wasps, and some carabid beetles), making option (c) the most accurate answer.

It seeks to accelerate the shift towards net-zero carbon and nature-positive food and water systems.\n\n* **Net-zero (carbon):** A state where greenhouse gas emissions are balanced by removals, resulting in no net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Achieving net-zero is a key goal in mitigating climate change.\n\n* **Nature-positive:**  A state where the natural environment is actively improved and restored, going beyond simply preventing further degradation.  This often involves enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\n* **Farmer resilience:** The ability of farmers to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, such as climate change, economic downturns, or pest outbreaks.  It involves adaptive capacity and robust livelihoods.\n\n* **Organic animal husbandry:**  The practice of raising livestock without the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or growth hormones.

Tathagata (\"Thus Gone One\" or \"He who has thus gone\") is a title reflecting his attainment of enlightenment and his path to liberation.  While Nayaputta (\"Son of the family\") is sometimes associated with him, it's not as widely recognized an epithet as Shakyamuni and Tathagata. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are consistently used as epithets of Gautama Buddha.\n\n**Short notes:**\n\n* **Gautama Buddha:**  Siddhartha Gautama, born into the Shakya clan in Lumbini (present-day Nepal) around 563 BCE, is the founder of Buddhism.  He renounced his princely life to seek enlightenment, achieving it at the age of 35. His teachings focus on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, aiming to overcome suffering through understanding and practice. He died around 483 BCE in Kusinara (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India).\n\n* **Shakyamuni:**  This epithet literally translates to \"Sage of the Shakya clan,\" directly referencing Buddha's lineage and highlighting his wisdom and spiritual attainment.  It emphasizes his origins and the context from which his teachings emerged.\n\n* **Tathagata:**  This title is more abstract and emphasizes the Buddha's unique spiritual state and the path he traversed.  It suggests a state of being beyond ordinary human experience, signifying the culmination of his spiritual journey and the realization of enlightenment.\n\n* **Nayaputta:** While sometimes associated with Buddha, this epithet (\"Son of the family\") is less commonly used as a primary title compared to Shakyamuni and Tathagata. It's a more general term indicating familial origin.\n"

The Rajya Sabha's approval is required for most bills to become law.  Since the bill hasn't completed its legislative journey, dissolution of the Lok Sabha nullifies the progress made.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  If the President has notified the intention to summon a joint sitting of both houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) to resolve a deadlock over a bill, the dissolution of the Lok Sabha does not cause the bill to lapse.  The joint sitting is a mechanism to resolve disagreements between the two houses.  Dissolution of one house doesn't negate the President's call for a joint sitting.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Named Entities:**\n\n* **Lok Sabha:** The lower house of the Indian Parliament, directly elected by the people. It is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.  Its members are elected for a term of five years.\n\n* **Rajya Sabha:** The upper house of the Indian Parliament, representing the states. Members are elected indirectly by state legislatures, with a staggered six-year term.  It has less power than the Lok Sabha, but its approval is necessary for most bills.\n\n* **President of India:** The head of state of India, holding largely ceremonial powers,  but plays a significant role in legislation through assenting to bills passed by Parliament.\n\n\n"
