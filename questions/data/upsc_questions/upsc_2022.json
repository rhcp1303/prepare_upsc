        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\n\nexplanation:\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee, not appreciation. NEER measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, weighted by their relative importance in trade.  An increase signifies that the rupee has become cheaper relative to the basket.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a *decrease* in trade competitiveness. REER adjusts NEER for inflation differences between countries.  An increase means the country's goods and services are relatively more expensive compared to its trading partners, making them less competitive.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  If domestic inflation rises faster than inflation in other countries, the REER will increase more than the NEER. This is because REER accounts for inflation, while NEER does not.  The divergence reflects the impact of differing inflation rates on relative price competitiveness.\n\n\nShort notes on keywords and named entities:\n\n* **Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):** A weighted average of a country's currency against a basket of other currencies. It shows the overall value of the currency relative to its trading partners, without considering inflation.\n\n* **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):**  Similar to NEER but adjusted for inflation differences between the country and its trading partners. It provides a more accurate measure of a country's competitiveness in international trade.\n\n* **Domestic Inflation:** The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising within a country.\n\n"

Statement 1 is correct: By indexing the coupon payments to inflation, the government can reduce the nominal coupon rate it offers on its borrowings, as the real return is protected. Statement 2 is also correct: IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk; their returns adjust with changes in the price level, preserving the real value of their investment. Statement 3 is incorrect:  Interest earned and capital gains on IIBs are generally taxable, unlike some other investment instruments. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nInflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs):  These are bonds where the principal and/or interest payments are adjusted periodically based on a measure of inflation (like the Consumer Price Index or Wholesale Price Index). This protects investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): A measure that tracks changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services. It's used to calculate inflation.\n\nWholesale Price Index (WPI): A measure that tracks changes in the price level of goods traded in bulk at the wholesale level.

        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (b)\n* **explanation:** Rice cultivation is a significant anthropogenic source of both methane (CH\u2084) and nitrous oxide (N\u2082O).  Flooded paddy fields create anaerobic conditions ideal for methanogenic archaea to produce methane.  The use of nitrogen fertilizers in rice production leads to the release of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.  While other crops may contribute to these gases, rice cultivation's unique water management practices make it the most important anthropogenic source among the options provided.\n\nCotton is a significant crop but its greenhouse gas emissions are primarily related to the energy-intensive processes of its production and processing rather than direct emissions from the plant itself.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) involves alternate wetting and drying of rice paddies. This practice leads to several benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced seed requirement:** SRI uses fewer seeds per hectare compared to traditional methods because seedlings are transplanted at a younger age and with greater spacing.  This results in better aeration and nutrient uptake for individual plants, leading to higher yields despite lower plant density.\n\n\n2. **Reduced methane production:**  Flooded rice paddies are a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  The alternate wetting and drying in SRI reduces the anaerobic conditions in the soil, thus decreasing methane emissions.  The reduced waterlogging minimizes the activity of methanogenic archaea responsible for methane production.\n\n\n3. **Reduced electricity consumption:** SRI's water management strategy decreases the need for frequent irrigation, especially with pump-based irrigation systems. This results in less electricity consumption for pumping water.  The improved water use efficiency also contributes to this reduction.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are correct.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\n\nexplanation:\n\nStatement 1: A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (the central bank of the US) typically involves raising interest rates.  Higher US interest rates make US assets more attractive to foreign investors, leading to capital outflow from other countries, including a potential capital flight from those countries.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.\n\nStatement 2: Capital flight increases the demand for the US dollar.  This strengthens the dollar, making it more expensive for firms in other countries to repay their External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), which are loans denominated in foreign currencies (often US dollars). The higher exchange rate increases the cost of repayment in the domestic currency. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.\n\nStatement 3: Devaluation of the domestic currency makes the domestic currency weaker relative to the foreign currency in which the ECB is denominated.  This reduces the amount of domestic currency needed to repay the loan, thereby decreasing the currency risk for the firm. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Important Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **US Federal Reserve:** The central bank of the United States, responsible for monetary policy, including setting interest rates and managing the money supply.  Its actions significantly impact global financial markets.\n\n* **Tight monetary policy:** A policy aimed at reducing inflation by decreasing the money supply and raising interest rates. This can curb economic growth.\n\n* **Capital flight:** A large-scale movement of capital out of a country, often due to economic or political instability. It can negatively impact the exchange rate and economic growth.\n\n* **External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs):** Loans raised by domestic entities from foreign lenders, usually in foreign currencies.  They provide access to cheaper funding but expose borrowers to currency risk.\n\n* **Currency risk:** The risk that the value of a currency will change, affecting the value of assets or liabilities denominated in that currency.  It is a major concern for international transactions.\n\n* **Devaluation:** A deliberate downward adjustment of a country's currency value relative to other currencies. It can make exports cheaper but also increase import costs.\n"

Because of this reduced risk, convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. Statement 1 is correct.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While rising stock prices benefit the bondholder through the conversion option, convertible bonds do not inherently offer indexation to rising consumer prices.

While the government has significant control over wild animals under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,  it doesn't imply sole ownership.  The Act focuses on conservation and regulation, not outright ownership.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the protection of scheduled animals irrespective of their location \u2013 within or outside protected areas. The law aims to protect these animals throughout their range.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Act allows for the capture or killing of protected animals if they pose a danger to human life. This is a provision to address human-wildlife conflict situations.  However, such actions are subject to specific regulations and procedures.\n\n\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972: This Act is the primary legislation in India for protecting wild animals and their habitats.  It schedules various species according to their conservation status and regulates activities related to them.\n\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960: This Act aims to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on animals.  It is relevant to wildlife protection insofar as it prohibits cruelty during capture, handling, or other interactions with wild animals.\n\nHuman-Animal Conflict: This refers to conflicts arising from interactions between humans and wild animals, often stemming from habitat encroachment, resource competition, or animal attacks.  The Wildlife Protection Act addresses this issue through provisions for dealing with dangerous animals.\n\nProtected Areas: These are designated areas where wildlife is afforded special protection. Examples include National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries.  The legal framework ensures stricter enforcement within these areas but also extends protection to animals outside them.\n"

Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are the primary contributors.  SO2 reacts with water to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and NOx reacts with water to form nitric acid (HNO3). Both are strong acids.  While ozone (O3) is a pollutant and contributes to various environmental problems, it does not directly contribute to acid rain in the same way as SO2 and NOx. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas but doesn't contribute to acid rain. Therefore, only SO2 and NOx are directly responsible for acid rain among the given options.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless, and highly toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. It binds to hemoglobin in blood, reducing oxygen transport. Sources include vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and incomplete burning of fuels.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx):  A group of gases including nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formed during high-temperature combustion processes.
