        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation:The Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) grants significant powers to Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.  Statement 1 is correct as PESA empowers Gram Sabhas to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.  Statement 2 is also correct; Gram Sabhas have ownership rights over minor forest produce.  Finally, statement 3 is correct because PESA mandates that the Gram Sabha's recommendation is necessary for granting prospecting licenses or mining leases for any mineral within Scheduled Areas.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.\n\nGram Sabha:  A Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of a Panchayat at the village level. It's a crucial institution for local self-governance, particularly in Scheduled Areas.\n\nScheduled Areas: These are areas designated under the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, primarily inhabited by tribal populations, requiring special protection and governance mechanisms.\n\nPanchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA): This Act empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas, giving them significant control over local resources and development.  It aims to ensure the self-governance of tribal communities.\n\nMinor Forest Produce: This refers to non-timber forest products gathered from forests, such as fruits, roots, medicinal plants, etc.  These products are often crucial for the livelihoods of tribal communities.\n"

        "year": 2012,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\nexplanation:The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) plays a crucial role in protecting India's agricultural biodiversity.  Statement 1 is correct because the NBA's primary function is to prevent biopiracy \u2013 the unauthorized appropriation of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge. This directly protects India's indigenous crop varieties and their genetic resources, which are essential for maintaining agricultural diversity and resilience. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NBA is involved in the overall regulation of access to biological resources, it does not directly monitor and supervise scientific research on genetic modification of crops. This falls under the purview of other regulatory bodies. Statement 3 is correct. The NBA's approval is mandatory before any application for Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) related to genetic or biological resources originating from India can be filed. This prevents the unauthorized patenting of Indian genetic resources and ensures that benefits are shared fairly.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.\n\nNational Biodiversity Authority (NBA):  The NBA is a statutory body established under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. Its main goal is to regulate access to India's biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, preventing biopiracy and ensuring equitable benefit-sharing.  It plays a vital role in conserving biodiversity and promoting sustainable use of biological resources.\n\nBiopiracy: The unauthorized appropriation of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, often by multinational corporations, for commercial purposes without providing any benefit to the source country or community.  This can lead to loss of genetic resources and traditional knowledge, impacting food security and cultural heritage.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPR): Legal rights granted to the creators of intellectual works, including inventions, designs, and biological resources.  IPR protection incentivizes innovation, but it is crucial to ensure that these rights do not undermine the rights of indigenous communities or nations over their traditional knowledge and biological resources.  The NBA ensures that this is maintained.\n"

Options 2 and 3, \"Organizing village Panchayats\" and \"Promoting cottage industries in rural areas,\" directly reflect Gandhi's emphasis on decentralized governance, rural self-sufficiency, and the empowerment of villages through local institutions and small-scale industries.  While Gandhi advocated for a uniform civil code in principle, it's not as central to his philosophy as the other two. Option 4, \"Securing for all workers reasonable leisure and cultural opportunities,\" aligns with Gandhi's vision of a society that values the well-being of its workers and provides them with opportunities for personal growth and development beyond mere economic sustenance. Therefore, options 2 and 3 most clearly reflect core Gandhian ideals.\n\n**Short Notes on Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Directive Principles of State Policy:**  Part IV of the Indian Constitution, these are non-justiciable guidelines for the state to follow when making laws and policies.

This is achieved through the damaging effects of UV radiation on the DNA of these microorganisms, preventing their replication and ultimately leading to their death.  UV radiation does not effectively remove odors or quicken sedimentation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation: A type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light, categorized into UVA, UVB, and UVC.

These are often present in water sources and need to be removed or inactivated for safe consumption.\n\nSedimentation: The process by which solid particles settle out of a liquid.  While UV radiation does not directly affect sedimentation, effective disinfection can help reduce the overall biological load in water, potentially leading to clearer water over time.

It established dyarchy in the provinces, dividing the executive branch into \"transferred\" (subjects under Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislature) and \"reserved\" (subjects under British officials).  The Act also introduced separate communal electorates, particularly for Muslims, allowing them to elect their representatives separately.  Finally, it devolved some legislative authority from the center to the provinces, granting them greater autonomy in certain areas. Therefore, all three statements (1, 2, and 3) are correct.\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Government of India Act 1919:** This Act aimed to introduce a degree of self-government in India, although it fell short of full independence. It was a landmark step in the evolution of India's political system, paving the way for future reforms.\n\n* **Dyarchy:**  A system of government where executive power is divided between two authorities. In the context of the 1919 Act, it meant a division of power between British officials and Indian ministers in the provinces.  It was a compromise that aimed to gradually introduce Indian participation in governance.\n\n* **Communal Electorates:** Separate electorates were established for different religious communities (Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, etc.) to ensure their representation in legislative bodies. This was a controversial measure that aimed to address the concerns of minority communities but also contributed to the growing communal divide in India.\n\n* **Devolution of Legislative Authority:**  The transfer of legislative powers from the central government to the provincial governments.

It aims to increase domestic manufacturing capabilities, attract investment, and create jobs.\n\n2. **Focus on reducing compliance burden and initiating reforms at the state level:** The text mentions that the Government of India is working to reduce the regulatory hurdles for businesses and is undertaking reforms at the state level to create a more conducive business environment.  This is reflected in initiatives like the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP).\n\n3.  **Promoting exports through district-level competition and job creation:** The text highlights efforts to increase exports by supporting manufacturing at the district level, fostering competition, and creating employment opportunities.\n\nWhile the options mentioned in the question aren't explicitly detailed as separate, comprehensive initiatives, the government's actions described strongly support all three.  Setting up National Investment and Manufacturing Zones would fall under the broader goal of creating a more conducive business environment (option 2).  Establishing a Technology Acquisition and Development Fund would likely be part of the broader technological push within the PLI scheme and other initiatives aimed at fostering innovation (option 1 & 3).

This is a crucial step in ensuring transparency and accountability. The Annual Financial Statement is a detailed document outlining the government's planned revenue and expenditure for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\n2. **Withdrawal of moneys from the Consolidated Fund of India only after passing the Appropriation Bill:**  No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India (the main account of the government) without the Parliament's approval through an Appropriation Bill. This ensures that the government spends only what the Parliament has authorized. The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary account where all government revenues are deposited and from which all government expenditures are made.\n\n3. **Provisions of supplementary grants and vote-on-account:** Supplementary grants allow the government to seek additional funds during the year if unforeseen expenses arise. A vote-on-account provides temporary funding to the government until the annual budget is passed.  Supplementary grants are additional funds requested by the government beyond the original budget allocation, while a vote-on-account is a short-term measure to allow the government to continue functioning when the budget is delayed.\n\n5. **Introducing the Finance Bill in the Parliament:** The Finance Bill incorporates the government's tax proposals for the year. The Parliament scrutinizes and approves this bill, giving it the power to influence government revenue.  The Finance Bill contains the government's proposals for taxation and other financial measures for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\n4. **A periodic or at least a mid-year review of the programme of the Government, against macroeconomic forecasts and expenditure by a Parliamentary Budget Office:** While desirable for enhanced parliamentary oversight, a dedicated Parliamentary Budget Office  is not explicitly mentioned as a constitutional mechanism for parliamentary control over public finance in India.  Therefore, this option is not a standard or established method.  A Parliamentary Budget Office would provide independent analysis of the government's budget and spending to aid the Parliament in its oversight role.\n"

Therefore, the correct order is 2, 3, 1.\n\nDemographic Transition Model: This model describes the shift in population growth patterns as a country develops economically and socially. It involves stages characterized by changes in birth and death rates, ultimately leading to a stable or slowly growing population.\n\nStage 1 (Low birthrate with low death rate): This stage represents a mature, developed economy with low birth and death rates, resulting in slow population growth or even decline.  High levels of education, access to healthcare, and family planning contribute to this.\n\nStage 2 (High birthrate with high death rate):  This is the pre-industrial stage characterized by high birth and death rates, resulting in minimal population growth.  High infant mortality, limited access to healthcare, and lack of family planning are common.\n\nStage 3 (High birthrate with low death rate): This is the transitional stage where death rates decline significantly due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and food production. Birth rates remain high, leading to rapid population growth.\n\nThomas Malthus:  An 18th-century economist who proposed a theory that population growth would outpace food production, leading to widespread famine, disease, and conflict.  His theory highlighted the potential for population pressures to limit economic development.\n\nCrude Sex Ratio: This is the ratio of males to females in a population, typically expressed as the number of males per 1000 females.  It is a demographic indicator reflecting gender imbalances within a population.\n\nAge Structure: This refers to the distribution of a population across different age groups.  It's a crucial demographic indicator because it reveals insights into a population\u2019s potential for growth, its dependency ratio, and the needs for services like education and healthcare.\n\nAge-Sex Pyramid: A graphical representation of the age and sex structure of a population.

The revolution of the Earth around the sun has no direct effect on ocean currents. Therefore, factors 1, 2, and 3 influence ocean currents.\n\nRotation of the Earth: The Earth's rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which deflects moving objects (including ocean currents) to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This significantly impacts the direction and patterns of ocean currents.\n\nAir pressure and wind: Wind is a major driving force of surface ocean currents.  Differences in air pressure create wind, and the wind drags on the ocean surface, causing water to move.\n\nDensity of ocean water: Differences in water density (caused by variations in temperature and salinity) drive deep ocean currents.  Colder, saltier water is denser and sinks, creating a flow of water from the poles towards the equator.  This is known as thermohaline circulation.\n\nRevolution of the Earth: The Earth's revolution around the sun primarily affects climate patterns and seasons, which indirectly influence ocean temperatures and salinity, but it doesn't directly drive the movement of ocean currents in the way that rotation, wind, and density do.\n"

Increased acidity, primarily caused by the absorption of excess atmospheric CO2 by the oceans, directly impacts organisms that build shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as calcareous phytoplankton and coral reefs.  This hinders their growth and survival (statements 1 and 2).

This aimed to suppress dissent and revolutionary activities.\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Rowlatt Act:**  This controversial legislation, officially known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act,  was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council despite widespread Indian opposition. It bypassed normal legal processes, enabling indefinite detention without charge or trial. This fueled widespread protests and ultimately contributed to the escalating tensions that led to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\n* **Khilafat Movement:** A movement launched by Indian Muslims in the early 20th century to protect the Ottoman Caliphate (the religious and political leader of Muslims) from Allied powers after World War I. The movement demonstrated the potential for Hindu-Muslim unity in the Indian nationalist struggle.\n\n* **Compulsory economic support to war efforts:** This refers to measures implemented by governments during wartime to secure financial and material resources for the military.  It could involve taxation, rationing, and conscription.\n\n* **Suppression of the Khilafat Movement:** The British government's actions to suppress the Khilafat Movement stemmed from their desire to maintain control in India and protect their interests in the Middle East.\n\n* **Imposition of restrictions on freedom of the press:**  The British government frequently imposed restrictions on the Indian press to control the flow of information and limit criticism of their policies.  This was a common tool for suppressing dissent.\n\n* **Lord Minto:**  The Viceroy of India (1905-1910), known for introducing the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, which included the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. This was a significant step towards the further division of Indian politics along communal lines.\n\n* **Morley-Minto Reforms:**  A series of constitutional reforms introduced in 1909 that expanded Indian representation in legislative councils but also introduced separate electorates for Muslims, furthering communal divisions.\n\n* **Simla Deputation:** A delegation of Muslim leaders who met with Lord Minto in 1906 to advocate for separate electorates for Muslims.\n\n* **Jallianwala Bagh Massacre:** A tragic event that occurred on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, India, where British troops fired upon a peaceful gathering of Indian civilians, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries.  It significantly fueled anti-British sentiment and escalated the Indian independence movement.\n\n* **Gandhi:**  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a prominent leader of Indian nationalism, known for his philosophy of Satyagraha (passive resistance) and his role in leading India to independence.\n\n* **Montford Reforms:** Also known as the Government of India Act 1919, these reforms introduced limited self-government in India but fell short of satisfying Indian aspirations for full independence.\n\n* **Mahatma Gandhi:**  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a leader of the Indian independence movement who championed non-violent resistance.\n\n* **Satyagraha:** A philosophy and practice of non-violent resistance developed and championed by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n* **Non-Cooperation Movement:** A major non-violent movement launched by Gandhi in 1920 to oppose British rule in India.\n\n* **Lucknow Pact:** An agreement between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League in 1916 that aimed to foster Hindu-Muslim unity in the struggle for self-rule.\n\n* **Defence of India Act 1915:** This act gave the British government in India broad powers to suppress dissent and maintain order during World War I.

It evolved from a moderate organization to one encompassing various ideologies and strategies, eventually adopting the goal of complete independence.\n\nLahore Session (1929): A landmark session of the Indian National Congress held in Lahore, Pakistan (then part of British India), where the declaration of Purna Swaraj was adopted.  This marked a shift towards a more assertive and radical approach to achieving independence.\n\nPurna Swaraj:  A Hindi term meaning \"complete independence\" or \"self-rule.\"  Its adoption as the official goal of the Indian National Congress at the Lahore Session signaled a decisive break from earlier negotiations and compromises with the British government.\n\nTwo-nation theory: A political ideology advocating for the division of India into separate Hindu and Muslim states.  This theory was primarily championed by the Muslim League and played a crucial role in the Partition of India in 1947.  The Lahore Session of the Congress did not directly address this theory.\n\nExtremists:  A faction within the Indian National Congress advocating for more radical and assertive methods to achieve independence from British rule.\n\nModerates: A faction within the Indian National Congress favoring a more gradual and conciliatory approach to gaining independence from British rule.

Statement 2 is correct because many Indian power plants rely on coal, and domestic supply often falls short of their needs. This leads to the necessity of importing coal to meet the energy demand. Statement 3 is also correct as steel production requires significant amounts of coking coal, a specific type of coal not readily available in sufficient quantities within India, necessitating imports. Statement 1, however, is incorrect. While there might be some strategic considerations regarding the use of domestic reserves, it's not the primary reason for coal imports. The main driver is the insufficient domestic supply to meet the burgeoning energy and industrial demands.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Coal:** A combustible black or dark brown sedimentary rock formed from decayed plant matter.

If capillarity did not exist:\n\n1. Kerosene lamps would be difficult to use because the kerosene would not rise through the wick by capillary action.\n\n2. Using a straw to drink a soft drink would be impossible; the liquid would not rise into the straw.\n\n3. Blotting paper relies on capillarity to absorb liquids; it would be ineffective without it.\n\n4.  Capillary action is crucial for water transport in large trees.  Water moves from the roots to the leaves against gravity through tiny vessels, a process aided by capillarity. Without it, large trees would struggle to obtain sufficient water, hindering their growth.\n\n\nKerosene: A combustible hydrocarbon liquid, used as fuel.\nStraw: A slender tube, typically made from straw or plastic, used for drinking beverages.\nBlotting paper: An absorbent paper used to remove excess liquid from a surface.\nBig trees: Tall trees, requiring efficient water transport systems.\n"

This practice helps in carbon sequestration by reducing soil erosion, which leads to the loss of organic matter. Relay cropping involves planting a second crop before the first crop is harvested. This increases the biomass and organic matter in the soil, contributing to carbon sequestration. Zero tillage farming involves planting crops directly into the soil without plowing or tilling. This leaves the soil undisturbed, preserving soil structure and increasing organic matter accumulation, which enhances carbon sequestration.

Vultures that feed on carcasses of treated cattle ingest the drug, which is toxic to them, causing kidney failure and death.  This has led to a drastic reduction in vulture numbers.\n\nOther options are less likely causes:\n\n(a) The destruction of nesting sites by invasive species is a possible factor affecting some bird populations, but it's not the primary reason for the widespread decline of vultures in India.\n\n(c)  While food scarcity can impact vulture populations, the diclofenac poisoning is a more significant and direct cause of their decline.\n\n(d) While diseases can affect any population, a widespread, persistent, and fatal disease affecting vultures hasn't been the main factor behind the observed decline.  Diclofenac poisoning is the confirmed primary cause.\n\n\n**Named Entities and Keywords:**\n\n* **Vultures:** Large birds of prey that feed on carrion (dead animals).  Several vulture species are found in India, and many are critically endangered.  Their role in the ecosystem is significant, as they help remove carcasses, preventing the spread of disease.\n\n* **Indian countryside:** Refers to the rural areas of India, where vultures were once common.  The decline of vultures has significant ecological consequences for this environment.\n\n* **Diclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation in cattle.  It is highly toxic to vultures, even in small doses. The widespread use of diclofenac in veterinary medicine is the primary cause of the decline in vulture populations.\n\n* **Cattle owners:** Individuals who raise and care for cattle. Their practices, particularly the use of diclofenac, have had a devastating impact on vulture populations.\n\n* **Diseased cattle:**  Cattle suffering from illnesses or injuries. The treatment of these animals with diclofenac has unintentionally caused the deaths of numerous vultures.\n\n* **Invasive species:** Organisms that are not native to a particular area and whose introduction causes ecological damage.  While this is a general ecological concern, it is not the main factor for vulture decline in India.\n\n* **Food:**  The carrion (dead animals) that vultures consume. The availability of food can affect vulture populations, but diclofenac poisoning is a more direct threat.\n\n\n"
