        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\nexplanation:The Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative focuses on environmentally friendly and economically sustainable practices.  Let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **Seed cost:** While the provided text doesn't directly address seed costs in the initiative, it's plausible that using methods like intercropping or promoting specific varieties could indirectly lower seed costs compared to conventional methods. However, this isn't definitively stated.\n\n2. **Drip irrigation:** Drip irrigation is highly efficient in water usage, a key element of sustainability.  The initiative likely promotes water-efficient methods like drip irrigation.\n\n3. **Chemical fertilizers:** The absence of chemical/inorganic fertilizers is a core principle of sustainable agriculture, minimizing environmental damage and promoting soil health. This aligns perfectly with the initiative's goals.\n\n4. **Intercropping:** Intercropping increases biodiversity and can improve soil health and reduce pest pressure, which are all sustainable practices. The initiative's emphasis on sustainability makes this highly likely.\n\nTherefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 strongly align with the principles of a sustainable sugarcane initiative.  Statement 1 is plausible but not definitively supported by the provided information.\n\n**Short notes on keywords and named entities:**\n\n* **Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative:** An agricultural approach focusing on environmentally friendly and economically viable sugarcane production, emphasizing practices like reduced chemical input, efficient water use, and biodiversity.\n\n* **Drip irrigation:** A water-efficient irrigation method delivering water directly to plant roots, minimizing water waste and improving water use efficiency compared to traditional methods.\n\n* **Intercropping:**  A farming practice where two or more crops are grown simultaneously on the same land, enhancing biodiversity, soil health, and potentially reducing pest and weed issues.  It also optimizes resource utilization.\n\n* **Chemical/Inorganic fertilizers:**  Synthetic fertilizers made from minerals or chemicals, providing nutrients to plants but potentially causing environmental harm through water pollution and soil degradation if used improperly.  Sustainable agriculture seeks to reduce or eliminate dependence on these.\n"

Respiration, the process by which organisms release energy from organic molecules, produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Decay of organic matter involves the breakdown of dead plants and animals, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis, however, consumes carbon dioxide and converts it into organic matter.  Therefore, only volcanic action, respiration, and decay of organic matter add carbon dioxide to the carbon cycle.\n\nVolcanic action:  Volcanoes release various gases, including significant amounts of carbon dioxide, from the Earth's mantle. This is a natural process that has contributed to atmospheric CO2 levels throughout Earth's history.\n\nRespiration:  All living organisms, from plants and animals to microorganisms, respire.  Respiration is the process of breaking down organic molecules (like sugars) to release energy.  Carbon dioxide is a waste product of this process and is released into the atmosphere.\n\nPhotosynthesis: Plants and other photosynthetic organisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.  This process removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and incorporates it into organic molecules.\n\nDecay of organic matter: When organisms die, their organic matter is broken down by decomposers (bacteria and fungi).  This decomposition process releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere and the soil.\n"

Therefore, all four pollutants listed are significant emissions from the Indian steel industry.\n\nOxides of Sulfur (SOx):  These gases are primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2), a major air pollutant causing respiratory problems and acid rain.  Steel production often involves sulfur-containing materials, leading to SOx emissions unless mitigation technologies are employed.\n\nOxides of Nitrogen (NOx):  These gases, including nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are formed at high temperatures in combustion processes. They contribute to acid rain, smog, and respiratory issues.  Steelmaking involves significant heat generation, leading to NOx formation.\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless, and toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels.  Steel production uses large quantities of fuel, and incomplete combustion can lead to significant CO emissions.\n\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2): A greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.  Steel production is a significant source of CO2 emissions due to the energy-intensive nature of the processes involved.

He was born in the Shakya clan of Kapilavastu, which was located in the region of Kosala.  His teachings spread through Kosala and into Magadha, where the religion gained significant followers and royal patronage. Avanti was a powerful kingdom, but its connection to the Buddha's life is less direct compared to Kosala and Magadha.  Gandhara, located in the northwest, became important for Buddhism later, but it did not play a major role during Buddha's lifetime. Therefore, Kosala and Magadha, along with Avanti, are associated with the Buddha\u2019s life.\n\n\nAvanti:  A powerful kingdom in ancient India, known for its strong rulers and flourishing urban centers like Ujjain. Its location in central India placed it on important trade routes.  While not directly central to Buddha's life, its proximity to other important kingdoms means it was likely aware of the rising influence of Buddhism.\n\nGandhara: A region in northwestern India and Pakistan, known for its unique blend of Indian and Central Asian cultures.  Gandhara art, particularly its depiction of Buddha, became famous later.  It was not a major player during the Buddha's lifetime.\n\nKosala:  A large kingdom in ancient India, encompassing present-day eastern Uttar Pradesh and parts of Nepal.  The Buddha was born in the Shakya clan in Kapilavastu, which was part of Kosala.  The kingdom played a significant role in the early spread of Buddhism.\n\nMagadha: A powerful kingdom in eastern India, its capital was initially Rajgir and later Pataliputra (modern Patna). Magadha's strategic location, fertile lands, and strong rulers contributed to its growth and influence.  The kingdom played a crucial role in the later development and spread of Buddhism, with powerful rulers embracing the faith.  It became a center of Buddhist learning.\n"

While options (a), (b), and (c) contain elements of the plan's objectives, option (d) most accurately reflects the overarching goal as stated in the provided text.  Inclusive growth, as defined by the UNDP, emphasizes equal participation and benefit-sharing in economic growth.  Sustainable growth focuses on environmental considerations and long-term viability.  The plan aimed to achieve both simultaneously, along with accelerating the pace of economic expansion.  The 10th Five-Year Plan (2002-07) had already introduced the concept of inclusive growth and equitable development, setting the stage for the 12th Plan to build upon this foundation with a stronger emphasis on sustainability.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (2007-12) also contributed by focusing on increasing the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education and implementing programs like the Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009, AAY, and NREGA.  These initiatives aimed to create a more inclusive and equitable society, facilitating the goals of the 12th Five-Year Plan.  The involvement of Panchayats and Municipalities, as seen in the 8th Five-Year Plan (1992-97), reflects a decentralized planning approach, which was also important for achieving inclusive growth.  The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) align with the broader aims of inclusive and sustainable development, focusing on poverty reduction, improved health, education, and environmental sustainability.  C. Rangarajan's work likely contributed to the economic policy framework of the Five-Year Plans.

By mandating banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves (CRR and SLR), the central bank limits the amount of money banks can lend out, thus influencing the overall money supply. While SRR contributes to the safety and liquidity of deposits, this is a secondary effect, not the primary purpose. Preventing excessive profits is not a direct aim of SRR; it's a potential consequence of controlling credit expansion.

Deforestation removes the protective cover of vegetation, leaving soil exposed to the erosive forces of wind and rain, especially prevalent in India's tropical climate characterized by heavy monsoons and intense rainfall. While terrace cultivation is a technique to reduce soil erosion on slopes, poorly managed terraces can still contribute to erosion if not properly maintained. Therefore, all three factors contribute to the problem.\n\nShort notes:\n\n* **Soil erosion:** The process of detachment and transportation of soil particles by natural agents like wind and water.  It leads to land degradation and loss of fertile topsoil.\n\n* **Terrace cultivation:** An agricultural technique where slopes are converted into a series of level terraces to reduce soil erosion and improve water retention.  However, improper construction or maintenance can lead to erosion.\n\n* **Deforestation:** The clearing of forests for other land uses, such as agriculture or urbanization. It significantly increases soil erosion risk by removing the protective cover of vegetation.\n\n* **Tropical climate:** A climate characterized by high temperatures and significant rainfall throughout the year or during specific seasons (monsoon).  Intense rainfall in tropical climates can cause significant soil erosion if the land is not protected by vegetation.\n\n* **India:** A large country in South Asia with diverse climates and geographical features, making it susceptible to various types of soil erosion.\n"

Statement 1 is incorrect because it suggests a government that restricts individual liberty for the sake of state power, which is antithetical to the core principles of a constitutional government. Statement 2 accurately reflects the purpose of a constitutional government: to limit state power to protect individual freedoms.\n\nA constitution is a set of fundamental principles that govern a state.  It allocates power, sets limits on government, protects fundamental rights, and reflects the aspirations of a society.  The Indian Constitution is a prime example of a modern constitution that fulfills these functions.  The Constituent Assembly of India drafted the constitution, drawing on various historical and international influences, and aiming for a balance between central and state powers, as well as individual liberties and social goals.  Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy are key elements of the Indian Constitution, representing legally enforceable rights and non-justiciable policy directives, respectively.  The Election Commission of India plays a crucial role in ensuring free and fair elections, and the judiciary protects and interprets the Constitution.  The structure of the Indian government is a parliamentary system, with the President as Head of State and the Prime Minister as Head of Government.  The executive branch is responsible for implementing laws and policies, while the legislature (Parliament) makes laws, controls the executive, and represents the people.  The judiciary is independent and responsible for upholding the rule of law and interpreting the Constitution.  Federalism in India involves a division of powers between the central government and state governments, with the Supreme Court resolving disputes.  Local governments (Panchayats and Nagarpalikas) also play a vital role in democratic governance.  The Constitution has been amended numerous times to adapt to changing needs and circumstances, but its basic structure remains intact, thanks to the doctrine of basic structure developed by the judiciary.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: Nanoparticles of chemical elements used in industry are a concern for several reasons.  They can accumulate in the environment, contaminating water and soil (1). This contamination can then lead to nanoparticles entering the food chain (2), potentially causing bioaccumulation and biomagnification.  Furthermore, nanoparticles can trigger the production of free radicals (3), which are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells and tissues, leading to various health problems.  Therefore, all three statements are valid concerns.\n\n**Short notes on keywords and named entities:**\n\n* **Nanoparticles:**  Extremely small particles with at least one dimension less than 100 nanometers (nm).  Their small size gives them unique properties compared to larger particles of the same material, leading to a wide range of applications but also potential risks.\n\n* **Chemical elements:**  Pure substances consisting of only one type of atom. Many chemical elements, in nanoparticle form, are used in various industrial applications.\n\n* **Industry:** The sector of an economy concerned with the production of goods.  Industrial processes often involve the use of nanoparticles due to their unique properties.\n\n* **Free radicals:** Unstable molecules with unpaired electrons, making them highly reactive.  They can damage cells and DNA, contributing to aging and various diseases.  Nanoparticles can increase the production of free radicals in biological systems.\n\n* **Food chains:**  The interconnected network of organisms where energy and nutrients are transferred from one organism to another through consumption.  The entry of nanoparticles into food chains can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.\n\n* **Bioaccumulation:** The gradual accumulation of substances, such as nanoparticles, in the tissues of organisms over time.\n\n* **Biomagnification:** The increasing concentration of substances as they move up the food chain, leading to higher levels in top predators.\n\n* **Water and soil contamination:** The presence of harmful substances in water bodies and soil, which can negatively impact ecosystems and human health. Nanoparticles can contribute to this contamination.\n"
