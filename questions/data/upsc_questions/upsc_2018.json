The Swatantra Party was a significant opposition party in the first Lok Sabha, but it wasn't the single largest.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was formally recognized for the first time in 1969. Before this, there was no official recognition of the leader of the largest opposition party.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The current rules require a party to have at least 1/10th of the total strength of the Lok Sabha (which translates to approximately 55 members in a house of 545) for its leader to be officially recognized as the Leader of the Opposition.  While the question states 75, the actual number is closer to 55.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Named Entities:**\n\n* **Lok Sabha:** The lower house of the Parliament of India.  It is directly elected by the people and is the more powerful of the two houses.  Its members debate and pass legislation.\n\n* **Swatantra Party:** A right-wing political party in India active from 1959 to 1974. It advocated for free markets and limited government intervention.  It was a major opposition party in the early years of independent India.\n\n* **Leader of the Opposition:** The leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha (upper house).  This position holds significant political influence and provides a check on the ruling government.  The leader is officially recognized only if their party meets a certain minimum membership threshold.\n\n* **Rajya Sabha:** The upper house of the Parliament of India.  It has less power than the Lok Sabha but plays a vital role in scrutinizing legislation.  Members are partly elected and partly nominated.\n"

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established by an Act of Parliament, specifically the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on the other hand, was established by an executive order of the Government of India under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The NGT is a specialized environmental court designed to provide speedy and effective environmental justice. It aims to reduce the burden on higher courts by handling environmental disputes. The CPCB, a statutory body, is primarily responsible for monitoring and controlling pollution levels in the country. Its functions include setting standards for pollution, monitoring pollution levels, and enforcing regulations aimed at improving air and water quality.

The provided text mentions India being a large importer of edible oils and also a significant producer, but it doesn't offer data to directly compare domestic production and import quantities over the last five years.

While the text doesn't explicitly state the current customs duty policy on imported edible oils, it's highly improbable that the government would impose *no* customs duty on all imported edible oils. Governments typically use tariffs to protect domestic industries and generate revenue.  The goal of price stabilization (mentioned in the context) might involve some adjustments to import duties but completely eliminating them is unlikely.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Important Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Edible Oils:** Oils extracted from plants (e.g., palm oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil) and used in cooking and food preparation.  India is both a producer and a large consumer, often relying on imports to meet its demand.\n\n* **Domestic Production:** The amount of edible oils produced within a country's borders.  Factors like weather, technology, and government policies influence domestic production levels.\n\n* **Imported Edible Oils:** Edible oils brought into a country from other nations.  Imports are often necessary to supplement domestic production, especially when demand is high.\n\n* **Customs Duty:** A tax imposed on goods imported into a country.  It's a tool used by governments to control imports, protect domestic industries, and generate revenue.\n\n* **Price Stabilization:** Government policies and measures aimed at preventing excessive price fluctuations in essential commodities like edible oils.  These policies may include import duties, stock limits, and other interventions.\n\n* **Government:** Refers to the Indian government, which plays a significant role in regulating the agricultural sector, including edible oil production and trade.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a measure of a bank's available capital expressed as a percentage of a bank's risk-weighted credit exposures.  While it does help offset losses, it's not specifically tied to account holders failing to repay dues; it covers a broader range of potential losses.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAR is not decided by individual banks; it's a regulatory requirement set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) based on international standards like Basel Accords.  The RBI sets minimum CAR levels that banks must maintain to ensure their financial stability and protect depositors' funds.\n\n\n**Short notes on keywords and named entities:**\n\n* **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):** A regulatory measure of a bank's financial strength, representing the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets.  A higher CAR indicates a greater ability to absorb losses.  It is crucial for maintaining financial stability and protecting depositors.\n\n* **Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** India's central bank, responsible for regulating the country's banking and financial system.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\n\nexplanation:The Rule of Law emphasizes that everyone, including those in power, is subject to and accountable under the law.  This inherently involves limitations on power (1) and equality before the law (2).  Liberty and civil rights (4) are also protected under the Rule of Law, as it ensures that fundamental rights are upheld and arbitrary exercise of power is prevented.  However, \"People's responsibility to the Government\" (3) is not a core feature of the Rule of Law. While citizens have responsibilities, the Rule of Law primarily focuses on the government's responsibility to uphold the law and respect the rights of its citizens.\n\n**Short notes:**\n\n* **Rule of Law:** A principle ensuring everyone, regardless of status, is accountable under publicly promulgated laws. It promotes justice, protects rights, and prevents arbitrary governance.  The absence of it leads to tyranny and injustice.\n\n* **Limitation of Powers:**  This prevents any branch of government or individual from exceeding their lawful authority, safeguarding individual liberties and preventing abuse of power.  Checks and balances are crucial to implementing this.\n\n* **Equality before the law:**  All individuals are treated equally under the law, irrespective of social status, wealth, or political influence. This principle ensures fairness and prevents discrimination in the application of legal processes.\n\n* **People's responsibility to the Government:** While citizens have a duty to obey laws and participate in civic life, this is not a defining feature of the Rule of Law itself.  The Rule of Law primarily concerns the government's obligations.\n\n* **Liberty and civil rights:**  These are fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed to individuals under the Rule of Law, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion, and protection against arbitrary arrest or detention.  These are essential for a just and free society.\n\n* **NV Raman (CJI):**  This refers to a Chief Justice of India (though the provided text doesn't specify which one).  CJIs play a vital role in upholding the Rule of Law within a country's judicial system.\n\n\n"

        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (c)\n* **explanation:** An increase in absolute and per capita real GNP (Gross National Product) signifies economic growth, but not necessarily economic development.  Economic development encompasses broader improvements in living standards, including poverty reduction and employment generation. If poverty and unemployment increase despite rising GNP, it indicates that the economic growth is not translating into widespread benefits for the population, hence not connoting higher economic development.\n\nReal GNP:  Real GNP adjusts nominal GNP for inflation, providing a more accurate picture of economic output growth.\n\nPer Capita Real GNP: This metric divides real GNP by the population, showing the average income per person.  A higher value suggests increased average wealth, but doesn't reflect income distribution.\n\nPoverty: A state of deprivation characterized by a lack of access to basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare.  High poverty rates, even with economic growth, signal unequal distribution of wealth.\n\nUnemployment: The state of being without a job while actively seeking employment. High unemployment indicates underutilization of human resources and reduced income for a significant portion of the population.\n\nOption (a) and (b) focus on sectoral imbalances (agriculture vs. industry). While such imbalances can hinder development, they don't automatically negate the possibility of improved development if other factors, such as poverty and unemployment, are addressed. Option (d) focuses on the trade balance (imports vs. exports). A trade deficit can be a symptom of economic issues, but again, it doesn't directly contradict the possibility of development if other indicators improve.\n"

This is because the productivity of capital is low, meaning the efficiency of converting savings into output is low.\n\nHigh capital-output ratio: This refers to the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. A high ratio indicates inefficiency in capital utilization, meaning that a large investment is needed to achieve a small increase in production.\n\nWeak administrative machinery: Inefficient bureaucracy and lack of proper implementation of policies can hamper economic growth.\n\nIlliteracy: A less educated workforce is less productive and may not be able to effectively utilize advanced technology and capital.\n\nHigh population density: While not directly related to capital formation, high population density can put pressure on resources and infrastructure, potentially hindering economic progress.\n"

While the British initially focused on mercantilism and monopolizing trade, the later stages saw a shift towards free trade, though heavily favoring British interests. This led to the increased production of cash crops for export to Britain, fundamentally altering the agricultural landscape and making it more market-oriented. This contrasts with options (a), (b), and (d):\n\n(a) **Increase in the export of Indian handicrafts:**  British policies actually led to the decline of Indian handicrafts due to competition from British manufactured goods and the redirection of resources towards cash crops.  Handicrafts, a significant part of the Indian economy, suffered immensely under colonial rule.\n\n(b) **Growth in the number of Indian-owned factories:** The British promoted the development of industries that benefited their own economy, not necessarily fostering the growth of Indian-owned factories.  Instead, deindustrialization occurred in many sectors.\n\n(d) **Rapid increase in the urban population:** While urbanization did occur to some extent, it was not a rapid or widespread phenomenon compared to the transformative impact of the commercialization of agriculture.  The British primarily focused on exploiting resources and establishing infrastructure that served their own economic objectives.\n\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **British rule in India (19th century):**  This period saw the consolidation of British power in India, characterized by economic exploitation, political subjugation, and significant social and cultural changes.

These were largely suppressed under British rule.\n\n* **Commercialization of Indian agriculture:** The transformation of Indian agriculture from subsistence farming to cash-crop production driven by market forces, primarily to meet the demands of the British Empire. This often led to displacement of farmers and ecological damage.\n\n* **Mercantilism:** An economic system where a nation's power is directly related to its wealth, often achieved through trade monopolies and the accumulation of precious metals.

The Earth's magnetic field has indeed reversed numerous times throughout its history, with reversals occurring roughly every few hundred thousand years, although the intervals are not perfectly regular.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The early Earth's atmosphere was very different from today's.  It had very little free oxygen (O2) and likely contained significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and other gases. The 54% oxygen figure is far too high for the early Earth. The presence of significant amounts of free oxygen is a relatively recent phenomenon in Earth's history, largely due to the evolution of photosynthetic organisms.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The evolution of life, particularly photosynthetic organisms, dramatically altered the Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis led to the gradual increase in atmospheric oxygen and a decrease in carbon dioxide, fundamentally changing the composition of the atmosphere and paving the way for the evolution of more complex life forms.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\nexplanation: Conservation agriculture is a farming system that aims to conserve arable land, regenerate degraded lands, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.  The three main principles are:  minimum soil disturbance (minimum tillage), permanent soil cover (using crop residues), and diversification of plant species (crop rotations and intercropping).\n\nOption 1: Avoiding monoculture practices is beneficial for soil health and biodiversity, but it's not a core principle of conservation agriculture.  Monoculture is the practice of growing a single crop species in a field repeatedly.\n\nOption 2: Minimum tillage is a core principle. Minimum tillage farming involves reducing the amount of soil disturbance during planting and cultivation.\n\nOption 3: Avoiding cultivation of plantation crops is not a principle of conservation agriculture. Plantation crops are a type of cropping system.\n\nOption 4: Using crop residues to cover the soil surface is a core principle.  Crop residues are the leftover plant material after harvest, such as stalks, leaves, and stems.\n\nOption 5: Adopting spatial and temporal crop sequencing/crop rotations is a core principle. Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in a field over time. Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in the same field simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, only options 2, 4, and 5 align with the core principles of conservation agriculture.  Options 1 and 3 are not directly related to the core tenets of conservation agriculture.\n"

        "year": 2018,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\n\nexplanation: The term \"sixth mass extinction\" or \"sixth extinction\" is frequently used in news reports to describe the ongoing, human-caused loss of biodiversity.  Option (d) accurately reflects this, citing mankind's actions as the primary driver: overexploitation of resources, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.  These factors are all significant contributors to the decline in species populations and ecosystems worldwide.\n\nMonoculture (a) and genetically modified crops (c) contribute to biodiversity loss, but are not the sole or primary causes of the sixth mass extinction.  A meteorite impact (b), while a cause of past mass extinctions, is not the current context for the term \"sixth mass extinction.\"\n\n\n**Short Notes on Important Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Sixth mass extinction/sixth extinction:**  This refers to a period of accelerated species extinction currently underway, primarily driven by human activities.  It's characterized by a significantly higher rate of species loss than the background extinction rate.  Scientists debate the precise criteria and timing, but the overwhelming consensus points to a substantial biodiversity crisis.\n\n* **Monoculture:**  An agricultural practice where a single crop is cultivated over a large area.  This reduces biodiversity within the agricultural landscape and can make the system vulnerable to pests and diseases.  It often leads to the depletion of soil nutrients and requires heavy pesticide use.\n\n* **Genetically modified crops:** Crops whose genetic material has been altered using biotechnology. While offering potential benefits like increased yields and pest resistance, concerns exist about the impact on biodiversity, particularly the potential for gene flow to wild relatives and the displacement of traditional crop varieties.\n\n* **Overexploitation/misuse of natural resources:** The unsustainable use of natural resources, exceeding the rate at which they can replenish. This includes overfishing, deforestation, and excessive mining, leading to resource depletion and ecosystem damage.\n\n* **Fragmentation/loss of natural habitats:** The breaking up of large, continuous habitats into smaller, isolated patches. This reduces the available space for species, restricts their movement, and makes them more vulnerable to extinction.\n\n* **Destruction of ecosystems:** The significant alteration or complete loss of natural ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, and coral reefs, due to human activities.  This leads to a cascade of negative impacts on biodiversity, climate regulation, and other ecosystem services.\n\n* **Pollution:** The contamination of the environment with harmful substances, including air, water, and soil pollution. Pollution can directly kill organisms, disrupt ecosystems, and contribute to climate change.\n\n* **Global climate change:** Long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Climate change alters habitats, disrupts ecological processes, and leads to species extinctions.\n\n* **Biodiversity loss:** The decline in the variety of life on Earth, encompassing species, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity. It is a major concern with far-reaching consequences for human well-being and the planet.\n\n* **IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change):** A scientific body established by the United Nations to assess the science related to climate change.  The IPCC provides regular reports summarizing the current state of knowledge on climate change, its impacts, and potential mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\n* **Amazon Basin:** The world's largest river basin, encompassing parts of several South American countries.  It is characterized by its exceptionally high biodiversity, including the Amazon rainforest, a crucial carbon sink and habitat for countless species.\n\n* **Ganga-Brahmaputra basin:** A large river basin in the Indian subcontinent, encompassing parts of several Indian states.  It is a densely populated area with rich agricultural lands and significant biodiversity, but faces challenges from pollution and development.\n\n* **Toucans:**  A family of brightly colored birds found in the Neotropics, known for their large, colorful bills.  They are arboreal (tree-dwelling) and are an important part of the rainforest ecosystem.\n\n* **Manioc (Cassava):** A starchy tuberous root crop, an important staple food in many tropical regions.  It is relatively drought-tolerant and can grow in poor soils, making it a valuable food source in challenging environments.\n\n* **Kolkata:** A major city in eastern India, located on the Hooghly River. It is a significant port city and a center of commerce and culture.\n\n* **Deodars and firs:** Types of coniferous trees commonly found in mountainous regions with cool climates, such as the Himalayas.  They are adapted to harsh conditions and have needle-like leaves.\n\n* **Bengal tiger:** A subspecies of tiger found in the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans delta in India and Bangladesh.  It is an endangered species.\n\n* **Piranha:** A genus of freshwater fish found in South America, known for their sharp teeth and predatory behavior.  Certain species are known to feed on flesh.\n\n* **Maloca:** A traditional communal dwelling found among some indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest.  They are often large structures with steeply sloping roofs.\n\n* **Bison (American buffalo):** A large, grazing mammal native to North America.  It was nearly driven to extinction by hunting but has since recovered through conservation efforts.\n\n* **Cowboys:**  Individuals who work on ranches, typically in the American West, managing cattle and other livestock.  Their traditional image is tied to horse riding and the use of lassoes.\n\n* **Velds:** The temperate grasslands of South Africa.  They are characterized by rolling plateaus and a varied landscape.\n\n* **Sahara desert:** The world's largest hot desert, located in North Africa.

It marked a pivotal moment where Gandhiji successfully mobilized peasants to fight for their rights, demonstrating the power of mass mobilization and civil disobedience in the struggle for independence.\n\nGandhiji:  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement, is known for his philosophy of Satyagraha (non-violent resistance) and his role in achieving India's independence from British rule. His leadership in Champaran Satyagraha was a crucial step in his rise to national prominence.\n\nChamparan Satyagraha: A non-violent resistance movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1917 in Champaran district of Bihar, India.  It focused on the plight of indigo farmers exploited by British planters.  The movement's success in achieving concessions for the farmers was a major turning point in the Indian independence movement.\n\nDalit and Tribal communities:  Dalits (formerly known as \"untouchables\") and Tribal communities represent marginalized groups in Indian society.

This marked a significant step towards government involvement in education, although the implementation was gradual and initially focused on Western knowledge.\n\n* **General Committee of Public Instruction, 1823:** Established to oversee the allocation of funds for education, this committee became the site of the Orientalist-Anglicist controversy.  This debate centered on whether to prioritize traditional Indian learning (Orientalist view) or Western knowledge through the English language (Anglicist view). The committee's existence and the controversy within it significantly shaped the direction of education policy.\n\n* **Orientalist and Anglicist Controversy:** This debate directly impacted the choice of medium of instruction and curriculum.
