The Jhelum River is the main source and flows through Wular Lake, which is located in Jammu and Kashmir, India.\n\n2. **Krishna River directly feeds Kolleru Lake:** This statement is **incorrect**.  Kolleru Lake is fed by several rivers, including the Krishna, but not directly.  The Krishna River's water reaches Kolleru Lake indirectly, through other smaller streams and channels.\n\n3. **Meandering of Gandak River formed Kanwar Lake:** This statement is **correct**. The meandering of the Gandak River, a tributary of the Ganges, is indeed responsible for the formation of Kanwar Lake in Bihar, India.\n\nTherefore, two out of the three statements are correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"

While green hydrogen *can* be burned in modified internal combustion engines, it's not efficient or practical in its current form.  Hydrogen combustion requires higher compression ratios and specialized engine designs to avoid pre-ignition and backfiring.  The efficiency is also lower compared to other fuel sources.\n\n2. **It can be blended with natural gas and used as fuel for heat or power generation:** This is **correct**.  Green hydrogen can be blended with natural gas in varying proportions (depending on the infrastructure) for use in power generation and heating applications.  This is a common pathway for integrating hydrogen into existing gas infrastructure.\n\n3. **It can be used in a hydrogen fuel cell to run vehicles:** This is **correct**.  Hydrogen fuel cells are the most efficient and clean way to utilize hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles.

        "explanation": "Both statements are correct.\n\nStatement 1: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital representations of a country's fiat currency.  Transactions using a CBDC would not necessarily rely on the US dollar or the SWIFT system.  A CBDC issued by, say, the European Central Bank, would allow transactions in Euros without needing to go through the dollar or SWIFT.\n\nStatement 2:  A key feature of many proposed CBDC designs is programmability.  This allows for the inclusion of conditions, such as time-limited validity or restrictions on how the currency can be spent.  For example, a CBDC could be programmed to only be usable for specific goods or services, or to expire after a certain date.\n"

While curative care (treating illnesses) is heavily emphasized, there's a relative lack of investment and focus on preventive measures (like vaccinations and health education), promoting healthy lifestyles, and rehabilitative services.\n\nStatement II is also true. India's healthcare system operates under a decentralized model, with significant responsibility and autonomy given to individual states in terms of planning, implementing, and managing their own health services.  The central government plays a role in setting policy guidelines and providing some funding, but the actual delivery of care is largely a state-level function.\n"

While India does have a large population,  it does *not* need to extract more than a quarter of the world's groundwater to meet its drinking water and sanitation needs.  The high extraction rate is due to a combination of factors including inefficient irrigation practices, lack of water infrastructure in some areas, and growing demand from a large and expanding population.  The high extraction rate is unsustainable and contributes to falling groundwater levels and other environmental issues.  Simply put, the need doesn't justify the excessive extraction.\n\n\nTherefore, only Statement I is likely correct.\n"

The Constitution of India exempts the States from providing legal counsel to a person being held for preventive detention.\n3. According to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, confession of the accused before the police cannot be used as evidence.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?",

        "year": 2023,
        "explanation": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **According to the Constitution of India, the Central Government has a duty to protect States from internal disturbances.** This is largely **correct**.  While not explicitly stated as a \"duty\" in a single article, the Constitution vests the power of maintaining internal order and security with the Union (central) government.  Articles 355 and 356 deal with the Union's responsibility to protect States against external aggression and internal disturbances, respectively.  So, this statement is largely accurate, although the phrasing as a \"duty\" might be open to interpretation.\n\n2. **The Constitution of India exempts the States from providing legal counsel to a person being held for preventive detention.** This is **correct**.  Preventive detention involves detaining someone without trial. The Constitution, particularly Article 22, provides certain safeguards for those under preventive detention, but it doesn't mandate the state's provision of legal counsel.  While many states offer legal aid, there's no constitutional obligation.\n\n3. **According to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, confession of the accused before the police cannot be used as evidence.** This is **incorrect**.  The Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) was repealed.  However, even when it was in effect, confessions made before police officers were generally admissible as evidence under certain conditions.  The main issue with POTA regarding confessions was the potential for coercion, not an outright ban on their admissibility.\n\nTherefore, only two of the statements (1 and 2) are largely correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The answer is **2**.\n"

In India, Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) play a crucial role in implementing the Nagoya Protocol at the local level. They are involved in regulating access to biological resources within their jurisdiction and ensuring benefit-sharing with local communities.\n\n**Statement 2:**  BMCs are given significant powers under India's Biological Diversity Act, 2002.  A key function is to regulate access to biological resources within their area and determine how benefits are shared. This includes the authority to levy fees for access to these resources.  The fees collected are meant to benefit local communities and conserve biodiversity.\n\nTherefore, both statements accurately reflect the role and functions of Biodiversity Management Committees in India concerning the Nagoya Protocol.\n"

Higher the number of elective Assembly seats, higher is the value of vote of each MLA of that State.\n3. The value of vote of each MLA of Madhya Pradesh is greater than that of Kerala.\n4.

        "explanation": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**1. The members nominated to either House of Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies of States are also eligible to be included in the Electoral College.**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  The Electoral College for the Presidential election consists of elected members of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies. Nominated members are not part of the Electoral College.\n\n**2. Higher the number of elective Assembly seats, higher is the value of vote of each MLA of that State.**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  The value of a vote of an MLA is determined by a formula that considers the state's population and the number of elected members in its Legislative Assembly.  A larger number of assembly seats doesn't automatically mean a higher vote value.  The formula balances these factors.\n\n**3. The value of vote of each MLA of Madhya Pradesh is greater than that of Kerala.**\n\nThis statement is **potentially correct or incorrect**. The value of an MLA's vote depends on the formula mentioned above (population/number of elected MLAs).  Without knowing the specific population and number of elected MLAs for Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, this cannot be definitively determined.\n\n**4. The value of vote of each MLA of Puducherry is higher than that of Arunachal Pradesh because the ratio of total population to total number of elective seats in Puducherry is greater as compared to Arunachal Pradesh.**\n\nThis statement is **incorrect**.  The statement implies a direct relationship which is not accurate. While the ratio of population to elected seats influences the value of a vote, it's not the only determining factor. The formula used is more complex and involves a fixed quota that gets added to the number of seats, impacting the final value of a vote for each state. A higher ratio does *not guarantee* a higher vote value.\n\n\nTherefore, only statement 3 *might* be correct depending on the actual population and number of MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.  The rest are incorrect.  So the answer is **0 or 1**, depending on the values for statement 3.  Since the question asks how many statements are correct, and we can't definitively say statement 3 is correct, the most accurate answer is **0**.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"

Recently, all the countries of the\nUnited Nations have adopted the\nfirst-ever compact for international\nmigration, the 'Global Compact\nfor Safe, Orderly and Regular\nMigration (GCM)'.\n2. The objectives and commitments\nstated in the GCM are binding on\nthe UN member countries.\n3. The CCM addresses internal\nmigration or internally displaced\npeople also in its objectives and\ncommitments.\nHow many of the above statements are\ncorrect?",
        "option a": "Only one",

        "option d": "None",
        "subject": "environment",
        "year": 2023,
        "explanation": "None of the statements are entirely correct.  Let's break down why:\n\n* **Statement 1:** While the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) was adopted by a large majority of UN member states, it wasn't *all* of them.  A few countries chose not to endorse it.  Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n* **Statement 2:** The GCM is *non-binding*.  It's a framework for international cooperation, not a treaty with legally enforceable obligations.  This statement is false.\n\n* **Statement 3:** The GCM primarily focuses on *international* migration.  While some principles might indirectly relate to internal migration or internally displaced persons, it doesn't directly address them as its core objectives and commitments.  This statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n"

Each state has its own Home Guards Act and Rules.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Home Guards act as an auxiliary force to the police, assisting in maintaining internal security and law and order.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.

        "subject": "modern india",
        "year": 2023,
        "explanation": "Let's analyze each pair:\n\n1. **Unauthorized wearing of police or military uniforms:** This is correctly matched with the **Official Secrets Act, 1923**.  This Act deals with matters of national security, and unauthorized use of uniforms could be seen as an attempt to impersonate an official and potentially compromise security.\n\n2. **Knowingly misleading or otherwise interfering with a police officer or military officer:** This is *not* correctly matched with the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The Evidence Act deals with the admissibility of evidence in court.  Interfering with an officer would likely fall under various other laws, such as those related to obstructing justice or assault on a public servant.\n\n3. **Celebratory gunfire endangering personal safety:** This is correctly matched with the **Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019**. This act deals with the regulation of arms and ammunition, and celebratory firing is a clear violation of responsible firearm handling that endangers public safety.\n\n\nTherefore, only **two** of the pairs are correctly matched (1 and 3).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"

Israel has established diplomatic relations with several Arab states, including Egypt (1979), Jordan (1994), Morocco (2020), Bahrain (2020), and the UAE (2020).  These are commonly referred to as the Abraham Accords.\n\nStatement-II is incorrect. While Saudi Arabia has been a key player in promoting peace in the Middle East and has proposed the \"Arab Peace Initiative,\" this initiative has *not* been formally signed by Israel and the Arab League as a whole.  The initiative outlines conditions under which Arab states would normalize relations with Israel, but Israel has not formally accepted all its terms, and the full Arab League has not formally ratified a full agreement with Israel based on it.\n\nTherefore, only Statement-I is correct.\n"

        "explanation": "Green hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in decarbonizing **all three** of the listed heavy industries:\n\n* **Fertilizer plants:**  A large portion of the carbon emissions from fertilizer production comes from the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. Green hydrogen can replace natural gas as the hydrogen source in this process, significantly reducing emissions.\n\n* **Oil refineries:**  Refineries use hydrogen in various processes, such as hydrocracking and hydrotreating, to improve fuel quality and reduce sulfur content.  Replacing grey hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels) with green hydrogen directly decarbonizes these processes.\n\n* **Steel plants:**  Steelmaking is a highly carbon-intensive process.  Green hydrogen can be used in direct reduced iron (DRI) processes, replacing coke and significantly lowering CO2 emissions.  It can also be used in other steelmaking processes as a reducing agent.\n"
