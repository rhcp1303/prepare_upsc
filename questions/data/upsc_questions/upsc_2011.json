        "year": 2011,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: All three statements could contribute to high food inflation in India.\n\nStatement 1: A decrease in the area under food grain cultivation due to a shift towards commercial crops directly reduces the supply of food grains, leading to higher prices.  A 30% decrease is a significant factor.\n\nStatement 2: Changing consumption patterns due to increased incomes can lead to higher demand for certain food items, exceeding supply and thus increasing prices.  This is especially true for items considered luxury or premium foods.\n\nStatement 3: Inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the food supply chain, such as inadequate storage, transportation issues, and poor market infrastructure, can lead to significant food losses and higher prices for consumers.  These structural problems can amplify the effects of supply shortages and increased demand.\n\nTherefore, all three factors (reduced food grain production, increased demand, and supply chain constraints) can contribute to persistent and high food inflation.  The combination of these factors makes option (d) the correct answer.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Named Entities (without headings):**\n\n**Food Inflation:**  A sustained increase in the price of food products, impacting consumers' purchasing power and overall economic stability.  It's often caused by a combination of supply-side factors (production, distribution) and demand-side factors (consumer behavior, income levels).\n\n**Commercial Crops:** Crops grown primarily for sale in the market, rather than for direct consumption by the farmer or their family.  Examples include cotton, tea, coffee, and rubber.  These often command higher market prices than staple food crops.\n\n**Food Supply Chain:** The entire process involved in getting food from the farm to the consumer's table.  It encompasses production, harvesting, processing, storage, transportation, distribution, and retail.  Inefficiencies in any stage can cause price increases.\n\n**India:** A large and diverse country with a significant agricultural sector.  Food security and inflation are major concerns due to its large population and dependence on agriculture.\n\n**PDS (Public Distribution System):** A government program in India designed to provide subsidized food grains to the poor and vulnerable sections of society.  While aiming to improve food security, it faces challenges in terms of efficient distribution and reaching all intended beneficiaries.\n\n**ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services):** A centrally sponsored program in India providing healthcare and nutrition services to children under six, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  It plays a role in improving nutritional status, but doesn't directly address food inflation.\n\n**Mid-day Meal Scheme:** A school meal program in India providing nutritious lunches to primary school children.  It enhances school attendance and nutritional levels but is not directly involved in managing food prices.\n\n**Poshan Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission):** A government program in India focused on improving nutritional outcomes.  It addresses malnutrition but doesn't directly tackle food inflation.\n\n**AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana):** A sub-scheme under the PDS targeting the poorest of the poor with highly subsidized food grains.\n\n**NFSA (National Food Security Act):**  A legal framework in India providing a right to subsidized food to a significant portion of the population.  It aims to improve food security but doesn't directly control inflation.\n\n**CPI (Consumer Price Index):** A measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  Food is a major component of the CPI, and its fluctuations directly reflect food inflation.\n\n**WPI (Wholesale Price Index):**  A measure of the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output.  It can provide insights into inflationary pressures at the producer level, but it doesn't directly reflect consumer prices.\n\n**MSP (Minimum Support Price):** The minimum price guaranteed by the government to farmers for their produce.  It aims to protect farmers' income but can also influence food prices.\n\n**GVA (Gross Value Added):** A measure of the value of goods and services produced in an economy, net of the cost of intermediate inputs.  It provides a sectoral breakdown of economic activity.\n\n**GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders.  It's a broader measure of economic output than GVA.\n"

        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (d)\n* **explanation:** If the Lok Sabha fails to pass the annual Union Budget, the Council of Ministers, led by the Prime Minister, must resign.  This is because the budget is a crucial element of the government's financial plan, and its failure to pass indicates a loss of confidence in the government's ability to govern. The Union Budget, as per Article 112 of the Constitution of India, is the annual financial statement showing estimated receipts and expenditures of the government.  The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the lower house of the Indian Parliament, and its approval is essential for the budget's passage. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) is the upper house, and while it can suggest amendments, it cannot vote on the budget (a money bill). The Union Finance Minister is responsible for presenting the budget, but their resignation is not an automatic consequence of the budget's failure to pass.  Modifying and presenting the budget again is also not the direct consequence; the government's fate rests on the Lok Sabha's decision.\n"

Discharge of nutrients (eutrophication) from estuaries (where rivers meet the sea) introduces excess nitrogen and phosphorus, fueling algal growth.  Runoff from land during monsoons carries agricultural fertilizers and other pollutants into the water, further enriching it with nutrients. Upwelling brings nutrient-rich waters from deeper layers to the surface, making them available to algae.  All three factors (1, 2, and 3) contribute to the increased occurrence of HABs.\n\nEstuaries: Semi-enclosed coastal bodies of water where freshwater from rivers mixes with saltwater from the ocean. They are highly productive ecosystems but vulnerable to pollution.\n\nMonsoons: Seasonal winds that bring heavy rainfall to parts of India and other regions.  The heavy rainfall associated with monsoons can lead to increased nutrient runoff into waterways.\n\nUpwelling:  A process in the ocean where deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters rise to the surface. While vital for ocean ecosystems, it can also contribute to algal blooms by providing nutrients.\n\nHarmful Algal Blooms (HABs): Rapid increase in the population of algae or cyanobacteria in water bodies, often causing oxygen depletion (hypoxia) and producing toxins harmful to marine life and humans.\n\nEutrophication: Excessive richness of nutrients in a body of water, frequently due to runoff from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen.\n```\n"

This means that heat from the water below the frozen surface of the lake has difficulty transferring to the colder air above.  Consequently, the water at the bottom remains liquid even when the surface is frozen. The density of water being maximum at 4\u00b0C is relevant to the formation of ice on the surface, but doesn't explain why the water below remains liquid.  The temperature of the lake's surface being the same as the air temperature doesn't prevent heat loss; it only indicates an equilibrium state where heat loss is balanced by heat gain from other sources.\n\nIce: A solid state of water, characterized by its crystalline structure and poor thermal conductivity.  Its formation on the surface of a lake is a consequence of the density anomaly of water.\n\nHeat: A form of energy transferred due to temperature differences.  In this context, heat is transferred from the water to the atmosphere, but this process is slowed by the insulating properties of ice.\n\nConductor of Heat: A material that allows for the efficient transfer of heat energy.  Ice is a poor conductor, while water is a relatively better conductor.\n\nDensity:  A measure of mass per unit volume. Water's density is unusual in that it is highest at 4\u00b0C, decreasing as it cools or warms from this point. This is why ice floats.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\nexplanation:Statement 1 is correct. Micro-irrigation techniques like drip and subsurface irrigation deliver water directly to plant roots, minimizing water loss through evaporation and runoff. This efficient water use also leads to reduced fertilizer/nutrient loss as nutrients are applied directly to the plants and less leaching occurs.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Micro-irrigation is a highly efficient method but not the only irrigation method used in dryland farming. Other techniques like sprinkler irrigation, and even traditional methods adapted to the specific conditions, might also be employed.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  By delivering water precisely where it's needed, micro-irrigation reduces the overall amount of water required for irrigation. In areas facing groundwater depletion, this targeted approach can help to check the receding of the water table.\n\n\n**Short notes on keywords and named entities:**\n\n**Micro-irrigation:** A water-efficient irrigation method that delivers small amounts of water directly to plant roots, reducing water waste and improving water use efficiency.  It encompasses techniques like drip, subsurface, and other localized irrigation systems.\n\n**Dry land farming:** Farming practiced in regions with low and erratic rainfall, requiring careful water management techniques to ensure successful crop production.  Dryland farming often relies on water harvesting and efficient irrigation strategies to supplement natural rainfall.\n\n**Receding groundwater table:** The lowering of the water level in underground aquifers. Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other purposes is a major cause, leading to water scarcity and environmental problems.  Sustainable irrigation practices are crucial to address this issue.\n\n**Fertilizer/nutrient loss:** The loss of fertilizers and nutrients applied to crops due to factors like leaching (movement of nutrients into the soil profile), runoff, and volatilization (loss to the atmosphere).  Efficient irrigation methods minimize this loss, improving fertilizer use efficiency and reducing environmental pollution.\n"

They encompassed various expenditures incurred by the British government, primarily benefiting Britain rather than India.\n\n1. **Funds used to support the India Office in London:** This refers to the administrative expenses of the India Office, the British government department responsible for managing India's affairs.  The India Office's functioning, including salaries of its staff and operational costs, was entirely funded by Indian revenues.\n\n2. **Funds used to pay salaries and pensions of British personnel engaged in India:** A substantial portion of Home Charges consisted of salaries and pensions paid to British civil servants, military personnel, and other officials serving in India. These payments were sent back to Britain, representing a direct outflow of Indian wealth.\n\n3. **Funds used for waging wars outside India by the British:**  The British often used Indian revenues to finance wars fought outside India, such as those in other colonies or European conflicts. This further contributed to the drain of wealth from India.\n\nTherefore, all three options contributed to the Home Charges, making option (d) the correct answer.\n\n\nDadabhai Naoroji: A prominent Indian nationalist and economist who played a crucial role in exposing the economic exploitation of India under British rule. His work highlighted the \"drain of wealth\" theory, emphasizing how British policies systematically transferred resources from India to Britain.\n\nHome Charges:  These were payments made from India's revenue to the British government in Britain.  They covered a range of expenses, including the costs of administering India from London, salaries of British officials in India, and military expenditures.  They represent a significant aspect of the economic exploitation of India under British rule.\n\nColonial rule in India: The period of British domination over India, lasting roughly from 1757 to 1947.  This period saw significant economic, political, and social changes in India, largely shaped by British policies and interests.  Many aspects of British rule are viewed negatively due to their exploitative nature and the resulting impoverishment of much of the Indian population.  Different stages of colonialism involved different policies and methods.\n\nDeindustrialisation: The systematic decline of Indian industries during British rule.  British policies favored British manufactured goods, leading to the decline of traditional Indian industries and hindering the development of modern industries.\n\nImpoverishment of peasantry: The British land revenue system and other policies led to widespread poverty among Indian peasants.  High taxes, loss of land ownership, and unfavorable market conditions severely impacted the rural population.\n\nEmergence of intermediaries/absentee landlordism: The British introduced systems of land ownership that led to the emergence of intermediaries between the peasants and the state, often resulting in exploitation and increased poverty for the peasants.\n\n\n"

This event highlighted the importance of natural coastal defenses such as mangroves.\n\nMangroves:  Salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive in coastal intertidal zones. They are characterized by unique adaptations like pneumatophores (aerial roots) for respiration in oxygen-poor soil and viviparity (seeds germinate on the parent plant).  They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including coastal protection.  Examples of mangrove locations in India include Sundarbans (West Bengal), Bhitarkanika (Odisha), Krishna-Godavari delta (Andhra Pradesh), Pichavaram (Tamil Nadu), Gulf of Kutch (Gujarat), Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because while mangrove swamps do create a buffer zone, people often live near them and use the area.  Option (b) is incorrect as while mangroves provide resources, this is not their primary role in coastal protection. Option (c) is incorrect; the trees' height and canopy offer some protection but not as effectively as their root system in preventing erosion and wave damage.\n"

Universal Truth in Jainism refers to the ultimate reality, achieved through right knowledge, faith, and action.  Universal Faith and Universal Soul are not central tenets of the creation/maintenance of the world in Jain philosophy.\n\nUniversal Law: In Jainism, this refers to the natural laws governing the universe, including karma and reincarnation. These laws are not imposed by a deity but are inherent in the cosmic order.\n\nUniversal Truth: In Jainism, this represents the ultimate reality, achieved through self-realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.  It's the understanding of the true nature of reality, free from illusion.\n\nUniversal Faith: While Jainism is a faith, the concept of a \"universal faith\" isn't a core element in explaining the world's creation or maintenance.  Jainism focuses on individual spiritual practice.\n\nUniversal Soul: Jainism believes in the existence of multiple souls (jiva), not a single universal soul that creates or sustains the world.  The universe itself is viewed as eternal and self-existent.\n\nMahavira: The last Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) of Jainism, known for his teachings on non-violence, asceticism, and the path to liberation (moksha).

        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\nexplanation: Lowering the Bank Rate, the interest rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to commercial banks, increases liquidity in the market.  A lower Bank Rate makes borrowing cheaper for commercial banks, encouraging them to borrow more from the RBI. This increased borrowing leads to a higher money supply in the market, thus increasing liquidity.  The RBI is the central bank of India, responsible for monetary policy and maintaining financial stability. Commercial banks are financial institutions that accept deposits and provide loans to individuals and businesses.  Option (b) is incorrect because a lower Bank Rate leads to increased, not decreased, liquidity. Option (c) is incorrect because there will be a definite change in liquidity.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\n\nexplanation:The strength and persistence of westerlies are influenced by several factors.  One key factor is the distribution of land and water. The Southern Hemisphere has significantly less landmass compared to the Northern Hemisphere. This results in less frictional drag on the wind, allowing the westerlies to be stronger and more consistent. The Coriolis effect, while important in influencing wind direction, does not directly explain the greater strength of Southern Hemisphere westerlies.  The Coriolis force is related to the Earth's rotation and is slightly stronger at higher latitudes. While the difference in Coriolis force between the hemispheres is negligible in explaining the difference in westerlies strength. Therefore, statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is incorrect.\n"
