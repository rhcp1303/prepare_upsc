Lake Victoria, Lake Superior, and Lake Baikal are all freshwater lakes with significantly lower salinity levels. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of factors contributing to high salinity in inland water bodies.

This is often driven by winds and ocean currents pushing surface waters away from the coast, allowing deeper waters to rise and replace them. The upwelled waters are rich in nutrients that support phytoplankton growth, forming the base of a highly productive food web. Thermohaline circulation refers to deep ocean currents driven by density differences, downwelling is the opposite of upwelling, and gyre formation refers to large circular currents.

The lack of orographic barriers and the prevalence of a subtropical high-pressure belt in winter are more significant factors in the Thar Desert's aridity.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect because while altitude plays a role, Cherrapunji's extremely high rainfall is primarily due to the funneling effect that channels moisture-laden clouds into the Khasi Hills, leading to intense orographic upliftment.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because the leeward side of the Western Ghats experiences a rain-shadow effect, resulting in significantly less rainfall compared to the windward side.

This convergence of longitudes explains why the east-west distance across India is shorter than its north-south distance, even though both cover approximately 30 degrees of arc.

While all the options play a role in global temperature distribution, the ITCZ's seasonal shift is the primary reason why the thermal equator is typically north of the geographical equator. The ITCZ, a zone of converging trade winds, shifts northward during the Northern Hemisphere summer due to the apparent northward movement of the sun. This shift brings the warmest temperatures slightly north of the geographical equator.  The other options contribute to temperature variations but are not the primary cause of the thermal equator's northward displacement.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": " The reddish hue of a blood moon is due to the refraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.  Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light (like blue) more effectively than longer wavelengths (like red).  The red light is bent or refracted towards the moon, giving it its characteristic red appearance. While option (b) is partially correct in that blue light is scattered, it doesn't explain the red light reaching the moon. Option (a) is incorrect, as direct sunlight is blocked during a total lunar eclipse. Option (d) is partially true, but the primary reason for the red color is refraction, not just absorption.  The question requires a nuanced understanding of atmospheric optics and the interaction of light with Earth's atmosphere during a lunar eclipse.\n"

This combination of technological and logistical hurdles explains the persistent gap between reserves and actual production, and partially explains the reliance on imports.  Option (a) is incorrect because Gondwana coal fields are still far more significant than the tertiary deposits. Option (b) is incorrect because India has large proven reserves.

        "explanation": " The collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, a pivotal event in plate tectonics, is directly responsible for the dramatic uplift of the Himalayas.  The immense pressure generated by this continental-continental convergence forced the land upwards, creating one of the world's most extensive and elevated mountain ranges.  While the Deccan Traps are also related to the Indian plate's movement, their formation is primarily attributed to hotspot volcanism, a distinct process. The separation of North and South America and Australia's movement towards Asia are ongoing processes linked to broader plate tectonic movements, but not directly caused by the India-Eurasia collision in the timeframe specified.  Understanding the specific geological processes involved in mountain building, including the role of compression and uplift, is crucial for answering this question correctly.

As new oceanic crust forms at these ridges, magnetic minerals within the cooling basalt align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field.  Because the Earth's magnetic field periodically reverses its polarity, the resulting rock formations exhibit alternating bands of normal and reversed magnetic polarity.  This symmetrical pattern, mirroring the magnetic reversals recorded in rocks on both sides of the ridge, provides strong support for the idea that the seafloor is spreading outwards from the ridge.

Warm ocean waters above 27\u00b0C are essential as they provide the latent heat of condensation, fueling the cyclone's energy through the process of evaporation and condensation.  Low wind shear is crucial because strong vertical wind shear disrupts the organized structure of the cyclone, preventing its development.  Option (a) is incorrect because high wind shear is detrimental to cyclone formation. Option (c) is incorrect because the Coriolis force is minimal at the equator and high-level divergence, while helpful, isn't the primary driver. Option (d) is incorrect because a deep layer of *warm* water is needed, and the Coriolis effect is negligible at 0\u00b0 latitude.  The formation of tropical cyclones is a complex interplay of atmospheric and oceanic conditions, and understanding these conditions is crucial for predicting their formation and intensity.
