        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": " Chanhudaro, Kot Diji, and Desalpur are well-established Harappan sites, characterized by their urban planning, standardized brick sizes, and unique artifacts.  Sohgaura, on the other hand, is known for its Mauryan-era copper plate inscription, clearly placing it outside the timeframe and characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization. The presence of a Prakrit inscription in Brahmi script at Sohgaura firmly establishes its association with the later Mauryan period, distinct from the Harappan culture's script and artifacts.  Options (b), (c), and (d) represent sites with significant archaeological evidence confirming their Harappan origins.  Therefore, the only site that doesn't belong to the Harappan Civilization is Sohgaura.\n"

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": " Mahayana Buddhism significantly differs from Theravada Buddhism in its theological and philosophical approaches.  The deification of the Buddha, a central tenet of Mahayana, elevates him to a divine status, contrasting with Theravada's emphasis on the Buddha as an enlightened teacher.  The Bodhisattva path, where individuals postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is another core element.  Image worship and elaborate rituals, absent in early Buddhism, became prominent in Mahayana, signifying a shift towards a more devotional practice. While monastic life is important in both schools, Mahayana's emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal extends the concept beyond the monastic order. Thus, all four mentioned features are integral to Mahayana Buddhism's distinctive characteristics.\n"

The Chandela are renowned for their Nagara-style temples at Khajuraho, known for their intricate sculptures and towering shikharas.  Rashtrakuta architecture, while showing regional variations, often blended elements of Dravidian and Nagara styles, but not to the extent described.  The statement about Kalyana Mandapas in Vijayanagara temples is accurate; these wedding pavilions are a hallmark of their temple architecture. The Chalukya dynasty, while having a rich architectural heritage, did not prominently feature Kalyana Mandapas in their temple designs. Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "  Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka predates Akbar by several centuries, placing him firmly outside the Mughal emperor's timeframe.  Kabir's religious philosophy developed independently of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's influence; in fact, their periods overlap minimally, if at all.  Statement 3 is correct; Tansen's musical compositions included Dhrupads dedicated to Hindu deities, reflecting the syncretic nature of the Mughal court's cultural environment. Statement 4 is also correct; Akbar conferred the title \"Mian\" upon Tansen, signifying the musician's high status within the imperial court.

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": " While all four Mughal emperors patronized art and culture, the shift towards individual portraits and albums as the primary focus is specifically associated with Jahangir's reign. Although Akbar fostered a flourishing artistic environment with grand illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's personal interest in painting and his patronage of artists like Ustad Mansur led to a significant increase in the production of individual portraits, often featuring detailed depictions of flora and fauna. Humayun's reign, while important for the early development of Mughal art, did not show this specific artistic shift.  Shah Jahan's patronage was primarily focused on architecture, although he also supported painting. Therefore, Jahangir is the correct answer.\n"

Archaeological evidence suggests the worship of both male and female deities, indicating a complex religious system.

The deification of the Buddha is a central aspect, portraying him as a divine being worthy of veneration, unlike the Theravada emphasis on the Buddha as a historical figure and enlightened teacher.  The Bodhisattva path, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Buddhahood, is another key distinction. Image worship and elaborate rituals are integral to Mahayana practice, providing tangible points of devotion and spiritual engagement.  However, the statement that Mahayana rejects Nirvana is incorrect; Nirvana remains a central goal, though the path and understanding of it may differ.  Similarly, while monastic life is important, Mahayana Buddhism isn't characterized by stricter adherence to monastic rules than Theravada.

His military campaigns relied heavily on gunpowder weaponry, which was relatively new to the Indian battlefield at that time, changing the dynamics of conflict.  Secondly, Babur's Timurid background introduced Central Asian architectural elements, particularly the use of arches and domes, a style that significantly influenced Mughal architecture in subsequent reigns. While Babur established the Timurid dynasty in India (laying the foundation for the Mughal Empire),  this is more a consequence of his success than a direct feature of his arrival itself.  Further, advancements in painting techniques and patronage of Persian literary styles were more characteristic of later Mughal rulers, particularly Akbar and his successors.

While Persian artistic influences arrived with Babur and the Mughals, it's an oversimplification to say it entirely replaced existing techniques. Indian artistic traditions continued to evolve and blend with Persian styles.\n\nStatement 5 is incorrect.  While there were administrative changes, it's inaccurate to say that existing systems were entirely replaced.

Horses' remains are debated and not definitively proven in Harappan sites.\n\nStatement 5 is incorrect. The giant water reservoir is associated with Dholavira, not Rakhigarhi. Rakhigarhi is known for its size and the discovery of granaries, cemeteries, and drainage systems, but not a giant reservoir of the scale found at Dholavira.

Statement 3, while related to Jain cosmology, may not be universally accepted as a definitive interpretation of the symbolism; different schools of Jainism might have varying interpretations of the flag's symbolism.

Although Babur's architecture utilized the arch and dome, these architectural elements were already present in India, particularly in pre-existing structures influenced by Persian and other Central Asian styles.  The Timurid dynasty, from which Babur hailed, was established in Central Asia before his arrival in India.  Babur's conquests led to the establishment of the *Mughal* dynasty in India, a distinct entity. Statement 3 is partially correct but Statement 4 is more accurate and should be considered. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) accurately reflect the direct and primary impact of Babur's reign.\n"

The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), making it significantly older than the 7th century CE. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), also predating the 7th century. The Barabar Caves, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), are amongst the earliest surviving rock-cut caves in India.  The Badami caves, while impressive examples of rock-cut architecture, were constructed in the 6th century CE and are thus, within the timeframe of the question.  The Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty primarily during the 7th and 8th centuries CE.  Therefore, only the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, the caves at Badami and the Barabar Caves predate the 7th century CE.\n"
