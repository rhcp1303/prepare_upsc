Sadashiva Raya             :   Ruled during the final years of the Vijayanagara Empire\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?",

        "option_d": "1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nDeva Raya II's reign saw diplomatic contacts and likely tribute from various kings including Quilon and Sri Lanka, reflecting Vijayanagara's maritime influence.  Krishna Deva Raya, known for his administrative and building prowess, is correctly paired with the construction of a new town and a large tank near Vijayanagara. Sadashiva Raya's rule indeed marked the final years of the Vijayanagara Empire's independence, though the empire lingered on in a diminished form after the Battle of Talikota.  The Battle of Talikota, which significantly weakened Vijayanagara, occurred during the reign of Sadashiva Raya, not Deva Raya I. Therefore, option (c) is the only completely accurate combination. Options (a) and (b) incorrectly associate Deva Raya I with the Battle of Talikota, while option (d) includes this erroneous pairing.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between rulers and their associated events within a complex historical context.\n"

Finally, Paes's extended stay at Krishna Deva Raya's court provides a detailed description of the ruler and his administration.  Thus, option (d) is correct.

The question tests the examinee\u2019s knowledge of administrative structures in different early medieval Indian kingdoms and the ability to differentiate between them.

Option 4 is partially correct; the Kumbh Mela at Prayag (Allahabad) is on the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna, but the pairing is incorrect.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct because it correctly identifies the Narmada's association with a Kumbh Mela location, although it doesn't specify the exact river (Shipra).

It involved calculating the average produce and prices over ten years to determine the state's share of the harvest.  The Bazai/Ghalia-Bakiishi system, another method employed during Akbar's reign, involved dividing the produce between the peasants and the state in a fixed proportion.

Nusrat Shah's attempt to conquer the Ahom kingdom was unsuccessful. Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji's conquest of Kamata was temporary, not a permanent annexation.  The other options incorrectly associate actions with rulers who did not perform them or inaccurately represent the extent of their success.

        "explanation": "\n\nRajaraja I significantly expanded the Chola empire, culminating in the conquest of Sri Lanka.  This expansion solidified Chola dominance in the region.  The conquest itself involved a major military campaign and resulted in the capture of the Sri Lankan crown and royal insignia.  His military prowess and successful campaigns are well-documented in Chola inscriptions. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.\n\nRajendra I, the successor of Rajaraja I, continued the expansionist policy, but his most significant architectural achievement was not the Brihadeeswarar Temple, although he did patronize temple building.  The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur was primarily built during the reign of Rajaraja I, completed in 1010 CE.  While Rajendra I continued the tradition of temple construction, the Brihadeeswarar Temple is primarily associated with his father. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.\n\nRajendra I earned the title Gangaikondachola (\"Chola who conquered the Ganga\") after his successful military expedition across Kalinga to Bengal, where his armies crossed the Ganga river and defeated local kings. This title commemorates a significant military achievement and territorial expansion. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.\n\nThe Chola navy under Rajendra I achieved significant dominance in the Bay of Bengal, effectively controlling the sea routes and trade.  While other Chola rulers contributed to naval power, Rajendra I's reign is particularly associated with this significant naval achievement.  This naval supremacy is described as transforming the Bay of Bengal into a \"Chola Lake.\"  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.\n"

Jahangir did not write his autobiography in Persian; that distinction belongs to Babur, whose \"Baburnama\" is a significant historical source.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

Shah Jahan's reign witnessed the construction of the magnificent Taj Mahal, as well as the Jama Masjid in Delhi, both showcasing the pinnacle of Mughal architecture. While Aurangzeb wasn't a prolific builder compared to his predecessors, he did commission the Moti Masjid within the Agra Fort, a testament to the continuation of Mughal architectural traditions.

However, Pietra Dura, the inlay work of semi-precious stones, is not primarily associated with the Buland Darwaza; it is more characteristic of later Mughal architecture like the Taj Mahal.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Pair 1:** Abul Fazl is known for his work *Ain-i-Akbari*, a detailed administrative and social record of Akbar's reign, not the *Padmavat*. The *Padmavat* was written by Malik Muhammad Jaisi.\n\n* **Pair 3:** Tansen was a renowned musician in Akbar's court, not the originator of Qawwali. Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing an early form of Qawwali to India.\n\n* **Pair 4:**  *Kitab-i-Nauras*, a collection of songs praising Hindu deities and Muslim saints, was authored by Ibrahim Adil Shah II, not Malik Muhammad Jaisi. Jaisi is known for his *Padmavat*.\n\n* **Pair 5:** Eknath was a prominent Marathi poet and saint, not a Sufi saint.  Dadu was a Sufi saint who preached a non-sectarian path.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical record, making (a) the correct answer.  The other options include significant historical inaccuracies, designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the figures and their contributions.\n"
