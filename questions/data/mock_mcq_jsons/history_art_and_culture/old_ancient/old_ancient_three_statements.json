Statement 1 correctly points to the significant contributions to Sanskrit literature, with Kalidasa's works, particularly Abhijnanasakuntalam, achieving lasting recognition both within India and internationally.  His plays and poems represent a high point of classical Sanskrit drama and poetry. Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting the advancements in science and mathematics during the Gupta period.  Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya made significant contributions to mathematics and astronomy, and evidence suggests the decimal system's use was prevalent during this time.

The rise of Jainism and Buddhism, partly fueled by Kshatriya reaction against Brahminical dominance and the introduction of a new agricultural economy in northeastern India, challenged the existing Varna system.\n2.  The new agricultural economy in northeastern India, facilitated by iron tools, led to the growth of cities and the first use of punch-marked coins around the 5th century BC, impacting the economic status of Vaishyas.\n3.  Jainism and Buddhism's emphasis on non-violence and rejection of the Varna system, along with their condemnation of usury, appealed to Vaishyas and contributed to their widespread support of these new faiths.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are correct. The rise of Jainism and Buddhism was indeed partly a response to the socio-political tensions of the time, including the Kshatriya challenge to Brahminical authority and the transformative impact of the new agricultural economy. The introduction of iron tools revolutionized agriculture, leading to urbanization and the adoption of coinage, significantly affecting the Vaishya class. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Jainism and Buddhism did reject the rigid aspects of the Varna system and promoted non-violence, they did *not* uniformly condemn usury. The condemnation of usury was primarily a feature of some Brahminical texts and not a central tenet of Jainism or early Buddhism. The Vaishyas' support stemmed more from the socio-economic changes and the rejection of the rigid Varna hierarchy.  The question tests the ability to analyze the complex interplay of socio-religious and economic factors in the rise of new religious movements in ancient India.\n"

These inscriptions, strategically placed along major roadways, serve as crucial primary sources for understanding Ashoka's reign, his policies, and the geographical extent of his empire.  Statement 2 accurately describes the impact of the Kalinga War.  The Kalinga War marked a turning point in Ashoka\u2019s reign, leading him to abandon military conquest and embrace the propagation of Dhamma (righteousness) as a means of expanding his influence.  This shift towards non-violent methods is a significant aspect of his legacy. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Ashoka's Dhamma, while influenced by Buddhist principles, was not a strictly sectarian Buddhist faith.  It encompassed broader moral and ethical principles applicable to all, regardless of their religious affiliations.  He adopted a policy of religious tolerance, making donations to both Buddhist and non-Buddhist religious groups.  He did not actively suppress non-Buddhist practices.\n"

The brick temples of Bhitargaon, Bhitari, and Deogarh are prime examples.\n\nStatement 3 correctly links the Nalanda University's early brick structures to the Gupta period, highlighting the era's dedication to Buddhist learning and the university's importance as a major center of intellectual activity. The construction of Nalanda during this period underscores the Gupta rulers' commitment to education and scholarship.\n"

This scarcity of tin, a key component in bronze, restricted bronze production compared to regions with more abundant tin resources.  India's limited bronze age is a direct consequence of this scarcity.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct.

The Chalukyas of Badami, ruling from Vatapi (modern Badami), were a local Kannarese dynasty that rose to prominence in the Western Deccan.\n3. The Pallavas, whose capital was Kanchi (modern Kanchipuram), primarily granted land to Jainas, while the Kadambas favored Brahmanical grants.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

The Vakatakas played a crucial role in transmitting Brahmanical ideas and social institutions to South India, evidenced by their numerous copper-plate land grants to Brahmins.  They actively championed Brahmanical religion and performed Vedic sacrifices.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Chalukyas of Badami were indeed a powerful dynasty originating in the Western Deccan, establishing their capital at Vatapi. While they claimed noble ancestry, their origins seem rooted in the local Kannarese population, who were elevated to the ruling varna under Brahmanical influence.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Pallavas, while performing Vedic sacrifices, predominantly made land grants to Brahmins, exempting these lands from taxes and forced labor.  The Kadambas, though also making grants to Jainas, more significantly favored Brahmins.  This reversal of the roles of Pallavas and Kadambas in land grants makes this statement incorrect.\n"

Statement 1 is correct because the style demonstrably combines Indian artistic motifs (such as the portrayal of Buddha's features) with Central Asian and Hellenistic influences (evident in the scale, drapery, and stylistic representation of the Buddha's figure). Statement 2 is accurate; the Gandhara school is credited with producing the earliest known Buddhist sculptures, notably depicting the Buddha in human form. This was a significant departure from earlier aniconic representations in the Buddhist tradition and a crucial development in the evolution of Buddhist iconography. Statement 3 is also true; the subject matter of Gandhara art extensively featured scenes from the Buddha's life (e.g., birth, enlightenment, parinirvana) and Jataka tales, stories of the Buddha's past lives, often incorporating Greco-Roman artistic elements such as realistic drapery folds and anatomical details.  These elements demonstrate a cultural exchange and adaptation of artistic styles.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.\n"

While economic challenges existed,  the abundance of gold and its utilization in coinage significantly contributed to the perception of a golden age.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Both Samudragupta and Chandragupta II are well-known for their patronage of arts and literature.  Numismatic evidence depicts Samudragupta playing the veena, highlighting his artistic inclinations. Chandragupta II's court was renowned for its nine luminaries, or great scholars, indicating a flourishing intellectual environment.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While the Gupta period did see the creation of religious art depicting Hindu deities,  examples of purely secular art from this period are relatively scarce compared to the religious works.

Astronomy in ancient India flourished due to the association of planets with deities, leading to close observation of celestial movements for agricultural purposes.\n2. The ancient Indians developed the decimal system and the concept of zero, which were later adopted by the Arabs and spread to the West.\n3.

Statement 1 accurately describes the impetus behind the development of astronomy; the association of celestial bodies with deities led to intense observation of planetary movements, which proved crucial for understanding seasonal changes and agricultural practices. This close relationship between religion and scientific inquiry was a defining feature of ancient Indian astronomy. Statement 2 is also correct; the decimal system and the concept of zero are among the most significant contributions of ancient Indian mathematics.  These innovations, initially used in India, were adopted by the Arabs and subsequently spread to the West, profoundly impacting the development of mathematics globally. Statement 3 is incorrect; while ancient Indian mathematics did have practical applications, such as those mentioned in Apastamba's geometry, it also made substantial theoretical advancements.  The work of mathematicians like Aryabhata and Brahmagupta demonstrates a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and principles beyond mere practical applications.  The contributions to algebra, trigonometry, and number systems show a theoretical depth often overlooked, highlighting the sophisticated nature of ancient Indian mathematics.\n"

Ancient Indians had some understanding of navigation and shipbuilding, but the lack of significant maritime threats and the location of major political powers away from the coast resulted in limited focus on naval development.\n3.

Statement 1 is accurate; ancient Indian texts, including epics and Puranas, provide detailed descriptions of Indian geography, including rivers, mountains, forests, and important places of pilgrimage.  However, their knowledge of regions outside India was more limited, reflecting the geographical constraints on exploration and information exchange. Statement 2 is also correct; ancient India did possess some understanding of navigation and shipbuilding, as evidenced by trade with other regions. However, the absence of major maritime threats and the inland location of most significant political centers resulted in a relatively less developed emphasis on naval power compared to some other ancient civilizations. Statement 3 is partially true; while ancient Indian geographical knowledge was largely descriptive, it's inaccurate to state it entirely lacked scientific methodologies or quantitative measurements.  Some texts and inscriptions do contain rudimentary attempts at measurement and systematic description, although these were not as developed as the more sophisticated quantitative approaches found in some Greek geographical works.  Therefore, while the scientific aspect was less advanced than the Greek approach, it's not entirely absent.  The statement overstates the absence of any quantitative or scientific approach.\n"
