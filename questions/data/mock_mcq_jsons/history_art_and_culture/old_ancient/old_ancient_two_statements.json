Their value lies in their detailed depiction of everyday life, supplementing more formal historical sources.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While Jaina texts were indeed written in Prakrit and compiled around the 6th century AD at Valabhi, their scope extends far beyond just religious doctrines.  They contain significant information about the political and economic history of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the age of Mahavira.  These texts frequently mention trade and traders, providing crucial insights into the commercial activities of the period.  The claim of limited information on the political history is a misrepresentation of their actual content.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n"

The prevalence of brick temples in Uttar Pradesh, as mentioned, is a testament to this, although the quality of workmanship was high.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the continuation of Buddhist art, citing significant examples like the Sultanganj bronze Buddha and the renowned Ajanta cave paintings.  However, this statement also correctly emphasizes a crucial development: the emergence of iconographic representations of Hindu deities such as Vishnu and Shiva.  This underscores the growing prominence of Brahmanism and its impact on visual arts.  Therefore, both statements provide a balanced and accurate assessment of the artistic and architectural achievements and limitations of the Gupta period.\n"

His conquests significantly expanded the empire's geographical reach, notably in western India after defeating the Sakas.

This expansion brought significant economic benefits, particularly through access to the western sea coast and its trade routes.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While the Mauryan Empire was characterized by a highly centralized administration, the Gupta administration displayed a more decentralized nature. This was largely due to the extensive practice of land grants (given to both Brahmins and officials) which created powerful regional entities with considerable autonomy.  These land grants, while contributing to the empire's economic stability and the patronage of religious institutions, also led to the growth of feudal tendencies and weakened central control over the provinces. The increased reliance on feudatories and the lack of a strong primogeniture system for succession further contributed to this decentralization.  The Gupta administration, while still possessing a central authority, was less rigidly controlled compared to its Mauryan predecessor.\n"

The search for Buddhist scriptures highlights the significance of India as a center of Buddhist learning.\n\nStatement 2 correctly outlines the spread of Indian culture to Southeast Asia.  While Buddhism played a role, Brahmanical cults were more influential in many parts of Southeast Asia.  The establishment of early Indian settlements in Java and Sumatra, and the subsequent rise of powerful kingdoms like Srivijaya, demonstrate the lasting impact of Indian culture. The blending of Indian and local traditions resulted in unique cultural forms, showcasing a complex interaction and exchange of ideas. Therefore, option (c) is correct, as both statements accurately reflect the significant role of religious and trade networks in disseminating Indian culture to different parts of Asia.\n"

The Vakataka dynasty, succeeding the Salavahanas in the regions of northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha (present-day Berar), is well-documented through numerous copper-plate inscriptions. These land grants, predominantly bestowed upon Brahmanas, highlight the dynasty's strong association with Brahmanical religion and their patronage of Vedic sacrifices.  This practice showcases their power and influence within the region.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Chalukyas of Badami, a significant power in the Deccan and South India, meticulously crafted their lineage to bolster their authority. Their claims of descent from Brahman, Manu, or the Moon were primarily symbolic, serving to establish legitimacy and bolster their social standing within the existing Brahmanical hierarchy.  While their actual origins might have been rooted in local Kannada populations, the adoption of such high-status ancestry was a crucial political strategy. The assertion of a prestigious lineage was a common practice among many early kingdoms aiming to consolidate power and gain acceptance among the populace.\n"

The empire's size and the diversity of the regions it encompassed facilitated cultural exchange and the spread of various cultural elements.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Archaeological evidence strongly supports the assertion of significant advancements in building and pottery techniques during the Saka-Kushan period. The use of burnt bricks, tiles, and brick wells indicates a shift towards more sophisticated construction methods.  The prevalent red ware pottery, characterized by both plain and polished surfaces and medium-to-fine fabric, shows similarities with pottery from contemporaneous Kushan sites in Central Asia. This suggests a cultural exchange and the influence of Central Asian traditions on Indian craftsmanship.  The presence of similar pottery across a wide geographic area further supports the idea of widespread cultural contact and interaction.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is historically supported. While the exact numerical strength of the Gupta army remains unknown, historical accounts and archaeological evidence suggest the presence of a standing army. This force was augmented by contingents provided by feudatories, reflecting a decentralized military structure typical of the era. The shift towards cavalry and horse archery as primary military tactics is well documented, representing an evolution in Gupta military strategy.  This reflects the changing nature of warfare and the importance of mobility and ranged combat.\n\nStatement 2 is also accurate. The Gupta period saw a significant advancement in the judicial system compared to earlier eras.  The compilation of several law books during this period established a clearer distinction between civil and criminal law. Specific offenses like theft and adultery fell under criminal law, while property disputes and inheritance issues were addressed under civil law.  While varna distinctions influenced legal practices, the system demonstrated a higher degree of codification and organization than previous systems. This points to a more formalized and structured legal framework within the Gupta administration.\n"

His reliance on feudatories for military contingents, as well as his practice of granting land to both officials and religious institutions, are indicative of a feudal system. This system, while effective in maintaining control over a vast territory, also contributed to the decentralization of power within the empire.

Despite the Mauryan state's extensive control, the society did not resemble the slave societies of classical Greece or Rome.  While slavery existed, particularly in state-controlled farms, the role of slaves in the Mauryan context was largely fulfilled by the Sudras.

The rates were often differentiated based on the land's fertility and productivity, reflecting a sophisticated system of tax assessment. This system effectively tapped into the agricultural wealth of the empire, showcasing an understanding of economic principles and resource management.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Gupta period saw a relative decline in taxes on trade and commerce compared to the increasing emphasis on land revenue. This shift reflects a possible change in economic priorities, with agriculture becoming the backbone of the economy.  This change in taxation policy is indicative of the Gupta government\u2019s focus on the agricultural sector and its relative de-emphasis on trade and commerce in terms of revenue generation.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Gupta social structure, while rooted in the traditional varna system, exhibited some flexibility and unique characteristics. Statement 1 is plausible, though not definitively proven.  Historical accounts suggest that the Guptas might have belonged to the Vaishya varna, and their administrative appointments were not strictly limited to the Brahmin and Kshatriya castes. This openness to individuals from different varnas in government positions showcases a degree of social mobility and less rigid adherence to traditional social hierarchies.\n\nStatement 2 is also supported by evidence. The Gupta bureaucracy, though less elaborate than the Mauryan, displayed signs of increasing hereditary positions and the concentration of multiple offices in the hands of a single individual. This trend towards hereditary offices and the accumulation of power in fewer hands potentially weakened the central government's control and ultimately contributed to the empire's decline. Both statements illustrate notable aspects of the Gupta social and administrative structures.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe decline of the Maurya Empire was a multifaceted process involving both internal and external factors. Statement 1 is accurate. Despite Asoka's attempts to address administrative issues and alleviate oppression in the provinces through measures like the rotation of officers, the empire continued to face challenges from misrule and discontent in the outlying regions.  This ultimately weakened the empire's cohesion and control over its vast territory.  The persistence of oppressive rule despite reforms highlights the limitations of centralized control over a large empire.\n\nStatement 2 is equally valid. The diffusion of iron technology and related knowledge to areas previously under Maurya control empowered peripheral regions to establish independent kingdoms.  This diffusion of technology led to increased self-sufficiency and the capability to challenge Maurya authority.  The rise of new kingdoms like the Sungas, Kanvas, and Satavahanas illustrates this process of regional empowerment and the weakening of central control.  Both internal administrative weaknesses and the rise of independent regional powers contributed significantly to the Maurya Empire's decline and eventual collapse.\n"

The understanding and utilization of the monsoon winds around the beginning of the Christian era revolutionized sea trade in the Indian Ocean.  This knowledge allowed for faster and more direct sea routes, significantly boosting maritime commerce. Ports situated along the western and eastern coasts of India, including Broach and Sopara, benefited immensely from this development, becoming major hubs for trade with the Roman Empire and other regions. The improved navigation facilitated by the monsoon understanding contributed to the economic prosperity of these port cities and the regions connected to them.\n"

He successfully expanded the empire's territory through military campaigns and shrewd diplomatic marriages. The marriage of his daughter Prabhavati to a Vakataka prince, while seemingly a marital union, strategically gave the Guptas indirect influence and control over the Vakataka kingdom in central India. This strategic alliance provided a crucial springboard for subsequent conquests, leading to the subjugation of Malwa and Gujarat, regions previously under Saka rule for centuries.  The control of these areas, particularly the western seaboard, significantly boosted Gupta trade and prosperity.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.\n"

The loss of western India, a vital economic region, severely hampered the Gupta Empire's finances, impacting its ability to maintain a strong army and administration.  The decline in foreign trade further exacerbated the economic crisis, weakening the empire from within and contributing to its eventual disintegration. Therefore, both statements correctly identify crucial internal and external pressures that led to the fall of the Gupta Empire.\n"

While initially arriving as conquerors, the Indo-Greeks, Sakas, Parthians, and Kushans underwent a process of Indianization. They adopted aspects of Indian culture, religion (with some converting to Buddhism or Vaishnavism), and language. This cultural exchange is evident in the development of distinct artistic styles, particularly the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara and the indigenous art of Mathura, which blended Central Asian and Indian artistic traditions.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Kushan Empire's control over the Silk Route facilitated extensive trade between Central Asia, India, and the Roman Empire. This trade brought significant economic benefits to the Kushans and introduced new technologies and military practices to India.  The Kushans' advanced cavalry, horse armour, and the use of stirrups are examples of military innovations.  Furthermore, their influence is evident in Indian coinage, which adopted certain Roman styles, and the development of glassmaking techniques.  Therefore, both statements accurately portray the multifaceted influence of Central Asian contacts on various aspects of Indian society, economy, and culture.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Huna invasions, originating from Central Asia, delivered a severe blow to the Gupta Empire. Although initially resisted by Skandagupta, subsequent Gupta rulers struggled to effectively counter the Hunas' superior cavalry tactics. The Huna incursions led to the loss of significant territories, including eastern Malwa and parts of central India, weakening the Gupta's military and political power. The Huna threat represents a major external factor contributing to the empire\u2019s downfall.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Internal factors significantly undermined the Gupta Empire's stability.  The growing independence of feudatories, governors appointed by the Guptas, chipped away at central authority.  The loss of western India, including Gujarat and Malwa, was particularly damaging. This region was a vital source of revenue from trade and commerce, and its loss crippled the Gupta economy.  The combination of internal fragmentation and external pressure proved insurmountable. The decline highlights the interconnectedness of internal and external pressures in the collapse of large empires.\n"

Simultaneously, the neglect of the north-western frontier allowed for increased incursions and invasions, putting further pressure on the empire's resources and stability. Internal weakness combined with external threats contributed to its decline.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The spread of iron technology played a crucial role in the Maurya Empire's decline.  As iron technology diffused to outlying regions, it empowered local populations to establish independent kingdoms.  The rise of new powers, such as the Sungas and Satavahanas, directly challenged the Maurya Empire's dominance, leading to its eventual fragmentation and collapse.

This differs from a purely centralized system where all power resides solely with the emperor.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While the Gupta Empire had an administrative system, it was significantly less elaborate than that of the Mauryas. The Mauryan bureaucracy was known for its highly structured and complex organization with a vast network of officials and a sophisticated system of espionage and control.  The Gupta system was more streamlined, with fewer layers of bureaucracy, though still effective in managing a large empire.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE) is widely regarded as a \"Golden Age\" in Indian history, marked by notable achievements in various domains.  Literature flourished with the works of Kalidasa, while art produced masterpieces like the Ajanta paintings and bronze sculptures of the Buddha.  Scientific advancements were also made in mathematics and astronomy. However, despite these achievements, some northern Indian towns experienced economic decline during this era.  The statement accurately reflects this complex picture, highlighting both the flourishing cultural and intellectual life and the simultaneous economic challenges faced by certain regions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While the Gupta period did see the production of art and some brick temples, it wasn\u2019t characterized by a large-scale construction of grand stone temples.  The statement exaggerates the architectural achievements of the Gupta period. The architectural legacy of the Gupta period is more nuanced and less focused on monumental stone temples compared to later periods.  A focus on brick structures and the relative scarcity of large-scale stone temple construction during this period needs to be noted. The statement oversimplifies a complex historical reality.\n"

Statement 1 correctly highlights the significant role played by the Huna invasions. The Hunas, with their superior cavalry tactics and possibly the use of stirrups, proved a formidable force. Their incursions resulted in substantial territorial losses, particularly in the strategically important regions of eastern Malwa and parts of central India. This military pressure weakened the Gupta's control over their empire and contributed to its eventual decline. Statement 2 also correctly identifies the rise of independent feudatories as a crucial factor. The Gupta emperors' control over their vast empire increasingly weakened as their appointed governors and feudatories in various regions (like north Bengal and Samatata) asserted their independence. This internal fragmentation, coupled with the economic consequences of losing the lucrative western trade routes, significantly undermined the Gupta Empire's power and stability.  The loss of revenue from these routes crippled their ability to maintain a strong central authority, further accelerating their decline. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect major contributing factors to the Gupta Empire's downfall, showcasing the interplay of external pressure and internal weaknesses.\n"

Statement 1 accurately reflects this fusion:  Indian artistic traditions, with their emphasis on figural representation and narrative, combined with the Hellenistic artistic conventions of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and Central Asian styles to create a unique aesthetic. This blend is evident in the use of realistic human forms, flowing drapery, and the adoption of certain stylistic elements borrowed from classical Greek sculpture.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Gandhara school is renowned for producing the earliest known three-dimensional representations of the Buddha.  These sculptures, while retaining core Indian Buddhist iconography (such as the Buddha's serene expression and mudras), adopted the larger-than-life scale and realistic anatomical detail characteristic of Hellenistic sculpture. The depiction of the Buddha's drapery, for instance, often displays the graceful folds and flowing lines typical of Greek artistic tradition. The combination of these Indian and Hellenistic elements is a defining characteristic of the Gandhara style, marking a pivotal moment in the development of Buddhist art.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements are historically accurate reflections of the Gandhara school's artistic significance. Option (d) is also incorrect for the same reason.\n"

Ancient Indian temple architecture, particularly the Dravidian style prevalent in South India, exerted a considerable influence on temple architecture in Southeast Asia.  The stylistic similarities between South Indian temples and those found in countries like Cambodia (Angkor Wat) and Indonesia (Borobudur) are undeniable. These similarities include the use of similar building materials (stone), the adoption of similar structural elements (pyramidal towers, intricate carvings), and the incorporation of similar decorative motifs (floral patterns, mythical creatures).  The dissemination of architectural knowledge and techniques likely occurred through trade routes, cultural exchange, and the migration of artisans and architects. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Kailasanatha temple is indeed a remarkable example of Dravidian architecture, it is located in Kanchipuram, not Mount Abu.

The reign saw a remarkable flourishing of Sanskrit literature, with renowned authors like Kalidasa producing masterpieces that continue to be studied globally.  The Gupta period also witnessed advancements in various fields, including mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. However, characterizing the entire period as a \"golden age\" across all aspects of life is an oversimplification.  Some regions experienced economic decline during this time.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Ajanta cave paintings are a monumental achievement of Gupta-era art.  While the paintings span a broader period (1st to 7th centuries CE), the majority belong to the Gupta period. They depict scenes from the Jataka tales (stories of the Buddha's previous lives) and other Buddhist narratives, showcasing a remarkable level of artistic skill and sophistication in their lifelike depictions, vibrant colors, and masterful use of perspective.

While the Rigveda focuses primarily on hymns to deities, the Atharvaveda contains a significant number of spells, charms, and incantations intended to protect against illness, evil spirits, and other misfortunes.  It also includes material related to healing, fertility, and other practical aspects of life.  Its inclusion of magical and practical elements distinguishes it from the other Vedas and has led some scholars to suggest non-Aryan influences in its composition, although the precise origins and development remain a subject of scholarly debate.  Statement 2 is also correct. While periods of religious tension undoubtedly existed in ancient India, there is limited evidence of widespread or systematic persecution of Buddhists or Jains by the ruling powers.  Over time, Buddhism, in particular, underwent syncretic processes, incorporating certain elements of Hindu beliefs and practices. This gradual assimilation helped reduce overt conflict and fostered a degree of religious tolerance, although localized instances of friction likely occurred.

This process reflected the decentralization of power and the growing influence of regional languages and traditions.  The formation of these sub-national units is a crucial aspect of understanding the political and cultural landscape of post-Gupta India.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The post-Gupta period witnessed a significant development in regional scripts.

The statement correctly identifies the variety of pottery types, reflecting the diversity of styles and techniques prevalent during that period.  The emphasis on PGW as the most distinctive highlights its importance in characterizing the Later Vedic culture.\n\nStatement 2 also correctly reflects the limitations in urban development during the Later Vedic period.  The use of wooden ploughshares resulted in lower agricultural productivity, which limited the surplus needed to support a larger non-agricultural population in urban centers.  The statement accurately points out the limited urban growth, contrasting it with the widespread rural settlements. The term \"proto-urban sites\" accurately reflects the nascent stage of urbanization.  The connection between agricultural technology and urban development demonstrates a clear understanding of the economic factors influencing societal structures.\n"

Statement 1 accurately reflects this syncretic nature. The style synthesized elements from Indian art, particularly in its representation of Buddhist themes and iconography, with influences from Central Asian and Hellenistic (Greek) art. This is evident in the use of classical Greek techniques of sculpture and drapery, along with the incorporation of familiar Indian motifs and symbolic representations.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Gandhara style is significant for its production of the earliest known sculptural representations of the Buddha.  Before this, Buddhist art primarily relied on aniconic symbols. The Gandhara sculptures, while depicting the Buddha with Indian features (such as the ushnisha, or cranial protuberance, and elongated earlobes), adopted the Hellenistic style in their rendering of the Buddha's physique, pose, and the folds of his robes (drapery).  This fusion of styles is a key characteristic of Gandhara art and a pivotal moment in the development of Buddhist iconography.  The size and proportion of the head and body, along with the detailed rendering of the drapery, directly reflect the influence of Greco-Roman sculpture.

Statement 1 correctly highlights the importance of Sangam literature as a primary source for understanding this era.  The collection of poems and literary works produced during this period offers valuable information about the social, economic, and political aspects of early Tamil society.  The descriptions of life and customs in Sangam literature are consistent with what we know from accounts left by Greek and Roman travelers who visited the region during that time.  Archaeological discoveries also support the information contained in the Sangam texts.  Together, these sources provide a relatively comprehensive picture of the Sangam age.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While the Sangam age witnessed a degree of social stratification, the extent of caste distinctions was different from later periods.  The available evidence suggests that while there were clear inequalities between the rich and poor (as evidenced by the differing types of dwellings), the rigid caste system that would later become prominent in India was not yet fully established.  The dominance of Brahmins and the ruling class was apparent, but the sharp distinctions between different castes that characterized later periods were less defined during the Sangam age.

Literary sources from this era, such as the *Mahavastu* and *Milinda Panha*, list a far greater number of artisan occupations compared to earlier texts like the *Digha Nikaya*. This increase reflects the growth in specialization and the development of a more complex economic structure.  The rise in the number of specialized crafts indicates a significant expansion of the economy and the growing importance of urban centers as hubs of production and trade.\n\nStatement 2 is also accurate.  Archaeological evidence and literary sources confirm that India's metallurgical skills had advanced considerably during this period.  The production of high-quality iron and steel was a key element of the Indian economy.  Indian iron and steel products, including cutlery and other tools, were exported to various regions, including the ports of Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia).

Lacking their own script and language, they adopted Sanskrit and Prakrit.  Many Saka and Kushan rulers embraced Indian religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Shaivism. This cultural integration demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of these groups and the absorptive capacity of Indian society.  Their integration into the existing social fabric is a significant aspect of the period\u2019s history.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Sakas and Kushans, particularly the Kushans, introduced significant advancements in military technology.  Their superior cavalry, equipped with saddles and possibly early forms of stirrups (though the exact evidence for stirrups during this period is debated), gave them a considerable advantage in warfare.  These military innovations were adopted by Indian rulers, influencing military tactics and practices across the subcontinent.  The adoption of Central Asian military technologies showcases the impact of cultural exchange and the transmission of military innovations across geographical boundaries.

Subsequently, they extended their control over Karnataka and Andhra, thereby establishing a significant kingdom in the Deccan plateau.  This expansion shows their political and military prowess and their ability to consolidate power across a wide geographical area.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Gautamiputra Satakarni, one of the most celebrated Satavahana rulers, is remembered for his military achievements and his efforts to consolidate power.

While Skandagupta initially stemmed their advance, subsequent Gupta rulers proved less effective in countering the Hunas' superior military tactics and mobility. The Huna incursions weakened the empire's military and political structure.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Gupta Empire's decline wasn't solely attributed to external invasions; internal factors played a crucial role. The rise of ambitious feudatory rulers challenged the central authority of the Gupta emperors.  The loss of western India, a region crucial for trade and commerce, dealt a severe economic blow, depriving the Guptas of substantial revenue. This combination of internal fragmentation and economic decline weakened the empire, making it vulnerable to external threats.\n"

While land taxes increased significantly (as a percentage of agricultural output), taxes on trade and commerce appear to have decreased. This shift reflects a growing importance of land-based revenue as opposed to revenue derived from commercial activities.  Furthermore, the peasantry faced additional burdens beyond direct taxation.

This process of cultural transmission, even in the absence of direct political domination, is a crucial aspect of understanding the broader historical context.\n\nThe emergence of numerous independent and feudatory states in Bengal during the 5th and 6th centuries CE reflects a complex political landscape. The existence of distinct military camps, administrative districts, and organized systems of tax collection indicates a level of political sophistication and centralization within these individual states.  The use of land grants to Buddhist and Brahmanical institutions as a tool for expansion and consolidation of power further supports this observation.  Therefore, the statements accurately depict the cultural and political developments in eastern India during this formative period.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately points to a significant challenge in understanding the Harappan Civilization.  Despite the discovery of the Harappan script, it remains undeciphered. This lack of decipherment significantly limits our understanding of their writing system, literary achievements, and the complexities of their beliefs and ideology.  The undeciphered script is a major obstacle to fully reconstructing their intellectual and cultural life.  Attempts to decipher the script continue, but no universally accepted interpretation exists.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Harappan civilization is known for its artistic achievements, particularly its seals. These seals frequently depict animals, including the one-horned bull, which is often considered a symbol of the civilization.  The depiction of animals on seals suggests their cultural and perhaps religious importance.  The discovery of a bronze dancing girl statue is further testament to their artistic skills and sophisticated bronze-casting technology. This statue, considered a masterpiece of Harappan art, provides a glimpse into their aesthetic sensibilities and societal practices.  Therefore, both statements correctly reflect key characteristics of the Harappan Civilization.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately reflects the role of iron technology in the Aryan expansion. The introduction and widespread adoption of iron tools and weapons around 800 BCE provided a significant military advantage to the Aryans. This technological superiority facilitated their expansion eastward into the fertile Ganges basin, allowing them to overcome existing populations and establish new settlements. The increased efficiency in agriculture and warfare that iron technology provided was crucial to their success.\n\nStatement 2 also holds true.  While the Later Vedic period saw a shift towards agriculture as the primary means of livelihood, cattle-rearing continued to play a vital role in the economy. The descriptions of ploughs drawn by numerous oxen, though possibly exaggerated in some literary accounts, indicate the importance of agriculture.  The cultivation of rice and wheat became increasingly prominent, showcasing the agricultural advancements of the period.  However, the texts also reveal the continued importance of cattle, reflecting a mixed agricultural and pastoral economy.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent aspects of the Later Vedic period's economy and expansion.\n"

This economic transformation resulted in the emergence of new social classes and groups, who were not easily accommodated within the existing varna system. This created social and economic conditions that were conducive to the spread of new religious ideas.  The increase in agricultural surplus supported the growth of urban centers and new social classes.\n"

The Satavahanas' policy of granting tax-exempt villages to religious institutions, both Brahmin and Buddhist, was a significant aspect of their rule. This practice created semi-autonomous zones within their kingdom, potentially fostering both religious influence and a degree of local autonomy.  This policy had both religious and political implications.  The grants significantly impacted the social and economic landscape.\n"
