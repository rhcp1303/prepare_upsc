The Harappan civilization is renowned for its advanced urban planning, which included sophisticated drainage systems. This reflects a high level of technological and societal organization.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because, while the Harappan civilization had advanced drainage, the other statements are inaccurate. Sangam literature does contain references to material culture, Ashoka's inscriptions emphasized non-violence, and the Rigvedic Aryans domesticated horses but did not use iron tools extensively in the early period; iron's widespread use came later.  The Indus Valley Civilization did not employ horse-drawn chariots widely; evidence suggests limited use at best.\n\nOption (c) is partially correct with the second and third pairs, but the first pair is incorrect as Sangam literature, while not solely focused on material culture, demonstrably does address it.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because the fourth pair is false (Rigvedic Aryans did not use iron extensively in the early stages), and the fifth pair is also incorrect (horse-drawn chariots were not a widespread feature of Indus Valley Civilization).\n"

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe Huna invasions significantly weakened the Gupta Empire, leading to the occupation of crucial territories like Eastern Malwa and parts of Central India. The growing power of feudatory rulers, who increasingly acted independently, issuing their own land grants, further undermined the central authority of the Gupta emperors.  The Gupta emperors' attempts to maintain their gold currency by reducing the gold content ultimately failed, leading to economic instability. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 incorrectly states that reducing the gold content was successful in maintaining the gold standard; it actually accelerated the decline.  This question assesses candidates' knowledge of the factors contributing to the decline of the later Gupta Empire.  Distractors are designed to test the candidates' understanding of the complex interplay of factors that led to the empire's downfall.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Besnagar inscription, while significant for its association with Heliodorus and the early presence of Vaishnavism in India, does not detail the Kalinga War. That information is primarily found in Ashoka's Rock Edicts.  The Rummindei Pillar inscription, however, does mention Ashoka's personal name, making pair 2 correct. The Sohgaura Copper-plate is indeed the earliest known royal order concerning the preservation of food grains for times of crisis, correctly matching pair 3.  Pair 1 is incorrect due to its inaccurate association.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete and incorrect. The correct answer highlights the importance of accurately associating historical records with their specific contents and purposes.\n"

Chandragupta II's court was renowned for its patronage of arts and literature, with Kalidasa being one of the most celebrated figures of that era. Yashodharman, while not a Gupta ruler, significantly challenged the Gupta empire's dominance and temporarily conquered a vast portion of northern India.  This demonstrates the shifting power dynamics and the rise of regional kingdoms during the later Gupta period.  However, Skandagupta's efforts against the Huna invasion, while valiant, were not entirely successful in repelling them permanently. The Hunas continued to pose a threat and ultimately contributed to the decline of the Gupta Empire.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) include the inaccurate pairing of Skandagupta with a complete victory over the Huns.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nRudradaman I, a Saka ruler, is not primarily associated with Buddhism; while his inscription is in Sanskrit, his religious leanings are not explicitly documented as Buddhist.  Gondophernes, a Parthian king, is mentioned in connection with the arrival of St. Thomas, suggesting a potential link to Christianity, not Vaishnavism. Kanishka, a Kushan emperor, is undeniably a significant patron of Mahayana Buddhism, convening a council and promoting its doctrines. Vasudeva, another Kushan ruler, whose name itself is synonymous with Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu), clearly indicates his worship of Vishnu.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly link rulers to religions they did not primarily patronize or follow, demonstrating the necessity of precise knowledge of religious affiliations in ancient India to answer correctly. This question tests the ability to correctly match rulers with their religious affiliations, requiring nuanced understanding of historical figures and their patronage.\n"
