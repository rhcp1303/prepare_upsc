Statement 1 correctly identifies the *rekha-prasada* (also called *latina*) style's defining characteristic: its tall, curvilinear shikhara rising from a square base to a single point. This is a common and well-established feature found in numerous temples across North India. Statement 2 accurately contrasts this with the *phamsana* style, noting its broader, shorter profile and the gentler slope of its multi-slab roof culminating in a single apex. The *phamsana* design often complements the *rekha-prasada* in larger temple complexes, frequently forming mandapas (assembly halls) while the main shrine retains the *rekha-prasada* form.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate and distinct descriptions of these architectural styles, making (c) the correct answer.\n"

Their use of profile faces, two-dimensional figures arranged within rectilinear compartments, and a restrained but fluid line style became influential on later painting traditions. The Nayaka period (16th-18th centuries CE) paintings, for example, show a clear stylistic debt to the Vijayanagara school, demonstrating the continuity and evolution of painting styles in South India. The established conventions of Vijayanagara continued to shape artistic expression.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Mathura school of sculpture, a prominent centre of artistic production in northern India, initially reflected influences from the Mauryan period. However, over time, it evolved its own unique style. By the 2nd century CE, Mathura sculptures became known for their rounder, more fleshy figures, reflecting a shift towards a more naturalistic and sensual representation of the human form.  This contrasts with the earlier, more stylized forms seen in Mauryan art. The evolution of style reflects changing artistic preferences and the incorporation of new influences.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Sarnath school of sculpture, another important centre of artistic activity, developed alongside the Mathura school. However, it exhibited a distinct aesthetic preference. Unlike the Mathura school's emphasis on elaborate drapery folds in Buddha images, the Sarnath school often favored a simpler, less ornate treatment of drapery. This resulted in a more streamlined and elegant appearance in their Buddha sculptures. This stylistic difference highlights the diversity of artistic expression within the same geographical region and time period. The simpler drapery reflects a different artistic sensibility.\n"

This assimilation demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of religious practices in ancient India. The syncretic nature of religious practices is evident in the integration of Yaksha worship.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While stupas and viharas were indeed crucial architectural components of Buddhist monastic establishments, they were not the *sole* architectural expression of Buddhist religious practices.  Ancient India also saw the construction of chaityas (prayer halls), rock-cut caves, and other structures dedicated to Buddhist practices. The statement is an oversimplification of the range of architectural forms associated with Buddhism.  Many other types of buildings and structures were used for Buddhist purposes.

While Hoysala temples are renowned for their stellate plan (star-shaped) and incredibly detailed carvings, they were predominantly constructed using soapstone (a relatively soft stone), not granite.  The softness of the soapstone allowed for the exquisite level of detail in their sculptures, especially noticeable in the intricate jewelry depicted on the deities. Granite, being a harder material, would have limited the artisans' ability to achieve this level of fine detail. The use of soapstone is a crucial characteristic distinguishing Hoysala architecture.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style is a prime example of cultural synthesis.  It demonstrably integrated established Dravidian temple architectural principles with elements borrowed from the contemporaneous Islamic sultanates. This fusion is visible not only in structural aspects but also in the sculptural decorations, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the Vijayanagara empire and its interactions with different cultures. The eclectic ruins of Vijayanagara showcase this fascinating blend of architectural traditions.\n"

The characteristic deul (shikhara) in Odisha temples exhibits a distinctive profile: it maintains a near-vertical ascent until close to its apex, then abruptly curves inwards. This creates a visually striking silhouette that sets Odia temple architecture apart. This feature is a cornerstone of Odisha's architectural identity and distinguishes it from other Nagara-style temples in North India.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Konark Sun Temple, a magnificent structure built around 1240 CE, boasted a colossal shikhara estimated to have been 70 meters tall.  However, due to its immense weight and possibly structural weaknesses, this imposing feature collapsed during the 19th century. Despite this loss, a significant part of the temple complex, particularly the jagamohana (dance pavilion), has survived, making Konark a testament to the scale and artistry of medieval Indian architecture. The jagamohana, a surviving element of the Konark complex, is noted for being one of the largest enclosed spaces in Hindu temple architecture.\n"

The use of toranas (gateways) and lintels within mihrabs (prayer niches), the incorporation of bell and chain motifs, and the depiction of trees on carved panels are all examples of this fusion.  These elements, integrated into mosques, tombs, and dargahs, demonstrate the regional adaptation of architectural styles and the creative blending of cultural influences in Gujarat. The 15th-century white marble dargah of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu of Sarkhej serves as a prime example of this provincial style's influence on subsequent Mughal tomb designs.\n"

The proximity of Kashmir to Gandhara sites resulted in a strong Gandhara influence, which blended with Gupta and post-Gupta traditions from Sarnath, Mathura, Gujarat, and Bengal.  This fusion created a unique style where the main garbhagriha and shikhara often followed the rekha-prasada or latina style, but the mandapa frequently incorporated elements of older wooden architecture, reflecting the region's own building traditions.  The integration of different styles shows the adaptability and innovation in the hill regions' architectural development.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Karkota period in Kashmir is indeed notable for its contributions to temple architecture. The Pandrethan temple, constructed during the 8th and 9th centuries CE, stands as a prime example.  Its construction on a plinth in the center of a tank is a distinctive feature.  The temple's peaked and outwardly sloping roof is a clear adaptation to the region's snowy climate, reflecting a practical approach to architecture influenced by the region's unique environmental conditions. The moderate ornamentation of the temple, deviating from the heavily carved post-Gupta aesthetics, further reflects a distinct regional style.

        "explanation": "\n\nBoth statements accurately depict significant developments in Buddhist art. Statement 1 correctly highlights the shift in stylistic preferences during the Gupta period.  The Gupta period (roughly 4th-6th centuries CE) saw a refinement of Buddhist art, particularly in bronze sculptures. This new style moved away from the earlier Kushana style (1st-3rd centuries CE), which was often more robust and less refined.  Gupta Buddhist bronzes are known for their subtle modeling, youthful and proportionate figures, and a delicate treatment of drapery, showcasing a greater emphasis on elegance and grace.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Nalanda school, a prominent center for bronze casting during the Pala dynasty (8th-12th centuries CE) in Bihar, represents a significant synthesis of artistic influences. It effectively combined the refined classical style of the Gupta period with the local traditions of Bihar and elements from central India.  This resulted in a distinctive style characterized by unique facial features, body proportions, and a highly ordered approach to composition, distinguishing Nalanda sculptures from those of other regions.  The high quality of workmanship consistently seen in Nalanda sculptures further underscores the school's importance.\n"

The mural painting tradition of Kerala, which flourished between the 16th and 18th centuries, demonstrates a unique synthesis of influences. The Kerala style selectively incorporated stylistic features from the earlier Nayaka and Vijayanagara schools but also drew significantly from local traditions like Kathakali dance-drama. This resulted in a distinct artistic language characterized by three-dimensional figures, vibrant and luminous colors, and a thematic focus on stories and episodes from Hindu mythology popular in Kerala.

The use of profile views for faces and the two-dimensional representation of figures and objects are stylistic conventions that were adopted and adapted from preceding centuries.  This stylistic consistency demonstrates the influence of established artistic practices on the development of the Vijayanagara style, indicating a deliberate continuation of established techniques.  The paintings' rectilinear compartments and relatively still, yet fluid, lines further highlight this connection to earlier artistic conventions.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The paintings at Tiruparakunram near Trichy are considered to represent an early phase of the Vijayanagara painting style.  These paintings, dating to the 14th century, provide valuable insights into the evolution of the style. The paintings at Hampi's Virupaksha temple offer a different perspective by depicting events from the kingdom's history and scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  The contrast between these two sets of paintings showcases the multifaceted nature of Vijayanagara art, demonstrating both its historical and narrative aspects.  The diversity of subject matter and the geographical spread of these paintings illustrate the significant role of art in the Vijayanagara empire.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The description of the basic components of a Hindu temple is accurate. The garbhagriha serves as the innermost sanctum housing the primary deity, the mandapa provides space for worshipers, the shikhara or vimana forms the towering superstructure, and the vahan represents the deity's mount or vehicle. These elements, though varying regionally in style and detail, are fundamental to the overall structure and symbolic meaning of Hindu temples across India.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Nagara and Dravida styles represent two major architectural traditions in Indian temple architecture. The Nagara style, dominant in North India, is distinguished by its curvilinear shikhara, which gradually curves inward to a point. The Dravida style, prevalent in South India, is characterized by its pyramidal vimana, which rises in a series of receding tiers. These distinct stylistic features reflect regional variations in architectural preferences and building techniques, contributing to the rich diversity of Indian temple architecture.  The differences in these styles are significant and easily identifiable.\n"

While both Nagarjunkonda and Goli sculptures share some similarities with Amaravati art, such as the use of three bents (tribhanga) postures and the creation of three-dimensional space, the level of animated movement and complex overlapping is less pronounced in the former two sites compared to Amaravati. The statement overstates the similarity in the dynamic quality of the sculptural styles. The statement fails to recognize the stylistic differences in the degree of dynamism between these sites.\n"

Its dedication to Shiva as Nataraja is significant, reflecting the religious context. The temple's design incorporates a double building structure, with a large mandapa designed to accommodate musical performances and dance, highlighting the importance of these art forms in religious practice.

This statement provides a clear and accurate overview of the fundamental differences and relationships between these significant architectural styles.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysala temples, despite their location in South India, are *not* exclusively classified under the *dravida* style. Their unique architectural features, including the intricate carvings and stellate (star-shaped) ground plans, distinguish them as a separate category, often referred to as *vesara*. This style, as mentioned before, is a blend of *nagara* and *dravida* elements. The statement wrongly attempts to rigidly categorize the Hoysala temples solely under the *dravida* style, disregarding their distinct hybrid characteristics.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nBoth statements accurately describe distinct sub-types within the Nagara style of temple architecture. Statement 1 correctly contrasts the Latina/Rekha-Prasada shikhara's inward-curving profile with the Phamsana style's straight incline.  The Latina style, with its tall, sharply rising tower, is a common feature of many North Indian temples, while the Phamsana style is often used for mandapas or subsidiary structures.  The description highlights a key difference in the roof structure and overall shape, crucial for differentiating these architectural styles.\n\nStatement 2 accurately identifies the Valabhi style as a rectangular building with a distinctive wagon-vaulted roof. The comparison to the curved back of Buddhist rock-cut chaitya halls aptly illustrates the historical continuity and influence on temple design. The \"wagon-vaulted\" description is a clear indicator of the architectural form, emphasizing the rounded shape of the vaulted chamber.  Understanding the Valabhi style requires recognizing its unique roof design and its connection to earlier architectural traditions. Therefore, both statements provide accurate and insightful information about the diversity within the Nagara architectural order.\n"

This fusion of Indian and Greco-Roman artistic traditions is a key defining feature of the Gandhara style.\n"

Indus Valley seals, typically square plaques made of steatite, featured a pictographic script yet to be deciphered and a variety of motifs, including animals like bulls, elephants, and tigers, as well as human figures and monsters.\n2.  Indus Valley pottery consisted mainly of fine wheel-made wares, with plain red clay pottery being more prevalent than painted ware, while polychrome pottery with geometric designs in red, black, and green was rare.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",
        "option_a": "1 only\n",
        "option_b": "2 only\n",
        "option_c": "Both 1 and 2\n",
        "option_d": "Neither 1 nor 2\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately reflects the characteristics of Indus Valley seals. The description of the seals' material (steatite), shape (square plaques), script (undeciphered pictographic), and common motifs (animals, human figures, monsters) aligns precisely with archaeological findings.  The mention of seals made from gold and ivory adds to the description's accuracy and reflects the variety of materials used.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct in its description of Indus Valley pottery. The text's description of the pottery's primary material (fine wheel-made red clay), the prevalence of plain over painted ware, and the rarity of polychrome pottery (with red, black, and green geometric designs) is consistent with established knowledge of the Indus Valley Civilization's pottery. The inclusion of knobbed and incised ware further enriches the description's accuracy.\n"
