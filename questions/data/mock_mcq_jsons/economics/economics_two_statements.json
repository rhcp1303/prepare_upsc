While CA advocates for minimum soil disturbance, the widespread availability and affordability of appropriate farm machinery for seeding and harvesting remain limited.  Traditional tillage methods are deeply ingrained, and the transition to CA requires significant investment in new technologies that are often beyond the reach of small and marginal farmers.  This lack of accessible and appropriate machinery is a major obstacle to wider CA adoption.\n\nStatement 2 correctly highlights the knowledge gap.  The successful implementation of CA hinges on the understanding and acceptance of its principles and practices by various stakeholders, including farmers, extension workers, and agricultural leaders.  Inadequate training, awareness campaigns, and effective extension services limit the knowledge dissemination about CA's potential benefits, its techniques, and its adaptation to diverse agro-climatic conditions. This lack of awareness creates resistance to change and hinders the adoption of CA practices.  Therefore, both technological limitations and knowledge deficits pose significant challenges to the wider implementation of CA in India.\n"

Village societies aggregated milk production, district unions processed and marketed the milk, and state federations handled wider distribution and marketing. This vertical integration ensured fair prices for producers while providing efficient supply chains and consistent quality for consumers.  It effectively bypassed exploitative intermediaries.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While Operation Flood significantly increased milk production, its primary focus wasn't on eliminating milk imports.  India didn't have significant milk imports to begin with, unlike the situation with food grains before the Green Revolution. Operation Flood's main goals were to boost domestic milk production, increase rural incomes, and offer affordable milk to consumers. Self-sufficiency wasn't a primary objective, but rather a consequence of the program's success.\n"

The speed and extent of the recovery in various sectors and indicators need to be thoroughly examined.  Some sectors might have experienced a V-shaped recovery, while others might have shown a different pattern. The claim requires a comprehensive review of various economic indicators, considering factors like employment, investment, and overall consumption to determine whether the recovery truly meets the criteria of a V-shaped pattern.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Seigniorage refers to the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency.  The central bank incurs costs in printing and distributing currency, but the face value of the currency issued exceeds these costs, generating a profit for the bank. This profit is a source of revenue for the government, although it's important to note that excessive seigniorage can be inflationary.  This concept is vital in understanding the relationship between monetary policy and government finance.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Interest income on reserves held by the central bank is one source of seigniorage.  Banks are required to maintain certain reserves with the central bank, and these reserves earn interest, contributing to the central bank's profits. Another source is the \"inflation tax,\" which arises when inflation erodes the real value of money held by the public.  As the value of currency decreases due to inflation, the real value of the central bank's liabilities falls, effectively increasing its seigniorage.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe seigniorage and its sources within a monetary system.\n"

However, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural intensification have placed immense pressure on these resources, leading to various environmental challenges.  The tension between economic development and environmental protection is a recurring theme in India's policy debates.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Unsustainable agricultural practices are a major contributor to land degradation in India.  Factors like deforestation, unsustainable fuelwood and fodder extraction, shifting cultivation, and improper irrigation management significantly contribute to soil erosion and loss of fertility.  Ignoring these agricultural factors in assessing land degradation would present an incomplete and inaccurate picture.\n"

This contrasts with China's economy, where manufacturing held the dominant position in terms of GDP contribution. This difference reflects the distinct stages of development and industrial structures within these economies. The shift towards services in India and Pakistan points to a potential pattern of development where service sector growth becomes prominent as economies mature. However, this transition can also bring its own set of challenges, including the need for skill development and infrastructure improvements within the service sectors."

Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, reducing investment and consumer spending, thus decreasing aggregate demand. This counteracts inflationary pressures. While rising interest rates might have some indirect effects on prices in specific sectors, they are not a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. High inflation is a signal that there is too much money chasing too few goods. To curb inflation, the RBI would use contractionary monetary policy. Selling government securities in the open market reduces the money supply. This is because when the RBI sells securities, banks buy them, thus reducing the amount of money they have available to lend, ultimately decreasing the money supply and cooling down inflationary pressures. This is a standard tool employed by central banks globally.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  If the Indian rupee is rapidly appreciating, it means its value is rising against other currencies. This makes Indian exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially harming the trade balance. In such a scenario, the RBI is more likely to intervene by *selling* foreign currency (and buying rupees) to weaken the rupee and maintain a more competitive exchange rate.  The RBI's aim is typically to maintain a stable, but not necessarily artificially strong, rupee.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Convertible bonds typically offer a *lower* interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds.

While not a direct inflation hedge like an IIB, the conversion feature offers *some* protection against inflation. If the underlying company's performance is positively correlated with inflation (e.g., in an inflationary environment, the company's earnings may increase), the value of the equity the bond can be converted into might also rise, partially offsetting the effects of inflation.  This indirect protection is a key feature that makes convertible bonds attractive to investors concerned about inflation.  The link between company performance and inflation is not guaranteed, but it provides a possible cushion against inflation's impact.\n"

Excessive government spending without sufficient revenue generation can weaken a country's currency and increase its vulnerability to external shocks.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) represent a significant inflow of foreign currency into India. This strengthens the country's foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against external shocks and reducing the vulnerability to currency crises.

Inflation and short-term interest rates are key determinants of government bond yields within a country.  Higher inflation typically leads to higher yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power.  Similarly, rising short-term interest rates tend to push up longer-term yields.  Statement 1 is incorrect.

Reports frequently place it in the top 5 or top 10, but not consistently in one specific position.  Nominal GDP rankings often place it lower.\n"

Under FEMA 1999, an Indian company receiving FDI or FPI is not required to obtain prior approval from the RBI for issuing shares.  The reporting requirements are simplified, requiring only reporting of capital inflow and share issuance to the RBI in specified formats.  Prior RBI approval is not a necessary step under the current regulatory framework.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, leading to option (a) being the most appropriate answer.

Poverty reduction is a complex process influenced by various factors, including economic growth, government policies, and social programs.  It takes time for the benefits of economic reforms to trickle down to the poorest segments of the population.  A nuanced understanding of poverty dynamics is crucial for evaluating the impact of economic policies.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Evidence suggests that India's economic reforms since 1991, while boosting overall growth, have also led to an increase in income inequality.  The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has shown an upward trend in the post-reform period. This highlights the challenge of ensuring inclusive growth, where the benefits of economic progress are shared more equitably across society.  Addressing income inequality is a major policy challenge for India.\n"

Statement 1 accurately reflects this causal relationship.\n\nStatement 2, however, presents a more nuanced scenario. Inflation-indexing wages adjusts wages based on the rate of inflation.  While this can contribute to a wage-price spiral (where rising wages lead to higher prices, which further fuels wage increases), it's not the *cause* of demand-pull inflation.  Instead, it's a *reaction* to already existing inflationary pressures.  The initial impetus for demand-pull inflation comes from the excessive demand, not from the adjustment of wages in response to that demand.

The multiplier effect plays a crucial role here; the decrease in aggregate demand outweighs the increase in savings.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A decrease in MPC (which is equivalent to an increase in MPS) reduces the slope of the AD curve in a Keynesian model with fixed prices and interest rates.  This downward swing of the AD curve implies that for any given level of output, aggregate demand is lower.  The economy moves to a new equilibrium with lower output and income. The reduction in consumption spending directly impacts aggregate demand, resulting in an excess supply. Producers respond by reducing output, further impacting income and creating a multiplier effect that drives the economy to a new, lower equilibrium.

The WPI (Wholesale Price Index) primarily measures price changes at the wholesale level for goods.  It traditionally excluded services; however, in recent years, there have been attempts to incorporate service sector prices into the WPI calculation.

High GNP per capita with persistent poverty and unemployment signifies unequal distribution of wealth and doesn't reflect genuine development.\n\nStatement 2 is also incorrect. A high saving rate is a necessary condition for investment and potential economic growth, but it's not sufficient. The capital-output ratio (the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output) plays a crucial role. A high capital-output ratio implies that a large amount of investment is needed to generate a relatively small increase in output, thus negating the effect of high savings. Other factors like technological advancements, efficient resource allocation, and institutional frameworks also influence the impact of savings on output.\n"

The banks or individuals selling the securities receive cash, which increases their deposit balances.  This increase in reserves allows banks to lend out more money, leading to a multiple expansion of the money supply through the money multiplier effect.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) is the percentage of deposits that commercial banks are required to hold with the central bank.  Reducing the CRR allows banks to retain a larger portion of their deposits as available reserves. This enables them to lend more money, thereby increasing the money supply.  A lower CRR is an expansionary monetary policy tool.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The concept of \"crowding out\" accurately describes the phenomenon where increased government borrowing to finance deficits puts upward pressure on interest rates. This happens because the government competes with private borrowers for a limited pool of savings. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for private firms, potentially leading to a reduction in their investment plans. This effect is central to debates about the impact of fiscal deficits on economic growth.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Crowding out is more pronounced when the economy is operating at or near its full capacity. In such a scenario, there are limited unutilized resources, and increased government spending leads to a direct competition for these resources. This intensifies the upward pressure on interest rates and the potential for crowding out private investment.  When resources are abundant, increased government spending can stimulate economic activity without necessarily leading to a significant crowding-out effect.\n"

If an economy has significant unutilized capacity (unemployed resources), increased government spending can boost output without necessarily causing inflationary pressure. The impact of fiscal deficits on inflation depends on the state of the economy and the interaction between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.  The presence of slack in the economy can absorb the increased demand without leading to a price increase.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Fiscal deficits are more likely to be inflationary when the economy is operating at or near its full capacity. In this scenario, increased government spending or tax cuts lead to higher aggregate demand, which cannot be fully met by increased production due to resource constraints.  This excess demand puts upward pressure on prices, leading to inflation.  The relationship between fiscal deficit and inflation is therefore context-dependent and influenced by the level of resource utilization in the economy.  The extent of inflationary pressure also depends on the monetary policy response.\n"

Revenue expenditure refers to government spending that doesn't result in the creation of assets (e.g., salaries, subsidies, interest payments). Revenue receipts are funds received by the government through taxes and other non-borrowing sources.

Proportional taxes mean that the tax rate remains constant regardless of income level. During economic booms, when GDP rises, tax revenues increase automatically, reducing disposable income and thus dampening consumption spending and inflationary pressures. Conversely, during recessions, when GDP falls, tax revenues decrease, increasing disposable income and providing some support to consumption.  This inherent responsiveness of the tax system helps moderate economic fluctuations.  Automatic stabilizers are a crucial component of macroeconomic policy.\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the effect of a balanced budget multiplier.  When the government increases spending and finances it through an equal increase in taxes, the net effect on equilibrium income is an increase equal to the increase in government spending.  This is because the initial increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand.  While the tax increase reduces disposable income and consumption, the overall effect on equilibrium income is still positive due to the multiplier effect.  The balanced budget multiplier is a significant concept in Keynesian economics illustrating how fiscal policy can stimulate economic activity.\n"

Barter systems require a \"double coincidence of wants,\" where two individuals must each possess what the other desires to trade.  This creates significant transaction costs and limits the efficiency of exchange. Money overcomes this limitation by serving as a universally accepted medium of exchange.  Any good or service can be exchanged for money, which can then be used to acquire other goods and services.  This increases efficiency and facilitates economic activity.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes money's function as a store of value.  Money allows individuals to save a portion of their income for future use.  This enables deferred consumption, providing a crucial link between present income and future spending.  However, it's important to note that the value of money as a store of value can be eroded by inflation, which decreases the purchasing power of money over time.  Therefore, the stability of money's value is a critical factor in its effectiveness as a store of value.  This understanding of money's dual roles is fundamental to macroeconomics.\n\n"

As income levels rise, individuals and businesses typically need more money to meet their increased spending needs.  Therefore, transaction demand is positively related to income.  This is a fundamental aspect of monetary theory, illustrating the direct link between economic activity and the demand for money.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but misleading in its phrasing. While the desire to hold assets quickly convertible to cash is a motive for holding money, this isn't precisely the definition of speculative demand. Speculative demand is primarily driven by the anticipation of changes in interest rates. If individuals expect interest rates to rise, they will reduce their money holdings (as the opportunity cost of holding money increases) and invest in other assets. Conversely, if they anticipate interest rates to fall, they will increase their money holdings, anticipating capital gains from holding bonds or other interest-bearing securities.  The statement incorrectly links speculative demand to the rate of return on *all* alternative investments, when it is specifically tied to interest rate expectations.  The nuance between the motivation to hold liquid assets and the specific nature of speculative demand makes this a challenging concept to grasp fully.

Inflation-indexing wages merely adjusts wages to keep pace with price increases.  It does not create excess demand in itself.  Demand-pull inflation arises from factors that increase overall demand beyond the economy's productive capacity, such as expansionary monetary or fiscal policies, increased consumer confidence, or external shocks.  Therefore, attributing demand-pull inflation solely to inflation-indexed wages is inaccurate.  Inflation-indexing wages is a response to inflation, not a cause of demand-pull inflation.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  A high savings rate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth.  A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This implies inefficiency in capital utilization, technological backwardness, or other structural bottlenecks.  Therefore, even with high savings, if the capital-output ratio remains high, the resulting increase in output may be insignificant.  This reflects a lack of productivity gains from investment.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While industrial growth is crucial for economic development, neglecting the agricultural sector can hinder overall progress.  Agricultural output constitutes a significant portion of GDP in many developing economies, including India. If industrial growth outpaces agricultural growth, it could lead to imbalances in the economy, such as rural-urban migration without sufficient job creation in urban areas, food insecurity, and inflationary pressures.  Balanced growth across sectors is essential for sustainable and inclusive economic development.  Focusing solely on industrial output might lead to skewed development, neglecting the needs of a large segment of the population dependent on agriculture.\n"

Inflation-indexing wages, while seemingly counterintuitive, can actually exacerbate inflation. If wages are automatically adjusted to reflect the current inflation rate, this increases costs for businesses, which they may pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices, creating a wage-price spiral.  Rising interest rates, on the other hand, are typically used as a *contractionary* monetary policy tool to curb inflation.  By increasing borrowing costs, higher interest rates reduce investment and consumption, thereby lowering aggregate demand and inflationary pressure.

This outflow of capital can increase the interest costs for Indian firms that have taken out External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) denominated in foreign currencies, as the repayment burden becomes higher due to currency fluctuations and increased interest rates.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation of the Indian Rupee *reduces* the currency risk associated with ECBs for Indian firms.

This highlights the need for efficient resource allocation and investments in human capital to improve productivity.  The slow growth of per capita income reflects the challenges of balancing economic growth with population dynamics.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While high rates of capital formation are essential for economic growth, they do not automatically translate into significant output increases without complementary factors like efficient resource allocation, technological advancements, and skilled labor.  Moreover, high levels of fiscal deficits are generally detrimental to long-term economic health, often leading to inflationary pressures and crowding out of private investment.  While fiscal deficits might temporarily stimulate demand, their unsustainable nature can impede sustainable economic growth.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is accurate.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) and WPI (Wholesale Price Index) are both measures of inflation, but they differ in their scope and methodology.  A significant portion of household expenditure in India, particularly for lower-income groups, is allocated to food. Therefore, the CPI gives a greater weight to food items than the WPI, which focuses on wholesale prices of goods at the producer or distributor level.  This difference reflects the reality of household consumption patterns and the impact of food price changes on the cost of living for a large segment of the population.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The WPI primarily tracks prices of goods at the wholesale level, excluding services.  In contrast, the CPI considers a broader range of goods and services consumed by households, offering a more comprehensive view of inflation's impact on the overall cost of living.  The exclusion of services from the WPI limits its ability to fully reflect the inflationary pressures experienced by consumers, especially in a service-driven economy like India\u2019s, which has seen a significant growth in the services sector in recent decades.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While high savings rates are crucial for capital formation, they do not automatically translate into significant increases in output.  Several factors can influence the effectiveness of capital formation in driving economic growth. These include the efficiency of investment allocation, technological advancements, the quality of human capital, and institutional frameworks.  Simply having high savings doesn't guarantee that these investments will be productive and lead to substantial output growth. For instance, if investments are misallocated or if the technology used is outdated, the impact on output might be minimal despite high savings.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A high capital-output ratio signifies that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This implies that the economy is not efficiently utilizing its capital resources. Several factors may contribute to a high capital-output ratio including technological inefficiencies, poor infrastructure, inadequate skills among workers and managerial shortcomings. A high capital-output ratio suggests that even with increased capital formation, the resultant increase in output might be relatively small, dampening the overall impact on economic growth.\n"

This means it takes fewer rupees to buy one unit of foreign currency.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for differences in inflation rates between countries. An increase in REER implies that the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, considering inflation.  This makes domestic exports less competitive in the global market as they become relatively more expensive for foreign buyers. Therefore, an increase in REER would signal a deterioration, not an improvement, in trade competitiveness for Indian exports.\n"

Simultaneously boosting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, further strengthening the Rupee. This is a standard policy response to a depreciating currency.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity. However, this approach usually weakens a currency because lower interest rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns.  A weaker currency can lead to increased inflation as import prices rise.

If banks are required to hold a larger proportion of their deposits as reserves, they have less available to lend, thus reducing the expansionary effect on the money supply.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The money multiplier is influenced by the extent to which people deposit their money in banks.  If more people deposit their money in banks (increased banking habit), banks have more funds available to lend, resulting in a larger money multiplier.

Food security remains a significant challenge, with issues of regional disparities, unequal distribution, and vulnerability to fluctuations in agricultural output. While overall production may be sufficient, ensuring equitable access to food for all segments of the population is an ongoing concern.  The existence of malnutrition and hunger highlights the limitations of characterizing India solely as a food-surplus economy.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. India possesses a large and relatively young population, resulting in a substantial labor supply that exceeds the available employment opportunities in many sectors. This labor surplus is a defining characteristic of the Indian economy, influencing wage levels, unemployment rates, and the overall structure of the labor market.  The presence of underemployment and disguised unemployment further underscores the labor surplus condition. This surplus significantly impacts economic policies related to employment generation, skill development, and income distribution.\n"

The presence of readily available substitutes greatly impacts price elasticity. If close substitutes exist, consumers can easily switch to alternatives when the price of a particular good rises, making demand more elastic (sensitive to price changes).

The availability of substitutes is a key factor affecting a consumer's ability to adjust consumption in response to price fluctuations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While overall economic conditions, including income growth, can influence demand, they are not primary determinants of price elasticity *for individual goods*.  Income growth affects overall demand but not the responsiveness of demand for a specific good to its own price change.

GNP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced by a nation's residents, regardless of location.  NNP accounts for the consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) during production, providing a more accurate measure of the net addition to a nation's wealth.  Subtracting depreciation from GNP gives NNP at market prices.\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the calculation of National Income (NI).  NNP at market prices includes indirect taxes (taxes on goods and services), which are not part of the income earned by factors of production. Subsidies, on the other hand, reduce the cost of production and thus increase the income accruing to the factors. Therefore, to arrive at NI (NNP at factor cost), net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies) must be subtracted from NNP at market prices.

A decrease in the mpc (meaning an increase in the marginal propensity to save) does indeed reduce the slope of the AD line, causing it to swing downwards. This is because a smaller portion of any increase in income is now spent on consumption. The resulting lower aggregate demand can lead to a lower equilibrium level of output.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 is correct.\n"

The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban and rural consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  Food items constitute a substantial portion of household expenditure, particularly for low-income households, hence they receive a larger weight in the CPI calculation. The WPI, on the other hand, measures the average change in prices of goods at the wholesale level, encompassing a broader range of goods, but with a relatively lower weight on food items compared to CPI.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI considers both CPI and WPI, the CPI has become the primary measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.  The RBI's shift towards CPI as the key inflation indicator reflects the greater relevance of consumer prices in assessing the impact of inflation on household welfare. The WPI, while still used as a supplementary indicator, does not hold the same prominence as the CPI in shaping the RBI's monetary policy decisions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  A key feature of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, is the introduction of transparent electronic auctions for the allocation of coal mines. This was a major departure from previous opaque allocation methods.  The auction process aims to ensure fairness and efficiency in the allocation of this crucial resource.  However, an exception is made for government companies which can receive allotment without going through an auction.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Act significantly altered the rules concerning captive mining.  Previously, coal blocks were allocated for captive use only, meaning companies could only use the coal for their specific projects and not sell it in the open market. The 2015 Act largely removed this restriction, allowing companies to sell the coal they have obtained through the auction process in the open market. This increased flexibility is intended to promote competition and efficiency in the coal sector.\n"

Increased inflow of foreign currency through ECBs can lead to higher demand for the Rupee, but if the inflow is not managed properly, it can also put pressure on the currency and lead to inflation and ultimately depreciation.  This is because it can increase money supply and increase import demand.  Therefore, it is not a standard practice to ease ECB conditions during a Rupee decline.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates and increased money supply, typically weakens a currency, not strengthens it.  Such a policy can increase inflation and reduce the value of the currency.  To counter Rupee depreciation, a contractionary monetary policy is generally adopted, involving higher interest rates and reduced money supply, making the currency more attractive to foreign investors.

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core aim of this strategy: to reduce reliance on imports and build a self-reliant industrial base.  The idea was to nurture domestic industries by shielding them from international competition, allowing them to grow and eventually become competitive on a global scale.  This aimed to achieve greater national economic self-reliance and reduce vulnerability to external shocks.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The import substitution policy employed protectionist measures such as high tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and quotas (limits on import quantities) to safeguard domestic industries. While this protected nascent industries, it also often led to inefficiencies due to the lack of competition. Domestic producers, facing little foreign competition, had less incentive to improve quality or efficiency.

If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will likely switch to the relatively cheaper alternative, leading to an increase in the demand for the original good.  For example, if the price of coffee rises, the demand for tea (a substitute) might increase. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between the price of a substitute and the demand for the good in question.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While an increase in consumer income generally leads to an increase in demand for normal goods (goods for which demand increases with income), this is not always the case.  Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income rises.  For example, individuals might reduce their consumption of cheaper, low-quality food items as their income increases, opting for more expensive, higher-quality alternatives.  Therefore, the relationship between consumer income and demand is dependent on the nature of the good\u2014normal or inferior.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy, typically involving raising interest rates, is often adopted by central banks to curb inflation. When the US Federal Reserve implements a tight monetary policy, it increases interest rates in the US. This makes US assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns, leading to capital outflow from emerging markets like India. Investors might withdraw their investments from Indian markets and invest them in the US to take advantage of the higher interest rates, causing capital flight.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Capital flight from emerging markets like India can lead to a higher cost of borrowing for Indian firms that have taken External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). When there's capital flight, the demand for the US dollar (or other major currencies) increases relative to the Indian rupee. This leads to depreciation of the rupee, making it more expensive for Indian firms to repay their ECBs, which are typically denominated in foreign currencies. The increased demand for foreign currency also puts upward pressure on interest rates, increasing the overall cost of borrowing for firms with existing ECBs.

Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for the potential upside from equity appreciation.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct, although the protection against inflation is indirect.

While a reduction in poverty and unemployment is a positive indicator of development, an increase in *absolute* real GNP without a corresponding rise in *per capita* real GNP suggests that the overall economic growth is not benefiting the population proportionally.  The population increase may have outpaced the economic growth, leading to a diluted per capita benefit. Economic development needs to improve the living standards of the population, and this requires a significant increase in per capita income.  Therefore, merely focusing on absolute real GNP is insufficient to evaluate economic development.\n\nStatement 2 is also incorrect. While increased industrial output surpassing agricultural output can contribute to economic development, it is not a sufficient condition.  Economic development is a multifaceted process encompassing various social, economic, and environmental factors.  A focus solely on industrial output ignores factors like income distribution, environmental sustainability, and human development indicators.  Moreover, a rise in per capita real GNP does not automatically translate into development if it's accompanied by rising inequality or environmental degradation.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately explains why the open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier.  In a closed economy, an increase in autonomous spending (like government spending or investment) leads to a larger increase in income because the entire increase in spending circulates within the economy, boosting aggregate demand repeatedly. However, in an open economy, a portion of the increased spending leaks out as imports, reducing the multiplier effect. The marginal propensity to import (the proportion of additional income spent on imports) determines the extent of this leakage.  A higher marginal propensity to import leads to a smaller multiplier.  Therefore, the open economy multiplier is always smaller than its closed economy counterpart. Statement 2 correctly describes the impact of changes in exports and imports on aggregate demand and equilibrium income. An increase in exports directly increases aggregate demand, leading to a rise in equilibrium income through the multiplier effect. Conversely, an autonomous increase in imports (not induced by changes in domestic income) reduces aggregate demand for domestically produced goods, leading to a decrease in equilibrium income.

Statement 2 correctly introduces the real exchange rate, which adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between countries.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when the overall demand for goods and services in an economy outstrips the economy's capacity to produce them. This excess demand pushes up prices across the board. Factors contributing to this include increased government spending, expansionary monetary policy, or a surge in consumer spending.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Cost-push inflation stems from increases in production costs (e.g., wages, raw materials) that are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.  While a decrease in aggregate demand *can* contribute to lower inflation (or even deflation), it is not the primary cause of cost-push inflation. Cost-push inflation is a supply-side phenomenon, whereas a decrease in aggregate demand is a demand-side phenomenon.\n"

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses both CPI and WPI data, but the CPI is increasingly viewed as the more relevant measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The NEER is an index that measures the value of a country's currency relative to a weighted average of other currencies.  An increase in the NEER indicates that the domestic currency (in this case, the Indian Rupee) has appreciated, meaning it takes more units of foreign currencies to buy one unit of the Rupee. This appreciation occurs due to factors such as increased demand for the Rupee in foreign exchange markets, or due to monetary policies aimed at strengthening the currency.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The REER adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners.  While a higher REER might *seem* to suggest improved competitiveness (because it suggests a relatively cheaper currency), it actually indicates the opposite. A rise in the REER implies that the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, considering the inflation rates. This makes exports less competitive and imports more attractive, potentially leading to a worsening trade balance.  Therefore, a lower REER is generally associated with improved trade competitiveness.  The REER provides a more accurate picture of a country's export competitiveness than the NEER alone.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Short-term foreign borrowings are vulnerable to sudden shifts in global investor sentiment.  During financial crises, foreign investors often withdraw funds rapidly from emerging markets, leading to currency depreciation and financial instability.  Reducing reliance on these types of borrowings by focusing on longer-term financing strategies strengthens a country's ability to withstand such shocks.  Diversifying funding sources and having sufficient foreign exchange reserves also contributes to this resilience.  This approach is crucial for emerging economies like India that are susceptible to capital flight during global financial turmoil.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While capital account convertibility allows for free flow of capital, it also increases vulnerability to external shocks.  During a global crisis, large capital outflows can destabilize the domestic financial system, leading to currency depreciation and economic contraction.  Full capital account convertibility can expose an economy to speculative attacks and sudden shifts in investor sentiment.  While it offers benefits in terms of integration with the global financial system, managing the risks associated with it during times of global stress is essential.  A more cautious approach, involving selective liberalization of capital flows, may be a more prudent strategy for managing vulnerability during global financial crises.  Therefore, while full convertibility has advantages, it's not a guaranteed buffer against crises.\n"

Curbing non-essential imports reduces the demand for foreign currency (in this case, primarily the US dollar), thus helping to support the Rupee.  Simultaneously, promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, further bolstering the Rupee's value.  This strategy is a common tool used by central banks and governments to manage exchange rates.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Easing conditions for ECBs might seem to help since it increases the inflow of foreign currency. However, increased ECBs can also lead to increased external debt, which carries its own risks.  Moreover, if the increased ECBs are primarily used for consumption rather than investment in productive sectors, it could worsen the current account deficit, putting further pressure on the Rupee.  Therefore, while ECBs can provide short-term support, they are not a guaranteed or sustainable solution for managing exchange rate fluctuations.  The impact of ECBs on the Rupee\u2019s value depends on various factors, including the purpose for which the borrowed funds are used, and the overall state of the global economy.  RBI often uses a more nuanced approach involving a combination of measures to manage the Rupee's exchange rate.\n"

Statement 1 accurately describes the inverse relationship between the CRR and the money multiplier.  The CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve with the central bank. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus lowering the money multiplier.  A lower CRR allows banks to lend more, potentially increasing the money supply.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Increased banking habits mean a larger portion of the public's money is held in bank accounts rather than as cash.  This increases the amount of money that banks can lend, thereby increasing the money multiplier.  The money multiplier is directly related to the amount of money held in the banking system, available for lending.  A higher proportion of money in bank accounts translates to a larger potential for money supply expansion through lending.

The aggregate money supply is a broader measure encompassing currency in circulation and various forms of money held in the banking system.  The actual impact depends on subsequent actions within the banking system and the money multiplier effect.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The withdrawal reduces the bank's reserves, limiting its ability to lend.  This affects the money multiplier, which determines the potential expansion of the money supply from an initial deposit.

However, if the bank maintains its lending rate by drawing down other reserves, the reduction in aggregate money supply could be less than Rs. 1,00,000.  The overall impact is thus contingent on the bank's subsequent lending decisions and the interplay of various factors within the banking system and economy.  The money multiplier effect signifies that the initial reduction of Rs. 1,00,000 can potentially have a larger impact on the money supply, but the precise impact is not straightforward and depends on other economic factors.\n\n"

This includes reducing quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports and lowering tariff rates.  However, this liberalization has faced criticism, as reflected in Statement 2. This statement accurately captures the concerns raised by some scholars regarding the WTO's effectiveness in promoting fair trade for developing countries.  They argue that the bulk of international trade occurs among developed nations, leaving developing countries at a disadvantage.  Furthermore, they highlight concerns about developed countries' agricultural subsidies and unequal market access, suggesting that the WTO framework hasn't always delivered on its promise of creating a level playing field for all members.\n"

Statement 1 correctly defines inclusive growth as a process that prioritizes equitable distribution of growth benefits.

This goes beyond simply increasing GDP and focuses on ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared. Statement 2 correctly points out that while rapid economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction, it is not sufficient on its own to guarantee inclusive growth.  Inclusive growth requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses issues such as the quality of employment generated, improvements in human development indicators (health, education), and the reduction of existing social and regional inequalities.  Simply achieving high GDP growth without addressing these issues could worsen existing disparities.\n"

This highlights the importance of considering the specifics of the FTA negotiations and their impact on a country's trade balance. Statement 2 is also correct in its assertion that India has actively pursued FTAs as a component of its foreign policy.  The examples of the UAE and Australia are accurate, and the ongoing negotiations with other countries demonstrate India's commitment to strengthening its trade relationships through preferential trade agreements.  The success of these FTAs, however, depends on various factors, including the terms of the agreement, the competitiveness of Indian industries, and global economic conditions.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately defines the trade balance. The trade balance, a key component of the balance of payments, simply reflects the net difference between the monetary value of a country's exports and imports of goods.  A positive trade balance (surplus) indicates that exports exceed imports, while a negative trade balance (deficit) indicates that imports exceed exports.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes the current account balance. The current account is a broader measure than the trade balance, encompassing not only the trade balance (goods) but also invisibles (services) and net unilateral transfers (like remittances, foreign aid, and gifts).  Invisibles represent the net flow of payments for services, such as tourism, transportation, and financial services. Net unilateral transfers reflect the net flow of payments made without any reciprocal transaction.  The current account balance provides a comprehensive picture of a country's overall international transactions related to goods, services, and transfers.\n"

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies one of the primary functions of money.  As a medium of exchange, money simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants inherent in barter systems.  It serves as a universally accepted means of payment, making it far more efficient for individuals and businesses to conduct economic exchanges.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While money does serve as a store of value, preserving purchasing power over time, this is not its most important function. The most crucial function of money is its role as a medium of exchange, as this underpins the efficient functioning of modern economies.  The store of value function is important, but it's secondary to the facilitating role money plays in enabling transactions.  Other assets can also serve as stores of value (e.g., gold, real estate), but they are not as efficient as money in facilitating daily transactions.\n"

Imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income, decreasing aggregate demand.\n2. Exports represent an injection into the circular flow of income, increasing aggregate demand for domestically produced goods.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 correctly explains the impact of imports on aggregate demand. When a country imports goods and services, the money spent leaves the domestic economy, reducing the overall level of spending and hence aggregate demand within the country.  This is because the expenditure is directed towards foreign producers rather than domestic ones.\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the effect of exports on aggregate demand.  When a country exports goods and services, it receives payments from abroad, increasing the overall level of income and expenditure within the domestic economy. This inflow of money boosts aggregate demand, stimulating economic activity and increasing demand for domestically produced goods. Therefore, both statements accurately describe the dual impact of foreign trade on a country's aggregate demand.\n"

A currency board arrangement implies that a country's currency is pegged to another currency or a basket of currencies at a fixed exchange rate.\n2. Dollarization involves a country abandoning its own currency and adopting another country's currency as its official currency.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately describes a currency board arrangement. A currency board is a monetary regime where a country commits to exchange its currency for another currency (or a basket of currencies) at a fixed exchange rate.  This arrangement severely restricts the ability of the central bank to control the money supply, as it must maintain sufficient reserves to back its currency at the fixed rate.  It's a highly restrictive regime aimed at achieving exchange rate stability.\n\nStatement 2 correctly defines dollarization. Dollarization occurs when a country adopts another country's currency (typically the US dollar) as its legal tender, abandoning its own national currency. This eliminates exchange rate risk and can enhance price stability, but it also relinquishes monetary policy autonomy to the country whose currency is adopted.  Both describe distinct methods of managing exchange rates, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n"
