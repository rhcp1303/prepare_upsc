This ambitious target underscores the government's commitment to boosting the agricultural sector's contribution to the national economy.\n\nStatement II is also correct. The policy recognized the detrimental effects of volatile trade policies on India's image as a reliable exporter.  The frequent use of ad-hoc measures like export bans or minimum export prices (MEP) created uncertainty in the international market.  The policy therefore advocated for a more stable and predictable trade regime with minimal government intervention, aiming to foster trust and long-term relationships with international buyers.\n\nWhile both statements are factually accurate, Statement II does not directly explain Statement I. The policy's goal of increased exports (Statement I) is a separate objective from the need for a stable trade policy (Statement II), although the latter is crucial for achieving the former.  The stable policy creates the environment necessary for export growth but is not the sole reason for the stated export targets. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.\n"

NNPfc represents the total income generated in the economy, while PDI represents the income available to households after various deductions.\n\nStatement II is correct and provides the explanation for the difference.  The difference between NNPfc and PDI arises due to several factors: indirect taxes (which accrue to the government, not households), corporate taxes (paid by corporations, not directly received by households), undistributed profits (retained by firms, not distributed as income to households), and net interest payments made by households (reducing their disposable income).  These factors reduce the amount of income actually available for household consumption and saving, thus explaining the difference between NNPfc and PDI.  Therefore, Statement II correctly explains why Statement I is true.\n"

The Indira Gandhi Canal does indeed originate from the Harike Barrage, where the Sutlej and Beas rivers meet, and it is a major irrigation project extending across the Thar Desert, making it the longest canal in India.  However,  it's crucial to note that while it's a significant project,  claiming it's the \"largest irrigation project in the world\" is debatable and requires further substantiation with concrete data comparing its scale and impact to other global projects.  The core factual accuracy of its location and purpose remains valid.\n\nStatement II is also correct. Canal irrigation's effectiveness is indeed linked to geographical factors like low-level relief, deep fertile soils, and a consistent water supply.  The northern plains of India, particularly the states mentioned, possess these characteristics, leading to the high concentration of canal irrigation systems in that region. This is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship with Statement I;  the Indira Gandhi Canal is a *part* of this larger pattern but doesn't define it.  The two statements are independently true but not causally linked. Therefore, (b) is the correct option.\n"

This outflow of capital can put downward pressure on the value of the Indian rupee.\n\nStatement II is also correct.  External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) are loans taken by Indian companies from foreign lenders.  These loans are usually denominated in foreign currencies (like USD). A devaluation of the domestic currency (INR) means that it takes more rupees to buy one unit of foreign currency.  While initially this may seem like a disadvantage, a devaluation *reduces* the rupee cost of repaying the foreign-currency denominated loan when the loan is repaid. Hence, the currency risk (the risk of exchange rate fluctuations affecting the cost of repayment) is reduced for the borrower.

The WPI primarily reflects changes in the prices of goods traded at the wholesale level. It generally does not include services. The CPI, however, includes both goods and services consumed by households.  Therefore, the CPI captures service sector price changes, while the WPI does not.\n"

This formalization aids in better monitoring, reducing informality, and improving the overall financial health of these enterprises.\n\nStatement II is also correct. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a crucial player in India's financial system. Its launch of RuPay is a domestic card payment network aimed at promoting financial inclusion by offering an alternative to internationally dominated payment systems.  While both statements relate to financial inclusion, they are distinct initiatives with different focuses. PMMY targets micro and small businesses, while RuPay focuses on providing a domestic payment system accessible to a wider population. Therefore, Statement II is not an explanation for Statement I; they are independent but related efforts to improve financial inclusion in India.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement I is correct because increases in nominal GDP and per capita real GNP can be influenced by factors other than genuine economic development.  For example, inflation can inflate nominal GDP without a corresponding improvement in living standards.  Similarly, an increase in per capita real GNP might be driven by increased inequality, leaving a large segment of the population impoverished.  True economic development requires improvements in various social indicators beyond mere economic output.\n\nStatement II is also correct. A high capital-output ratio implies that a significant amount of capital investment is needed to generate a unit of output. This can occur due to inefficiencies in the production process, technological limitations, or other bottlenecks. Even with high savings, if the capital-output ratio is high, the increase in output might be less than expected, hindering significant economic growth.  The two statements are related but not causally linked; a high capital-output ratio is one reason why high savings might not lead to proportionally high output, but it is not the only reason why nominal GDP increases might not indicate true economic development.  Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement I is correct because while an increase in GNP (Gross National Product) indicates an increase in the total value of goods and services produced within a nation's borders, it doesn't fully capture the complexities of economic development.  Economic development is a multifaceted concept encompassing factors like poverty reduction, improved living standards, human capital development, infrastructure improvement, and environmental sustainability.  A high GNP might coexist with significant poverty, inequality, or environmental degradation, thus failing to reflect true economic development.  For example, a country might experience a rise in GNP due to increased production of luxury goods consumed by a small elite, leaving the majority of the population impoverished.\n\nStatement II is also correct.  A high savings rate doesn't automatically translate to higher economic output.  The capital-output ratio, which measures the amount of capital needed to produce one unit of output, plays a crucial role. A high capital-output ratio suggests that a significant investment in capital is required to generate a relatively small increase in output. This could be due to inefficiencies in capital allocation, technological limitations, or other structural problems within the economy.  For instance, even with high savings, if the capital is invested in unproductive sectors or if there are bottlenecks in the production process (like inadequate infrastructure or skilled labor), the increase in output will be limited.  Therefore, both statements are independently correct, but Statement II does not directly explain Statement I; they are separate but related aspects of economic growth and development.\n"

PPP aims to adjust exchange rates to reflect the relative purchasing power of different currencies, thus providing a more accurate comparison of economic output across countries with varying price levels.  It directly compares the cost of a standardized basket of goods and services in different countries, accounting for price differences that nominal exchange rates might not capture.\n\nStatement II is also correct.  India's ranking is considerably higher when using PPP-adjusted figures compared to nominal GDP.  Nominal GDP uses current exchange rates, which can be volatile and influenced by various factors unrelated to the actual purchasing power of a currency. PPP adjustments provide a more realistic picture by accounting for price differences between countries.  For instance, the cost of living might be significantly lower in India than in the US, leading to a higher PPP-adjusted GDP even if the nominal GDP is lower.  The two statements are both true, but the second doesn't directly explain the first; they are related concepts in international economics.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement I is true.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index), designed to measure the cost of living for consumers, gives a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI (Wholesale Price Index). This reflects the significant portion of household budgets allocated to food in many developing economies like India.  The WPI, focused on wholesale prices, has a different weighting structure, giving less importance to food and more to industrial goods.\n\nStatement II is also true.  The CPI includes services in its price basket while the WPI primarily focuses on the prices of goods at the wholesale level. The inclusion of services in CPI is crucial as services form a large part of consumer expenditure in many countries.  The difference in the scope of goods and services covered explains why the CPI and WPI often show different inflation rates. Thus, both statements are correct, but the second statement doesn't explain the first; they are distinct characteristics of the two indices.\n"

High GNP figures can coexist with widespread poverty and unemployment, indicating that the benefits of growth aren't equitably distributed.  A nation's development encompasses social progress, improved living standards, reduced inequality, and enhanced human capital, all of which may not be reflected in GNP alone.  This is a crucial point in understanding the limitations of using solely economic indicators to measure a nation's progress.  The human development index (HDI) is a more holistic approach that considers factors beyond economic growth.\n\nStatement II is also correct. A high savings rate doesn't automatically translate into high economic growth.  The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. A high ratio suggests inefficiency in capital utilization. This might be due to several reasons, including technological backwardness, poor infrastructure, lack of skilled labor, or mismanagement.  Even with substantial savings, if capital is not efficiently employed, the resulting increase in output may be minimal.  This highlights the importance of productive investment rather than simply accumulating savings.

It accounts for the fact that the same goods and services can cost vastly different amounts in different countries due to variations in cost of living, labor costs, and other economic factors.  By comparing the cost of this standardized basket, PPP provides a more realistic comparison of economic output than nominal exchange rates alone.\n\nStatement II is also correct, but it's not a direct consequence of Statement I. While both statements relate to PPP, Statement II highlights a specific application.  India\u2019s ranking improves significantly when using PPP because PPP adjusts for the relatively lower cost of living in India compared to wealthier nations.  This means that while India's nominal GDP might place it lower in global rankings, its PPP-adjusted GDP reflects a larger share of the global economy due to the higher purchasing power of the Rupee within India.  The two statements are related but independent observations about PPP.\n"

High GNP growth could coexist with widespread unemployment, meaning that the benefits of this growth are not shared equally or utilized effectively.  Economic development encompasses factors beyond mere economic output, including social progress, poverty reduction, and equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nStatement II is also true and independent of Statement I. A high capital-output ratio signifies that a significant amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This suggests inefficiencies in capital utilization, possibly due to technological limitations, infrastructural bottlenecks, or managerial shortcomings.  Therefore, even with high savings, the resulting increase in output might be underwhelming if the capital is not efficiently used.  Both statements highlight different aspects of the complexities of economic growth and development, emphasizing that aggregate figures like GNP or savings rates aren't sufficient measures of overall progress.\n\n"

This is a fundamental principle of demand and supply.\n\nStatement II is incorrect. Complement goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complement good decreases, it makes the consumption of the original good more attractive, thus increasing the demand for the original good, not decreasing it. A decrease in the price of one complement good would typically lead to an increase in the demand for its complement. The two statements describe different relationships between goods in the market.

A monopoly firm, being the sole seller, faces a downward-sloping demand curve.  To sell more units, the monopolist must lower the price of all units.

The increased government spending boosts aggregate demand. However, in an economy with high import propensity (high import-to-GDP ratio), a significant portion of this increased demand is satisfied by increased imports.

Consequently, the increase in domestic output and income is smaller than it would be in a closed economy or an economy with a lower import-to-GDP ratio.

For foreign buyers, this makes domestically produced goods cheaper because they need less of their own currency to purchase them. Conversely, for domestic buyers, imported goods become more expensive because they require more domestic currency to buy the same amount of foreign goods.  This is a fundamental principle of international trade and exchange rates.\n\nStatement II is also correct and directly explains the macroeconomic consequence described in Statement I.  The price effect resulting from currency depreciation (cheaper domestic goods, more expensive imports) leads to an increase in net exports (exports minus imports). This increase in net exports boosts aggregate demand (total spending in the economy). Increased aggregate demand, in turn, stimulates production, leading to higher domestic output and income.  However, it's crucial to note that the response of international trade to exchange rate changes isn't instantaneous.

In an open economy, with international trade, savings can be used to finance domestic investment and also to purchase foreign assets (or conversely, foreign saving can finance domestic investment). The difference between national saving and domestic investment is reflected in the trade balance (net exports). If a country saves more than it invests domestically, the surplus funds flow abroad, leading to a trade surplus (positive net exports). Conversely, if a country invests more than it saves domestically, it borrows from abroad, resulting in a trade deficit (negative net exports).

Nominal exchange rates reflect only the market exchange rate between two currencies. However, these rates can be misleading when comparing the economic sizes of countries with substantial differences in price levels.

While increased individual saving might seem beneficial, it can have unintended negative consequences at the aggregate level.\n\nStatement II provides the correct explanation for the paradox. If everyone attempts to save a larger portion of their income, aggregate consumption demand falls. This reduction in demand leads to decreased production and lower overall income levels for the economy.  The lower income levels, in turn, reduce overall saving, potentially to the same level or even below the previous level of saving.  The attempt to save more results in less overall saving because the reduced economic activity offsets the increased saving propensity.  Therefore, Statement II perfectly explains the mechanism underlying the paradox of thrift described in Statement I.\n"

Statement II correctly identifies the overarching goal of the IPR 1956: establishing a socialist pattern of society.  The concept of the state controlling the \"commanding heights\" of the economy was a central tenet of this socialist vision, signifying public sector dominance in crucial industries.

This adjustment accounts for differences in price levels between countries, providing a more accurate comparison of economic sizes than nominal exchange rates.\n\nStatement II is also correct, but it's independent of Statement I.  While PPP calculations are used to determine the ranking of economies, the fact that India's economy is large in terms of PPP dollars is a separate observation.  The size of the Indian economy (Statement II) is a consequence of the large population and the relatively low prices of many goods and services, as compared to high-income countries.  Both statements are true, but Statement II doesn't explain Statement I; they are distinct aspects of international economics.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.\n"

This can be due to various factors, including technological inefficiencies, capacity underutilization, or structural bottlenecks in the economy.  Consequently, even with high savings (and thus high investment), the resulting increase in output might be relatively small, limiting the overall economic impact.\n\nStatement II is also correct.  Efficient administration is crucial for capital formation.  Bureaucratic hurdles, corruption, and a lack of transparency can deter investment, even if savings are abundant.  Weak governance can lead to misallocation of resources, delays in project implementation, and ultimately, a lower return on investment.\n\nHowever, the two statements are distinct and independent.  A high capital-output ratio (Statement I) explains the limited productivity of investment, while weak administration (Statement II) explains why that investment might not even be fully realized.

In a closed economy, any increase in autonomous spending (like government spending) leads to a larger multiplier effect because all the induced spending remains within the domestic economy.

While PPP theory suggests that in the long run, exchange rates should adjust to equalize the prices of identical goods in different countries (implying a real exchange rate of one), this is a theoretical ideal.  In reality, various factors such as trade barriers, transportation costs, differences in product quality and non-traded goods prevent perfect PPP from holding true consistently.  The real exchange rate often deviates from one due to these market imperfections and short-term fluctuations.\n"

This is because a portion of the increased income is spent on imports, leading to leakages from the domestic circular flow of income.  The open economy multiplier is smaller due to the marginal propensity to import (MPI), representing the fraction of additional income spent on imports. Statement II is correct.  A rise in foreign income boosts demand for the country's exports, directly increasing its export revenues.  This leads to an improvement in the trade balance (the difference between exports and imports), assuming other factors remain constant.  Higher foreign income stimulates export demand, contributing positively to the trade balance.  The two statements are independent; the size of the multiplier in an open economy does not directly explain the impact of foreign income on a country's trade balance.\n"
