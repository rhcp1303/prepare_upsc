        "explanation": " India's economic trajectory after independence has been characterized by a significant shift from agriculture to services, bypassing substantial industrial development.  Several intertwined factors contributed to this phenomenon. The complex land acquisition processes hindered the establishment of large-scale manufacturing units requiring extensive land parcels.  Simultaneously, stringent labor laws created a rigid labor market, discouraging investment in labor-intensive manufacturing industries.  Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation networks, port efficiency, and reliable power supply, added to the cost of production, making Indian goods less competitive in the global market.  These factors, coupled with the relatively easier entry into the services sector, explain the disproportionate growth of services compared to manufacturing.

Declining public investment since 1991 has starved the sector of crucial resources for infrastructure development and technological advancements.  Inadequate infrastructure, encompassing deficient transportation networks, storage facilities, and processing units, leads to post-harvest losses and limits market access for farmers.  The absence of sufficient alternative employment opportunities in non-agricultural sectors confines a large portion of the workforce to agriculture, leading to overdependence and underemployment.  The increasing casualization of agricultural labor contributes to income insecurity and vulnerability among farmers. Finally, the dominance of private trade, often characterized by exploitative practices, leaves farmers with limited bargaining power and restricts their access to fair prices for their produce. These interconnected factors significantly impede rural development and contribute to farmer distress.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. NEER reflects the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, weighted by their trade importance.  An increase in NEER means the domestic currency (in this case, the Indian Rupee) has appreciated relative to this basket, becoming stronger.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While a lower REER can improve trade competitiveness (making exports cheaper and imports more expensive), an *increase* in REER suggests a loss of competitiveness.  REER adjusts NEER for inflation differences, providing a more accurate picture of a country's real exchange rate and its impact on trade.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  If domestic inflation outpaces inflation in other countries, the NEER (nominal) will tend to depreciate (weaken) over time as the currency loses purchasing power. However, if the REER (real, inflation-adjusted) remains stable or even appreciates, it indicates that the nominal depreciation is merely offsetting the higher inflation domestically, thus creating a divergence between the two measures.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the relationship between REER and trade competitiveness.\n"

It provides a common unit for measuring the value of goods and services as a unit of account (2).  It allows for storing purchasing power over time as a store of value (3). While money can sometimes act as a hedge against inflation (4), this is not a primary or inherent function; its effectiveness depends on various factors.  Money also serves as a standard of deferred payment (5), enabling future obligations to be expressed in monetary terms.

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  A focus solely on aggregate GNP can mask imbalances within the economy.  If agricultural output (a larger portion of the economy in many developing countries) grows slowly while industrial output grows rapidly, this may not lead to broad-based development and improvements in living standards.\n\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Similarly, rapid industrial growth without corresponding growth in agriculture can create structural problems, such as food insecurity, and thus not truly indicate improved overall economic development.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Higher GNP does not automatically mean improved quality of life. If poverty and unemployment increase despite GNP growth, it suggests that the benefits of economic growth are not being shared equitably, hindering overall development.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  A trade deficit (imports exceeding exports) can be a symptom of unsustainable economic growth.  Increased imports may indicate a reliance on foreign goods, potentially weakening the domestic economy's long-term prospects and failing to improve self-sufficiency.  Therefore, higher GNP may not be indicative of improved economic development.\n"

An increase in G directly shifts the AD curve upwards, leading to an increase in equilibrium output and income.  This is a fundamental Keynesian principle.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.

Increased investment, even with a trade deficit, can be beneficial for long-term growth.\n3.  A trade deficit is always balanced by a capital account surplus.\n4.  The size of the multiplier effect is directly proportional to the ratio of imports to GDP.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements are consistent with macroeconomic theory concerning open economies?\n",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. A trade deficit itself doesn't automatically signal an ailing economy.  It's crucial to examine the reasons behind the deficit. A deficit financed by increased investment (rather than excessive consumption) can be positive for long-term growth, as investment builds the capital stock and enhances future productivity.  A deficit fueled by excessive consumption, however, is problematic.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  As mentioned above, investment-driven trade deficits can boost long-term growth by increasing the capital stock and productivity.  The key is the source of the deficit \u2013 investment is good, consumption is not.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  In an open economy, a current account deficit (which often manifests as a trade deficit) must be balanced by a capital account surplus. This reflects the fundamental accounting identity of the balance of payments \u2013 total debits must equal total credits.  Capital inflows finance the current account deficit.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The size of the multiplier effect is inversely proportional to the ratio of imports to GDP. A higher import-to-GDP ratio implies a smaller multiplier because a larger share of increased demand goes to imports, reducing the impact on domestic output.\n"

        "explanation": " The money multiplier is affected by the reserve requirements (CRR and SLR) and the public's propensity to hold deposits in banks. An increase in CRR or SLR reduces the money multiplier as banks have less money to lend. An increase in the banking habit increases the money multiplier as more money is deposited in banks, increasing the money supply. An increase in the population itself does not directly impact the money multiplier. Therefore, only an increase in the banking habit of the population is likely to increase the money multiplier.\n"

The concept of the state controlling \"commanding heights\" is central to this policy, signifying the government's dominant role in key industries.  Licensing played a crucial role in regulating industrial expansion and directing investment toward backward regions to achieve regional balance. Import substitution was a core tenet of the trade policy, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign goods through protectionist measures. Finally, the Karve Committee's recommendations were instrumental in shaping policies supporting small-scale industries, recognizing their potential for rural development and employment generation.

India's engagement in these agreements demonstrates its active participation in shaping international trade.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While India's FTAs have increased trade, the impact has been more pronounced on the import side than the export side.  This is largely attributed to India's relatively high tariffs before the agreements, leading to larger tariff reductions for India compared to its partners. This resulted in increased imports.  A consistent trade surplus, particularly in services, is not accurately reflected by the data.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  India's decision to withdraw from RCEP stemmed from concerns about increased competition from cheaper imports, particularly from China,  inadequate \"Rules of Origin\" provisions that could facilitate dumping, and the potential negative impact on the domestic dairy industry.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  India's proposal for WTO reforms prioritizes upholding the core principles of the Multilateral Trading System, addressing the Dispute Settlement System's shortcomings, safeguarding development concerns, and ensuring transparency.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe factors influencing exchange rates.  In a flexible system, market forces of supply and demand determine the exchange rate. Increased demand for exports implies greater demand for the exporting country's currency, leading to appreciation (statement 2). Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the currency and causing appreciation (statement 3). Statement 4 is incorrect because PPP theory primarily explains long-run exchange rate movements, not short-run fluctuations.  While PPP suggests exchange rates should adjust to reflect price level differences, numerous short-term factors (speculation, government intervention, etc.) significantly influence exchange rates before they reach a long-run equilibrium determined by PPP.\n"
