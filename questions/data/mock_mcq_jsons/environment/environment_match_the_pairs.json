        "explanation": "\n\nAmensalism accurately describes the relationship between Penicillium and bacteria, where one is inhibited while the other is unaffected. Predation is correctly exemplified by leopards hunting deer; one species benefits while the other is harmed. Commensalism is well-represented by the suckerfish and shark example, with the suckerfish benefiting while the shark is neither harmed nor helped.  Mutualism is appropriately illustrated by the sea anemone and hermit crab symbiosis, where both species benefit. However, the pairing of parasitism with mosquitoes is incorrect. While mosquitoes feed on blood, they are not considered parasites because they do not live on the host. A true parasite maintains a long-term relationship with its host, deriving nourishment and shelter.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched parasitism example.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nPyramids of biomass can indeed be inverted in aquatic ecosystems due to the rapid reproduction and small size of phytoplankton, making their total biomass less than that of consumers at a given time. Pyramids of energy are always upright because energy is lost at each trophic level; this is a fundamental principle of ecological energetics.  Inverted pyramids of numbers are a characteristic of tree ecosystems, where a single large tree supports numerous smaller herbivores and parasites. However, pyramids of numbers are not always upright; their shape depends on the size and abundance of organisms at each trophic level.

The nitrogen cycle involves the continuous exchange of nitrogen between the atmosphere and organisms.  The carbon cycle similarly involves the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, organisms, and hydrosphere.  In contrast, sedimentary cycles, like the phosphorus cycle, primarily have their reservoirs in the Earth's crust.  Phosphorus is released from rocks through weathering and erosion and cycles through the biosphere, ultimately returning to the sediments. Option 1 is incorrect as the reservoir for gaseous cycles is not the Earth's crust; option 3 is partially correct as the carbon cycle uses the hydrosphere as one of its reservoirs but not exclusively; and option 2 is incorrect as the sedimentary cycle's main reservoir is the Earth's crust, not the atmosphere.  Understanding the distinctions between gaseous and sedimentary nutrient cycles and their respective reservoirs is crucial for comprehending the flow of nutrients in ecosystems and the impact of human activities on these cycles.

        "explanation": "\n\nChrome tanning, a process using chromium salts to treat hides, releases hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) as a byproduct of the chemical reactions involved.  Sugarcane residue burning, a common practice in agricultural areas, is a significant source of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082).  The combustion process releases various pollutants, including SO\u2082.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect. While copper smelting does produce several air pollutants, carbon monoxide is not the primary one.  Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is a far more significant air pollutant from copper smelting due to the high sulfur content in many copper ores.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect.  While coal combustion does release nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), it is not the primary emission.  The major greenhouse gas released is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).  Other significant pollutants include sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n\nPair 5 is correct. The blast furnace process in iron and steel production uses coke (a form of carbon) as fuel. The primary gaseous byproduct of this process is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), resulting from the reduction of iron oxides.\n"

Phytoplankton, through photosynthesis, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus acting as a carbon sink.  However, the statement is somewhat misleading as it doesn't directly address global warming.  While phytoplankton help regulate atmospheric CO2 levels, their role in directly causing or exacerbating global warming is indirect.  The escape of gases into the outer stratosphere isn't a direct cause of global warming; the process is more complex and involves various atmospheric interactions. Trapping of air in polar ice caps might seem relevant, but it's not a direct contributor to global warming. Instead, the melting of these ice caps contributes to sea-level rise which is a consequence of global warming.

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (b) is the correct answer. Melting permafrost is a significant concern in regions like Siberia, where the thawing of frozen ground releases greenhouse gases. Ocean deoxygenation, the expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), is directly linked to climate change impacts on ocean ecosystems. The other pairings are inaccurate. While increased cyclone intensity is a consequence of climate change, it\u2019s not limited to the Arctic; it impacts various ocean basins globally.  Sea level rise affects numerous coastal regions, including those near Himalayan glaciers but is not exclusively limited to them. Thermal expansion of water and melting of polar ice caps are also significant contributors. A comprehensive understanding of the diverse impacts of climate change across different geographic regions is crucial for effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.  The accurate pairing of permafrost melting and ocean deoxygenation emphasizes the far-reaching consequences of climate change on diverse ecosystems.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5) primarily focused on the impacts of a 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario and pathways to limit warming to this level. While ocean acidification is a significant consequence of climate change addressed in various IPCC reports, it wasn't the *primary* focus of SR1.5.  The Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) extensively examined the contribution of land use changes and the global food system to greenhouse gas emissions, making statement 2 correct.  The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) detailed the impacts of climate change on oceans and cryosphere, but the net-zero emissions target by 2050 is a broader climate goal discussed in various IPCC assessments, not solely within SROCC. Therefore, only pair 2 is accurately matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairs that misrepresent the focal points of the specified IPCC reports.\n"

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies focus on capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from stationary sources, such as power plants, and storing them underground or in other secure locations. Low emissions technologies, such as renewable energy sources and energy-efficient appliances, aim to reduce the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of various sectors. Clean coal technologies aim to improve the efficiency of coal-fired power plants and reduce emissions, but this is not the primary mechanism of CCS. Expanding protected areas contributes to biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration but doesn't directly reduce methane emissions. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect because clean coal technology employs various methods (like scrubbers and gasification) to reduce emissions, and expanding protected areas primarily addresses biodiversity and carbon sequestration, not specifically methane reduction.\n"

Lime is used in water treatment for pH correction to stabilize water and minimize corrosion. Bleaching powder and alum are used for arsenic removal.  Sodium carbonate is one of the agents used in domestic defluorination, depending on water alkalinity and fluoride content.  Option 1 is incorrect as ozone is primarily used for disinfection, not coagulation. Aluminium sulfate is the coagulant used, causing tiny dirt particles to clump together for easier removal. Option 2 is partially correct as chlorine is the most common disinfectant, but ozone is also used as an alternative.\n"
