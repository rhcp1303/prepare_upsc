The Kasturirangan Committee, a high-level working group, proposed a less stringent approach than the Gadgil Committee, suggesting that 37% of the Western Ghats (approximately 60,000 hectares) should be declared as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA). This highlights the complexities of balancing conservation with development needs.  Failure to recall this specific figure would show an inadequate grasp of the committee's recommendations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Kasturirangan Committee did *not* propose a complete ban on hydropower projects. While it recommended restrictions on such projects, it did not advocate for a total ban. This nuanced difference highlights the importance of accurate understanding of policy recommendations.

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  Sedimentary nutrient cycles, such as the phosphorus cycle, are generally considered imperfect cycles.  This is because nutrients are often locked in sediments for extended periods, making them unavailable for immediate cycling.  The rate of nutrient replacement is significantly slower compared to gaseous cycles.  The geological processes involved in releasing nutrients from sediments are much slower than biological processes involved in gaseous cycles.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Gaseous cycles, including the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen cycles, are characterized by having their main reservoirs in the atmosphere or hydrosphere (oceans).  The movement of nutrients in these cycles involves atmospheric or aquatic phases, leading to relatively rapid cycling compared to sedimentary cycles.  This rapid cycling is essential for the continuous availability of these crucial elements for life.\n"

WTE plants in India primarily focus on processing dry waste, which, after removal of recyclable materials, can be processed into Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) for energy generation. The emphasis on dry waste is due to the challenges involved in processing wet waste in WTE plants.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  A significant hurdle for WTE plants in India is the high moisture and inert content (soil, silt) in municipal solid waste.

Exposure to elevated levels of ozone can cause a range of respiratory problems, including coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  It can also worsen existing respiratory conditions such as asthma, triggering asthma attacks in susceptible individuals.  The harmful effects of ground-level ozone are well-established in numerous epidemiological studies.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While SO\u2082 does participate in atmospheric chemical reactions involving hydroxyl radicals, its net effect is not primarily global cooling.  Instead, SO\u2082 contributes to acid rain and can form aerosols that have both warming and cooling effects on the climate, depending on various factors like altitude and aerosol type.  The statement incorrectly attributes a dominant cooling role to SO\u2082 that is not supported by current scientific understanding.  The formation of hydroxyl radicals by SO\u2082 is a complex process with multiple effects on atmospheric chemistry and climate.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides an accurate description of the effects of air pollution.\n"

While carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas, methane (CH4) possesses a much higher global warming potential (GWP) on a shorter timescale.  Over a 20-year period, methane's GWP is significantly greater than CO2's, meaning it traps substantially more heat per unit mass. Although methane's atmospheric lifetime is shorter than CO2's (around 12 years versus 50-200 years), its initial warming effect is much more intense.  This makes addressing methane emissions a crucial aspect of climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is another potent greenhouse gas with a considerably long atmospheric lifetime\u2014around 120 years. This extended lifespan allows N2O to contribute significantly to long-term warming. Its GWP is also substantially higher than that of CO2. The longevity of N2O in the atmosphere necessitates its consideration in climate models and mitigation efforts.

Second, the 10 km radius is a guideline, not a mandatory requirement.  The width of the ESZ and the regulations can vary depending on the specific protected area's ecological sensitivity and the surrounding landscape.  The Supreme Court's 2022 directive mandates a minimum 1 km ESZ, but this doesn't negate the variable nature of ESZ boundaries. Statement 2 is partially correct in that minimizing human-animal conflict and preventing forest depletion are major objectives.

Instead, it identifies Ramsar Sites where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as a result of human activities, threatening the wetland's ecological integrity.  These changes could be due to various factors, such as pollution, habitat destruction, or unsustainable resource use.  Statement 2 correctly describes the purpose of the Montreux Record. It serves as a mechanism to highlight wetlands facing significant threats and to encourage international cooperation in addressing these challenges.  Inclusion in the Montreux Record does not automatically impose any specific conservation measures, but it serves as a call for action and a signal to the international community of the wetland's vulnerability.

Photosynthesis by plants and phytoplankton is the main process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted into organic matter. Respiration in plants, animals, and decomposers, along with the decomposition of organic matter, releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, completing the cycle.  This continuous exchange maintains the balance of carbon in the atmosphere.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of carbon dioxide from deep within the Earth's interior into the atmosphere. Although this is a slower process compared to the short-term carbon cycle described in Statement 1, volcanic activity contributes significantly to the long-term carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over geological timescales.\n"

Certain prokaryotic organisms, including free-living soil bacteria (e.g., Azotobacter, Clostridium) and symbiotic bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium in legume root nodules), possess the enzyme nitrogenase, which enables them to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3).  Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) also play a significant role in nitrogen fixation, particularly in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Lightning provides the energy needed to break the strong triple bond in atmospheric nitrogen (N2), converting it into nitrogen oxides (NOx). These nitrogen oxides are then dissolved in rainwater and transported to the soil, where they are further converted into ammonia (NH3) and nitrates (NO3-) by soil microorganisms.  This process, while less significant in terms of overall nitrogen fixation compared to biological processes, represents a natural pathway for atmospheric nitrogen to enter the terrestrial ecosystem.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Allopatric speciation, also known as geographic speciation, is a well-established mechanism of speciation.  Geographic isolation prevents gene flow between populations, allowing them to diverge genetically over time due to factors like genetic drift, natural selection, and mutation. Eventually, these separated populations become reproductively isolated, meaning they can no longer interbreed even if they come back into contact.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Sympatric speciation is a less common but still valid mechanism of speciation. It occurs when new species arise within the same geographic area without geographic isolation.  This can happen due to various factors, including disruptive selection (where individuals with extreme traits have higher fitness), polyploidy (sudden changes in chromosome number), and sexual selection (where mate choice drives divergence).  While less frequent than allopatric speciation, sympatric speciation has been observed in several species.\n"

The nitrogen cycle is a gaseous cycle, with the atmosphere serving as the primary reservoir.  Nitrogen fixation, carried out by certain bacteria and cyanobacteria, converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3) or other usable forms like nitrates (NO3-).

Pioneer species, whether in primary or secondary succession, are crucial.  They are adapted to harsh conditions (e.g., lichens on bare rock, grasses on burned land) and their presence alters the environment, making it more suitable for subsequent species.

However, the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in this region, linked to aerosols, represents a significant shift in regional climate patterns.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes the role of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in influencing monsoon rainfall.  The ATAL, a layer of aerosols in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, contains significant amounts of sulphates and black carbon.  These aerosols have a cooling effect on the Earth's surface by scattering incoming solar radiation. While this might seem beneficial, it can disrupt the land-sea temperature gradient, a crucial driving force for the monsoon circulation. A weaker temperature gradient reduces the intensity of the monsoon winds, potentially leading to decreased rainfall over large areas.  The interaction between ATAL and El Ni\u00f1o events further amplifies the negative impact on rainfall, particularly in central India.\n"

Ocean acidification reduces the buffering capacity of oceans by hindering their ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide at a rate that exceeds their natural capacity, leading to depressed metabolic rates and immune responses in some marine organisms.\n2. The decrease in carbonate ions caused by increased atmospheric CO2 levels makes it difficult for marine calcifying organisms, such as corals and calcareous plankton, to form biogenic calcium carbonate, threatening the base of aquatic food webs and commercial fisheries.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nBoth statements accurately reflect significant consequences of ocean acidification. Statement 1 correctly points out the diminished buffering capacity of the oceans. While oceans act as a crucial sink for atmospheric CO2, absorbing a substantial portion of anthropogenic emissions, this absorption comes at a cost. The rate of CO2 uptake is exceeding the oceans' natural ability to buffer the resulting changes in pH.  This oversaturation leads to increased acidity, which has detrimental effects on various marine organisms. Depressed metabolic rates and weakened immune responses are observed in many species, making them more vulnerable to disease and environmental stressors.\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the impact on marine calcifying organisms.  The absorption of CO2 leads to the formation of carbonic acid, bicarbonate, and carbonate ions in seawater. However, the increase in atmospheric CO2 levels shifts this equilibrium, resulting in a decrease in carbonate ions (CO32-). Carbonate ions are essential building blocks for the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms, including corals and calcareous plankton. The reduced availability of carbonate ions makes it harder for these organisms to build and maintain their calcium carbonate structures, leading to slower growth, weakened shells, and increased vulnerability. This, in turn, impacts the entire aquatic food web, as these organisms form the base of many food chains, and threatens commercial fisheries that rely on these species.\n"

Natural upwelling of nutrient-rich waters can lead to localized hypoxic conditions.  Human activities, however, exacerbate the problem by introducing excessive nutrients (eutrophication) from sources like agricultural runoff and industrial discharge, creating larger and more frequent dead zones than would naturally occur.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Gulf of Mexico is well-known for a large, annually recurring dead zone.  The primary cause is the massive influx of nutrient-rich agricultural runoff from the Mississippi River basin, which fuels excessive algal growth, ultimately leading to oxygen depletion in the deeper waters. The fertilizers used in agriculture are a major contributor to this process.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is accurate. Mixed cropping, also known as diverse cropping or polyculture, offers several advantages.  By diversifying crops, it improves soil health through varying nutrient demands and natural pest control mechanisms. The presence of diverse plants provides habitats for natural predators, thus reducing reliance on chemical pesticides.  The risk of complete crop failure is also mitigated as the failure of one crop doesn\u2019t necessarily impact the others. This aligns with the principles of sustainable agriculture, aiming for environmental protection and economic viability.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Monoculture, the practice of cultivating a single crop variety over a large area, presents significant drawbacks. While initially productive, it depletes soil nutrients faster due to the consistent demand of a single crop. This necessitates increased fertilizer application, potentially leading to soil degradation and water pollution. The lack of biodiversity also makes the crop more susceptible to pests and diseases, necessitating higher pesticide usage, harming the environment and potentially human health.  The economic dependence on high input costs makes monoculture a less sustainable practice in the long run, especially considering the growing concerns about environmental impact and resource depletion.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Diclofenac, commonly used as a veterinary drug, has proven highly toxic to vultures.  It directly inhibits uric acid secretion in their kidneys, leading to renal failure and ultimately death. This has been a major factor in the drastic decline of several Indian vulture species. The lack of a specific enzyme in vultures to break down diclofenac exacerbates this effect.  The consequence is a significant impact on vulture populations, disrupting their role as natural scavengers and impacting ecosystem health.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While it's true that the Himalayan Vulture and Eurasian Griffon were less impacted than other Gyps species, this is primarily due to their habitat and not solely their migratory patterns. These vultures are primarily mountain-dwelling and spend only winters in India. Their exposure to diclofenac-treated livestock carcasses is therefore significantly lower compared to vultures inhabiting the plains where diclofenac use in livestock is more prevalent.

This is a key characteristic frequently discussed in ecological studies of tropical rainforests.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While tropical rainforests do exhibit high biodiversity, their soils are actually relatively nutrient-poor. The rapid decomposition of organic matter is true, but the nutrients are quickly taken up by the dense vegetation and are not stored in the soil itself.  Nutrients are primarily stored in the biomass (living plants and animals) of the rainforest, making the soil susceptible to erosion and leaching when the forest is disturbed. This is a crucial aspect of rainforest ecology, often emphasized in discussions about deforestation and its consequences.

Podzols are indeed typical soils of coniferous biomes (Taiga or Boreal forests), but they are characterized by *low* humus content and *poor* drainage, not high humus and excellent drainage. The slow decomposition of conifer needles and the acidic conditions lead to nutrient-poor soil.  The statement incorrectly describes the soil characteristics, leading to a misunderstanding of the biome's overall productivity and biodiversity.  The low nutrient availability in Podzol soils restricts plant growth and limits biodiversity compared to other soil types.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The low productivity of the Taiga biome is directly linked to the harsh climate (short growing season, cold temperatures) and the nutrient-poor nature of podzol soils.  The slow decomposition of conifer litter further contributes to the low nutrient availability, hindering plant growth and overall ecosystem productivity. This makes the Taiga biome less diverse than other forest biomes with more fertile soils.  Understanding the relationship between soil type, climate, and biome productivity is crucial for comprehending ecological dynamics.\n"

Pollination by insects and other animals is essential for plant reproduction and the production of many food crops.  These are vital regulating services that provide significant benefits to human society.\n"

This process is essential for making nitrogen available to the biosphere.\n\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the processes of nitrification and denitrification.  Nitrification involves the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrites (NO2-) and then to nitrates (NO3-) by specific groups of bacteria.  Nitrates are the primary form of nitrogen readily absorbed by plants.  Denitrification, on the other hand, is the conversion of nitrates back into gaseous nitrogen (N2), a process carried out by other bacterial species under anaerobic conditions.  This process returns nitrogen to the atmosphere, completing the cycle. Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy and completeness of both statements in describing the essential steps of nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification within the nitrogen cycle.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are highly effective in removing particulate matter (PM) from exhaust streams, achieving removal efficiencies exceeding 99% in many cases. However, they are less effective at removing gaseous pollutants.  Gaseous pollutants require different control technologies, such as scrubbers for SO2 and NOx removal, or catalytic converters for CO and VOCs.  The statement incorrectly attributes the removal of gaseous pollutants to ESPs.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Catalytic converters utilize precious metal catalysts (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) to facilitate chemical reactions that convert harmful exhaust components.  Primarily, carbon monoxide (CO) is oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2), and unburnt hydrocarbons (HCs) are oxidized to CO2 and water (H2O).  Additionally, catalytic converters reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by converting them to nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).  The effective functioning of catalytic converters is crucial for reducing vehicular emissions and improving air quality.\n"
