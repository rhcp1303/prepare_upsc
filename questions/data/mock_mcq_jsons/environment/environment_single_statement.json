This recommendation stemmed from a comprehensive assessment of the region's ecological fragility and the need for stringent conservation measures.  The report emphasized a bottom-up approach, involving Gram Sabhas in the decision-making process.  Options (a) and (b) represent percentages suggested by the Kasturirangan Committee and the subsequent October 2018 notification, respectively, both of which diluted the Gadgil Committee's more stringent recommendations. Option (d) is a percentage representing a subset of the ESA suggested by the Gadgil Committee.

Large body size can increase vulnerability to extinction due to factors like slower reproductive rates and higher resource needs, making them more sensitive to environmental changes. A narrow niche signifies specialized adaptations, making species more susceptible to habitat loss or environmental shifts.  Lack of genetic variability reduces a species' adaptive capacity, increasing its risk of extinction in the face of environmental change or disease.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (b). An ecological niche encompasses the species' role and position within its ecosystem, encompassing its interactions with other organisms and its utilization of resources.  While the geographical area (habitat) and food sources are components of a niche, the niche's definition is broader.  It's about the species' functional role, including its interactions with other species (competition, predation, symbiosis), its resource requirements (food, water, shelter), and its impact on the ecosystem. No two species can occupy the same niche in the same habitat due to competitive exclusion.  Understanding ecological niches is crucial for conservation biology, predicting species interactions, and managing ecosystems.\n"

It's a zone of overlap where the characteristics of both ecosystems blend, creating a unique ecological environment.  This contrasts with an ecocline, which represents a gradual change in environmental factors across a gradient, not necessarily a distinct boundary between two ecosystems.  A biome is a much larger-scale ecological region characterized by specific climate and vegetation, encompassing numerous ecosystems. A habitat, on the other hand, is the specific environment where an organism lives, a much smaller and more localized concept than an ecotone.  Understanding ecotones is crucial in conservation biology, as these transition zones often exhibit high biodiversity and are sensitive to environmental changes.\n"

These operations expose sulfide minerals to air and water, initiating chemical reactions that produce sulfuric acid.  This acidic water then leaches heavy metals from the surrounding rocks and soil, contaminating nearby water bodies. While copper smelting also involves sulfide ores and can contribute to heavy metal pollution, the scale and direct association with AMD are more significant in the iron and steel industry due to the massive quantities of ore extracted and the extensive mining operations involved.

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nMagnetite (Fe3O4), a magnetic iron oxide, is used as a solid lubricant in brake pads.  The friction during braking causes the wear and tear of brake pads, releasing magnetite particles into the environment. These particles, being fine and airborne, can accumulate in the air and potentially pose health risks. While magnetite might be present in other sources like power plants (as a component of fly ash), the direct and significant source of airborne magnetite pollution linked to neurodegenerative concerns is the wear and tear of brake pads in vehicles.  Microwave ovens and telephone lines do not directly emit significant amounts of magnetite particles into the environment.  Understanding the sources and health impacts of various types of pollution is essential for effective public health strategies.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nMottling of teeth is a condition caused by excessive fluoride intake.  A deficiency in fluoride, on the other hand, increases the risk of dental cavities and can contribute to bone deformities over the long term.  Erosion of nails is not directly linked to fluoride deficiency.  The absence of fluoride leads to weaker tooth enamel, making teeth more susceptible to cavities.  Over time, insufficient fluoride can also negatively impact bone density and strength.  Understanding the effects of both fluoride deficiency and excess is crucial for public health and water quality management.\n"

This reaction reduces the concentration of OH radicals, diminishing the atmosphere's natural ability to cleanse itself from pollutants.  Thus, NPs do not enhance but rather hinder the pollutant scrubbing capacity.  The other statements accurately reflect various environmental impacts of NPs, including their contribution to dust cloud formation, ozone depletion, and stratospheric cooling.  Understanding the complex interactions of NPs in the environment is critical for evaluating their overall ecological consequences.\n"

This water treatment process uses coagulants (like aluminum sulfate, ferric sulfate, or sodium aluminate) to neutralize the charges of tiny dirt particles in water, causing them to clump together into larger, settleable flocs.  Sedimentation is a subsequent step where these flocs settle, while filtration further removes remaining impurities. Disinfection, using chlorine or ozone, is a later stage to eliminate pathogens.
