Option 1 is incorrect; Kos Minars are associated with the medieval period, not the Vijayanagara Empire. Option 3 is incorrect; while the Gupta Empire flourished during Nalanda's existence, it was initially founded by Kumargupta I under the Gupta Empire, and the exact nature of its association with the Gupta Empire is a subject of scholarly debate.

This is well-documented in historical records and archaeological findings.  Option 1 correctly reflects this significant aspect of Chola history. Option 2 incorrectly attributes the destruction of the Chera navy to the Vijayanagara Empire. This naval victory is associated with the Chola king Rajaraja I. Option 3 is also incorrect; the annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka was primarily a Chola achievement under Rajaraja I and further solidified under Rajendra I.  The Pandya kingdom, while possessing a naval presence, did not undertake expeditions on the scale or with the same geographical reach as the Cholas. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of South Indian history, specifically the maritime power of the Chola Empire and its distinction from other contemporary kingdoms.

Option 1 accurately reflects this widespread practice. The Alpine Pasture season, a specific type of transhumance, is indeed prominent in Switzerland and is also found, albeit on a smaller scale, in certain parts of the Himalayas.

Furthermore, Chola naval expeditions under Rajendra I did conquer regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The other pairs contain inaccuracies. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9, not 7.5.

KIRTI is aimed at school children between 9 and 18 years, not college students aged 18-25.  This highlights a common misconception regarding the age group targeted by youth development programs.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the scheme's target demographic.\n\n2. **Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS):** The statement is incorrect. While TOPS does provide a monthly allowance, it's not limited to only Olympic medalists.  It supports India's top athletes with the potential to win medals at the Olympics, encompassing a broader range of athletes in training and preparation.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the scheme's eligibility criteria and scope.\n\n3. **National Sports Development Fund:** The statement is incorrect. The National Sports Development Fund scheme primarily supports athletes who are medal prospects for the Olympic Games, not the Commonwealth Games.  The subtle difference between the two games highlights the need for precise knowledge of the fund's objectives. The inclusion of this distractor tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar sporting events and their associated funding schemes.\n\n4. **RESET Programme:** The statement is incorrect.

The slight alteration in the year serves as a plausible distractor, testing the accuracy of the candidate's recall.\n\n2. **India's first Olympic participation:** The statement is incorrect. India first participated in the Olympics in 1900 in Paris, not the 1920 Antwerp Games. This demonstrates the importance of knowing the precise year of India's Olympic debut. The inclusion of a later Olympic Games as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of the early history of Indian participation in the Olympics.\n\n3. **Abhinav Bindra's Olympic Gold Medal:** The statement is incorrect. Abhinav Bindra won his gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, not the 2012 London Olympics. This tests the candidate's recall of specific achievements in Indian sports history.

The inclusion of a highly decorated sportsperson as a distractor assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar high-profile awards.\n\n\nThe question assesses the candidate's knowledge of diverse awards across different fields, testing both their awareness of Indian and international recognitions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options makes the question challenging, demanding accurate recall of specific recipients and years of award conferment.  The question integrates knowledge of film, architecture, and national honors, demonstrating an interdisciplinary approach.\n"

Option (1) is therefore correctly matched.\n\nRajendra I continued and expanded upon his father's naval achievements.  His famous naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, which encompassed regions across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly increased Chola power and influence in Southeast Asia.

The Arya Samaj also stressed universalism, promoting ethical considerations in all actions and advocating for a rational and moral approach to life.  It was indeed one of the first Hindu organizations to actively engage in proselytization, aiming to spread its philosophy and values beyond its existing adherents. All three pairs accurately reflect key principles and characteristics of the Arya Samaj. The question assesses the candidate's detailed understanding of the Arya Samaj's philosophy and its historical context within the 19th-century socio-religious landscape of India.  The inclusion of \"proselytization\" as a less commonly discussed aspect adds complexity.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (c) is correct. The IOA's establishment and recognition date are accurate. Sir Dorabji Tata was indeed its first president. TOPS's focus on funding medal prospects is also accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because Abhinav Bindra's event was the 10m air rifle, not the 100m rifle. Option (b) is wrong because the Khelo India program is not solely focused on 9-18 year olds, extending beyond that age group.  Option (d) includes the incorrect event for Abhinav Bindra. This question tests knowledge of Indian sports history, specific achievements, and government initiatives, requiring precise recall of details about individuals, organizations, and programs.

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (a) accurately reflects the functions of the ASI and the legal framework. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, indeed prevents the export of antiquities.  The NMA was established under the AMASR Act, 2010. Section 4 of the 1972 Act empowers the Central Government to declare national importance. The other options are incorrect because the ASI's primary function is not granting construction permissions (that's the NMA); and the Kashi Culture Pathway, while relevant to cultural heritage, is not directly linked to the ASI's legislative framework. This question tests understanding of Indian laws related to the protection of antiquities and cultural heritage, requiring knowledge of specific legislation and the roles of different organizations.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Chola Empire under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I undertook significant naval expeditions.  Rajaraja I's conquests included the annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka, while Rajendra I extended Chola power further, conquering the entire island. Option 1 correctly reflects this historical fact.  The Vijayanagara Empire, while powerful, was primarily a land-based empire and did not conduct major naval conquests such as the one described in option 2; their military strength was concentrated on land campaigns. Option 3 incorrectly attributes a major naval expedition to the Sailendra Empire; while they had a maritime presence,  the described expedition against the Chera navy was a Chola achievement.  Option 4 mistakenly links the Pallava kingdom to a conquest in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; this was accomplished by the Chola Empire. Thus, only pair 1 accurately reflects a historical naval expansion.  The other options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate connections between empires and naval actions, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of historical events.\n\n"

Option 3 accurately notes that the ancient Nalanda University ruins hold the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, Option 4 is incorrect.

While the NMA was established later (2010), its functions are directly related to the implementation of this Act. Therefore, option 1 is correctly matched.  Option 2 incorrectly links the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 to the constitutional provision on monument protection (Article 49); the Environment Act focuses on broader environmental concerns. Option 3 wrongly associates the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 with air pollution control; this Act primarily deals with forest conservation. Option 4 incorrectly links the Nalanda University Act, 2010, to the establishment of protected areas; its purpose is the establishment and functioning of Nalanda University.

Option 1 correctly states that a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period was unearthed at Phanigiri in Telangana.  Option 2 is incorrect; while Bavikonda Monastery does feature Mahastupas and Chaitya Grihas, these are associated with the 3rd century BCE, not the Satavahana period. Option 3 incorrectly connects Nalanda with Dolmenoid cists; these are associated with megalithic burial practices, not specifically found at Nalanda.

Its unique association with the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya makes it a focal point of religious observance. Kedarnath Temple, revered as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva, holds a prominent place in Hindu religious geography and is an integral part of the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit.

While Satavahana artifacts were found there, associating it solely with the Satavahanas is an oversimplification. Bavikonda Monastery dates back to the 3rd century BCE, significantly predating the Mauryan Empire's significant influence in the region. The Mauryan Empire's influence extended to the area, but the monastery\u2019s construction predates their direct rule. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, aligning with the time frame of megalithic cultures.  Salihundam is primarily known for its Buddhist connections, not Jainism. Jain sites are found elsewhere in the Srikakulam district, but Salihundam's main significance is Buddhist. Therefore, only Phanigiri's association with the Ikshvaku/Satavahana overlap and Ooragutta's association with the Iron Age are entirely correct.\n"

Immadi Narasimha was a key figure in the Saluva dynasty, known for consolidating power after the decline of the Sangama dynasty. Krishnadevaraya is widely recognized as the most powerful ruler of the Tuluva dynasty, a period of the Vijayanagara Empire's zenith.  Sadasiva Raya marked the beginning of the Aravidu dynasty's rule, a period characterized by internal strife and external pressures leading to the eventual decline of the empire.

However, the Kamakhya Temple's architecture is described as a mix of styles, including Nilachal style, not specifically a Pidha deula shikhara. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.\n"

The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was a major initiative to improve healthcare access and outcomes in rural areas of India.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) was a prominent economic policy pursued by India after independence, characterized by protectionist measures like high tariffs and import quotas to shield domestic industries from foreign competition and encourage their growth.

Rajaraja I's conquests extended to the Maldives, while Rajendra I's conquests included parts of Sri Lanka and the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia.  The statement about the Cholas invading the Maldives is therefore correct.  The Pandyas were known for their extensive maritime trade, including a significant role in pearl farming. Option 2 is thus correct.  The Pallavas primarily focused on land-based conquests in South India, and the Guptas while having a strong trade presence, are not primarily known for major naval conquests in the same way as the Cholas and Pandyas.  Options 3 and 4 are therefore incorrect. The question tests factual recall of the major maritime activities of different South Indian dynasties and their geographical reach.

Option 1 is therefore correct.  While Rajendra I continued and expanded Chola naval power, the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai is primarily associated with Rajaraja I's reign. This makes Option 2 incorrect. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center, facilitating flourishing trade with Southeast Asia under the Chola's \"Look East Policy,\" making Option 3 correct. Therefore, the correct combination is 1 and 3.  The other options incorrectly attribute actions to the wrong rulers or exaggerate the direct impact of specific naval expeditions on trade. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Chola history and the ability to differentiate between the actions of different rulers within the same dynasty.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty during the 2nd century BCE, not the Satavahana dynasty.  Salihundam is a significant Buddhist site associated with the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia, but its primary association isn't with the Gupta period.  The Gupta period is known for its own distinct architectural and artistic styles, and while there might have been Buddhist sites active during that time, Salihundam's prominence predates the Gupta era significantly. Nandi Hills, known for its Neolithic era caves, are not directly linked to the Mauryan Empire.  The Mauryan Empire's significant architectural achievements were primarily in other regions. However, Phanigiri, a Buddhist site in Telangana, is correctly linked to the Ikshvaku period, as evidenced by excavated coins and inscriptions.  The Ikshvaku dynasty flourished in the 2nd-3rd centuries CE in the Krishna River valley, and Phanigiri's archaeological finds strongly support this association.

However, Periyar's direct leadership of the Vaikom Satyagraha is incorrect; while he supported it, he was not its primary leader.

Harihara II, though less prominent than his predecessors, ruled during a period of transition within the Sangama Dynasty.  Krishnadevaraya is widely recognized as the most significant ruler of the Tuluva Dynasty, a period of significant expansion and prosperity for the Vijayanagara Empire.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Immadi Narasimha was a significant ruler, but he belonged to the Saluva Dynasty, not the Tuluva. Similarly, Sadasiva Raya was a ruler of the Aravidu Dynasty, marking a period of decline for the empire.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the chronological order and key figures associated with the different dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire.

The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi exhibits a blend of styles, but it is not primarily Vesara.  The Kedarnath Temple's architecture is indeed a unique blend, not strictly classifiable as Nagara or Dravidian. The main temple at Sanchi, however, is accurately described as having a design that deviates from both Dravidian and Nagara styles. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.
