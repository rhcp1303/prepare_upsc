The question tests the ability to identify a dance form based on its distinctive features, requiring more than just general knowledge of Indian classical dance.

Option (a) is partially correct as Rajaraja I did lead an expedition to the Maldives, but it did not result in annexation to the same extent as Sri Lanka under Rajendra I.

Rajendra I, a prominent Chola ruler, launched a major naval campaign that led to the conquest of Sri Lanka, resulting in the entire island becoming a Chola province. While Rajaraja I also engaged in significant naval expeditions, his conquests did not result in the complete annexation of Sri Lanka. Rajaraja I's naval activities primarily focused on weakening the Chera navy and expanding Chola influence in the Bay of Bengal region.  The Maldives were also subjected to Chola influence, but the scale of conquest under Rajendra I in Sri Lanka was considerably larger and more impactful, making it a more significant event in Chola history. Option (a) is incorrect because while Rajaraja I did conquer parts of the Maldives, it wasn't a large-scale annexation like Sri Lanka under Rajendra I.

The open eyes symbolize that justice is not blind but actively engages with societal complexities, while the replacement of the sword with the Constitution highlights the Constitution's central role in Indian jurisprudence. Option (a) is incorrect because the change is a departure from purely classical representations. Option (b) is partially correct in mentioning impartiality, but misses the crucial decolonization aspect. Option (d) is incorrect as it overstates the rejection of Western legal traditions; the scales represent a continued commitment to impartial weighing of evidence.\n"

The question specifically highlights maritime dominance in the Bay of Bengal and a far-reaching trade network in Southeast Asia. The Cholas, under rulers like Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, built a powerful navy that allowed them to dominate the Bay of Bengal, conduct extensive trade with Southeast Asian nations, and even launch successful military campaigns in Sri Lanka and parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Option (a) is incorrect because while the Vijayanagara Empire was powerful, its naval power was not as dominant as the Cholas'.  Option (b) correctly identifies the Chera's naval power but understates its scope; it was not as extensive as the Chola empire. Option (d) is incorrect because the Pallava's naval activities, while present, were not as significant as those of the Cholas.\n"

The Salt Satyagraha, Non-Cooperation Movement, and Quit India Movement were all important events in India's struggle for independence, but they did not directly address caste-based discrimination in the same way the Vaikom Satyagraha did.
