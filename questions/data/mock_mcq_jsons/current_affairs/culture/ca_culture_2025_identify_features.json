Krishnadevaraya's reign (1509-1529) was a period of significant expansion for the empire.  His military campaigns resulted in the acquisition of the Raichur doab and victories over Orissa and Bijapur. Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. While Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories to rule, they collected taxes and retained a portion of the revenue.  However, their positions, while often hereditary, were ultimately granted by the Raya (king) and were not strictly hereditary in all cases.  The statement oversimplifies the complex nature of their authority. Statement 4 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple and Vithala Temple Complex at Hampi are renowned examples of Vijayanagara architecture.  Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) are entirely accurate.\n"

Statement 3 is also correct; he strongly advocated a return to what he considered the original Vedic principles. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Satyartha Prakash was written in Hindi, not Sanskrit.  While he is strongly associated with the Arya Samaj movement, he didn't directly establish it in the same way a formal organization is founded. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.  The nuances related to the Arya Samaj's founding and the language of the Satyartha Prakash require careful consideration.\n"

The split stemmed from differing views on the language of religious instruction and dietary practices, not necessarily ideological differences.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. One of the core tenets of Arya Samaj philosophy emphasized the ethical basis of actions, advocating for a life guided by moral principles and rational thought. This emphasis on ethical conduct is a fundamental aspect of their teachings.\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct. While disagreements over dietary practices were a contributing factor to the 1892 split, the dispute also centered on the language used for religious instruction and education within the Arya Samaj.

His powerful address at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago solidified his status as a global spiritual leader. The Ramakrishna Mission, founded in 1897, continues to this day as a major force in social service, education, and healthcare across India and internationally.  Finally, his influence on Jamsetji Tata, leading to the establishment of the prestigious Indian Institute of Science (IISc), highlights his forward-thinking approach to blending spirituality with scientific advancement.  Option 5 is incorrect; while Swami Vivekananda wrote extensively, *Jnana Yoga* is not a work directly attributed to him.

The Bharat Ratna is indeed India's highest civilian award, bestowed by the President upon individuals for outstanding service in any field, and P. V. Narasimha Rao was a recipient. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the Prime Minister makes a recommendation to the President, it is not a formal or mandatory process.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Bharat Ratna does not include a monetary grant\u2014only a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.

The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative indeed aims to boost the international standing of Indian cotton through robust branding, complete traceability (enabled by blockchain technology), and rigorous certification.  Ginners, who operate cotton gins, are empowered to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and the industry itself.

Project PARI aims to democratize art by creating public installations in urban areas, transforming these spaces into accessible art galleries. The project encompasses diverse traditional Indian art forms like Thangka, Cheriyal painting, and others.  It is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the National Gallery of Modern Art. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Project PARI is a joint initiative of Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not solely implemented by the latter.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe Project PARI.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements regarding the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:\n\n1.

The initiative aims to improve the tourist experience by connecting visitors with local people who act as friendly ambassadors and storytellers for their region. It operates across 50 tourist destinations in India.  A key component is the development of new tourism products and experiences, such as food and craft tours, often involving the training of women and youth. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while there's a special emphasis on training women and youth, the initiative isn't exclusively focused on women's training.  Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe the initiative.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:\n\n1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.\n2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n3.  The Chola navy's dominance extended to the Arabian Sea but not the Bay of Bengal.\n4. Nagapattinam served as a significant naval base for the Chola Empire.\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately depict the Chola Empire's naval power?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Rajaraja I's naval forces did indeed defeat the Chera navy (not Pandya) at Kandalursalai. Rajendra I significantly expanded Chola naval power through conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Nagapattinam was a crucial naval center for the Chola Empire. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Chola navy's influence extended to both the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, demonstrating their considerable maritime capabilities.  Therefore, three of the statements accurately reflect the Chola naval expeditions.\n\n\n\n7. Consider the following about the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:\n\n1. It is primarily led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n2. Transhumance involves the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.\n3. The initiative focuses on modernizing traditional transhumance practices.\n4.  Transhumance traditions in India are primarily found in the Himalayan region.\n\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately describe the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2 and 4 are correct.  Transhumance is accurately defined as the seasonal movement of livestock and associated human communities.  In India, this practice is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative is led by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), not UNESCO. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the initiative focuses on preserving, not modernizing, traditional transhumance practices, emphasizing their cultural and ecological significance.  Thus, only two statements accurately reflect the initiative.\n\n\n8. Consider the following aspects of the Vaikom Satyagraha:\n\n1. It was a protest against the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.\n2.  The movement was solely led by Mahatma Gandhi.\n3.  It resulted in the immediate opening of all roads leading to the temple to all castes.\n4. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a crucial role in the movement.\n\n\nHow many of the statements above correctly describe the Vaikom Satyagraha?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 4 are correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from the temple.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a significant figure, mobilizing support and participating actively.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, it wasn't solely led by him.  Many other leaders and activists were involved. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Satyagraha resulted in the opening of only three out of four roads leading to the temple, not all of them.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Vaikom Satyagraha.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Kakori Train Action:\n\n1. It was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).\n2. The primary objective was to secure funds for revolutionary activities.\n3.  The action took place near Kakori in Bihar.\n4. Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure involved.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the Kakori Train Action?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Kakori Train Action was indeed carried out by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) to obtain funds for their revolutionary activities. Ram Prasad Bismil was a prominent participant. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the action took place near Kakori in Uttar Pradesh, not Bihar.  Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe the Kakori Train Action.\n\n\n10. Consider the following related to the  Arya Samaj:\n\n1.  It was the first Hindu organization to actively promote proselytization.\n2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati was a key figure in its establishment.\n3.  Its principles are entirely based on the rejection of Vedic scriptures.\n4.  It established numerous educational institutions and orphanages.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly characterize the Arya Samaj?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Arya Samaj was indeed a pioneering Hindu organization in its active promotion of proselytization. Swami Dayanand Saraswati was its founder and a central figure.  The Arya Samaj also established a significant number of educational institutions and orphanages. However, statement 3 is incorrect; its principles are not based on rejecting Vedic scriptures but rather on a reinterpretation and emphasis on certain aspects of them. Therefore, only three of the statements correctly describe the Arya Samaj.\n\n\n11. Consider the following about Ratan Tata's leadership of the Tata Group:\n\n1. Under his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased significantly.\n2. He launched the Tata Nano, a revolutionary car model.\n3.  The Tata Group became one of India's largest employers under his tenure.\n4.  He received the Padma Shri award for his contributions.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect Ratan Tata's legacy at the Tata Group?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  Ratan Tata's leadership saw a dramatic surge in the Tata Group's revenue. He oversaw the launch of the innovative Tata Nano. The Tata Group significantly expanded its workforce under his leadership, becoming one of India's largest employers. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Ratan Tata received numerous prestigious awards, including the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, the Padma Shri is not among them.  Therefore, only three of the statements accurately reflect Ratan Tata's contributions to the Tata Group.\n\n\n12. Consider the following initiatives to promote sports in India:\n\n1. The Khelo India program focuses solely on elite-level athletes.\n2. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides comprehensive support to India's top athletes.\n3. The National Sports Development Fund scheme primarily funds grassroots-level sports development.\n4. The \"One School-One Sport\" policy is implemented across all schools in India.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe sports promotion initiatives in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2 is correct. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) indeed provides comprehensive support to India's top athletes.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Khelo India program, while supporting elite athletes, also focuses on grassroots development. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Khelo India program aims to identify and nurture talent at both grassroots and elite levels. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the National Sports Development Fund supports a range of athletes, not just grassroots-level ones. Statement 4 is incorrect; the \"One School-One Sport\" policy is implemented in Sainik Schools, not all schools in India.  Therefore, only two of the statements accurately describe the initiatives.\n\n\n13. Consider the following regarding the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor Agreement:\n\n1. It allows visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan.\n2. Pakistani Sikhs can visit Dera Baba Nanak in India without an Indian visa.\n3.  The agreement restricts the corridor's use to Sikh pilgrims only.\n4. Pakistan levies a fee on each pilgrim visiting through the corridor.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor Agreement?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 4 are correct. The agreement does facilitate visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur. Pakistan does levy a fee per pilgrim. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Pakistani Sikhs require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak. Statement 3 is also incorrect; there's no restriction on the faith of pilgrims using the corridor. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the agreement's provisions.\n\n\n14. Consider the following about the Santhal Rebellion:\n\n1. Karl Marx referred to it as India's first organized mass revolution.\n2. The rebellion directly led to the abolition of the Zamindari system.\n3.  The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was enacted in response to the rebellion.\n4. The rebellion primarily took place in the present-day state of Bihar.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the Santhal Rebellion?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 3 are correct.  Karl Marx did refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was indeed a direct consequence of the rebellion. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Zamindari system wasn't abolished as a direct result of the rebellion.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the rebellion impacted Bihar, its primary location was in the Santhal Parganas region, which spans across present-day Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha. Therefore, only two of the statements accurately reflect the Santhal Rebellion.\n\n\n15. Consider the following about the Odisha Famine of 1866:\n\n1. It is also known as the \"Na-Anka Famine.\"\n2. The famine was primarily caused by widespread locust attacks.\n3. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw was the Commissioner of Odisha during the famine.\n4. The Puri Canal was constructed as a direct response to the famine.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the Odisha Famine of 1866?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was known as the \"Na-Anka Famine.\" Thomas Edward Ravenshaw held the position of Commissioner of Odisha during the famine. The construction of the Puri Canal followed the famine. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the famine's causes were multifaceted, including administrative failures, natural disasters, and economic factors, not solely locust attacks. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately describe the Odisha Famine.\n\n\n16. Consider the following regarding the Battle of Saragarhi:\n\n1. It was fought between the British Indian Army and Afghan tribesmen.\n2.  All 21 Sikh soldiers involved were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\n3. The battle took place at Saragarhi in present-day Pakistan.\n4. Havildar Ishar Singh led the Sikh soldiers in the battle.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the Battle of Saragarhi?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army (specifically, the 36th Sikh Regiment) and Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen. The battle took place in present-day Pakistan. Havildar Ishar Singh was the leader of the Sikh soldiers who displayed extraordinary bravery. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross. Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe the Battle of Saragarhi.\n\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": " Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Kozhikode's location on the Malabar Coast, its role in the spice trade, and the etymological link to \"calico\" are all mentioned. However, statement 3 is incorrect; it was ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins), not the Cholas, during the medieval period.  Therefore, three of the four statements are accurate.\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:\n\n1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.\n2. Rajendra I's naval campaigns led to the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka.\n3. Chola naval expeditions reached as far as the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the extent of Chola naval power?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2, and 3\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements are accurate representations of the Chola Empire's significant naval achievements.  Rajaraja I, a prominent Chola ruler, significantly expanded the empire's maritime power.  His naval forces achieved a decisive victory against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, demonstrating their dominance in the region.  This victory solidified Chola control over crucial sea lanes and trade routes.  Similarly, Rajendra I, the successor to Rajaraja I, continued this naval prowess. His campaigns culminated in the complete conquest of Sri Lanka, transforming it into a Chola province.  This illustrates the Chola navy's ability to conduct large-scale military operations across significant distances.  Finally, Rajendra I's expeditions extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the remarkable reach and capabilities of the Chola navy. This far-reaching expansion highlights the Chola Empire's influence not just regionally, but also across the Indian Ocean, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of naval strategy and logistics.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d), encompassing all three aspects of Chola naval expansion.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to recognize the full extent of the Chola Empire's naval dominance.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the UNESCO's World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:\n\n1. The initiative is primarily led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan.\n2. Transhumance is the seasonal migration of livestock, often involving human communities.\n3. In 2023, transhumance practices in both Europe and the Himalayas were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the initiative and the concept of transhumance?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements accurately reflect aspects of the UNESCO's World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and the broader concept of transhumance. Statement 1 correctly identifies ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) as the lead organization behind the initiative, supported by Azerbaijan.  Statement 2 accurately defines transhumance as the traditional practice of seasonal movement of livestock, often involving the migration of human communities alongside their herds. This practice is a significant aspect of many cultures and ecosystems globally, contributing to both cultural heritage and ecological balance. Statement 3 is also correct. In 2023, UNESCO did indeed recognize two distinct transhumance traditions \u2013 one encompassing ten European states and another focused on the Alpine pastures of Switzerland \u2013 as Intangible Cultural Heritage. This recognition underscores the importance of preserving these traditional practices and the associated cultural knowledge. Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as all three statements are accurate and reflect different facets of the transhumance initiative and concept.\n\n\n3. Consider the following elements related to the Harappan Civilization:\n\n1. Standardized weights and measures indicating extensive trade networks.\n2. The discovery of a bearded male figure in Mohenjo-daro, interpreted as a priest.\n3.  The presence of a sophisticated, yet undeciphered pictographic script.\n\nHow many of the above features are considered hallmarks of the Harappan Civilization?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements accurately reflect key features of the Harappan Civilization. The use of standardized weights and measures is strong evidence of a well-organized and extensive trade network across the Indus Valley and beyond.  This system facilitated efficient exchange of goods and services, contributing to the economic prosperity of the civilization. The discovery of the bearded male figure in Mohenjo-daro, often interpreted as a priest-king or religious figure, points to a sophisticated social hierarchy and a developed religious system. This artifact provides valuable insights into Harappan societal structures and beliefs.  Furthermore, the Harappan civilization possessed a unique pictographic writing system, written in a boustrophedon style (alternating left-to-right and right-to-left). Although this script remains undeciphered, its existence demonstrates a high level of cultural and intellectual development.  The fact that it hasn't been deciphered doesn't diminish its significance as a hallmark of the civilization.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c) because all three mentioned features are well-established characteristics of the Harappan Civilization.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal:\n\n1. It is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme.\n2. Lothal's historical significance includes possessing the oldest known man-made dry dock.\n3. The NMHC aims to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the NMHC project and Lothal's importance?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2, and 3\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements accurately describe the NMHC project at Lothal and its context.  The NMHC is indeed being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, a significant initiative by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways aimed at promoting port-led development.  Lothal's historical importance is undeniable, with the discovery of a man-made dry dock dating back to approximately 2400 BC. This discovery offers compelling evidence of advanced nautical technology and maritime practices during the Indus Valley Civilization.  Finally, the NMHC's stated aim is to comprehensively showcase India's rich maritime heritage, encompassing its history from ancient times to the present day.  This reflects a broader objective to highlight India's seafaring legacy and its role in global maritime history.  Therefore, the correct option is (d) as all three statements correctly represent facts related to the NMHC and Lothal.\n\n\n5.  Consider the following regarding the Charaideo Moidams in Assam:\n\n1. They are considered comparable to the Egyptian Pyramids.\n2.  They represent the burial sites of the Tai-Ahom royalty.\n3. Their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List marked the first time a North-Eastern site received recognition under the Cultural Category.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the Charaideo Moidams?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements accurately describe key aspects of the Charaideo Moidams.  The grand earthen mounds are indeed often compared to the Egyptian Pyramids due to their scale and significance as royal burial sites. This comparison highlights their monumental nature and the advanced construction techniques employed.  The Moidams served as the necropolis for the Tai-Ahom dynasty, reflecting their importance in Ahom culture and history. The burial practices and associated rituals demonstrate a rich and complex cultural heritage.  The inscription of the Charaideo Moidams on the UNESCO World Heritage List was a landmark event, marking the first time a site from North-East India received recognition under the Cultural Category. This recognition underscores the global significance of the Moidams and the unique cultural heritage they represent. Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as all three statements are factually accurate.\n\n\n\n6. Consider the following features associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya:\n\n1. Its main temple is constructed in a classical Indian architectural style, with a curvilinear shikhara.\n2. The Vajrasana (Diamond Throne) marks the spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.\n3.  The complex includes the sacred Bodhi Tree, a direct descendant of the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nHow many of the above features are considered integral parts of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements correctly identify key features of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex.  The main temple's architectural style, characterized by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), is a prominent aspect of its design. This architectural style reflects the influence of classical Indian temple architecture, contributing to the temple's visual appeal and historical significance.  The Vajrasana, or Diamond Throne, is a central feature of the complex, marking the exact spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. This makes it a place of immense religious significance for Buddhists worldwide. The sacred Bodhi Tree, a direct descendant of the original tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment, holds deep spiritual importance for Buddhists.  Its presence within the complex adds to its sacred aura and attracts pilgrims from across the globe.  Therefore, all three features are integral and accurately described, making (c) the correct answer.\n\n\n7. Consider the following statements regarding the Sangameshwar Temple:\n\n1. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers.\n2.  Annual flooding from the Srisailam dam submerges the temple.\n3. Other temples with the name \"Sangameshwar\" exist in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements accurately describe aspects of the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh. The temple is indeed dedicated to Lord Shiva and is situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, a location of significant religious importance. The temple's location at the confluence of these rivers is a key aspect of its religious significance. The annual flooding caused by the Srisailam dam's backwaters is a recurring event, highlighting the temple's vulnerability to environmental factors.  This creates a unique challenge for preserving the temple and its surroundings. Finally, the existence of other temples with the name \"Sangameshwar\" in various parts of India, including Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, is also a well-established fact. This reflects the widespread worship of Lord Shiva and the variations in regional temple architecture and traditions.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as all three statements are factually accurate.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding the Ahom Dynasty in Assam:\n\n1. The dynasty's origins trace back to a Shan prince from Mong Mao.\n2.  The Ahom kings wielded absolute power, unconstrained by any council or advisory body.\n3.  The Ahom dynasty adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, building numerous temples.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ahom Dynasty?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTwo of the statements are accurate, while one is not.  Statement 1 correctly points to the Ahom dynasty's origins with Sukaphaa, a Shan prince from Mong Mao, who migrated to Assam across the Patkai Mountains. This migration marked the beginning of the Ahom rule in Assam, influencing its culture and political landscape. Statement 3 is also accurate. The Ahom rulers adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, significantly impacting the religious landscape of Assam.  They constructed numerous temples dedicated to these deities, showcasing their patronage of religious practices. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ahom kings held significant power, their authority was not absolute.  They were significantly influenced by a powerful council of ministers. The king's decisions often required the concurrence of the \"Patra Mantris,\" indicating a system of checks and balances within the monarchy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making (b) the right answer.\n\n\n\n9. Consider the following about the Kalinga Dynasty:\n\n1.  The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.\n2. Kharavela, a key ruler, patronized Jainism and is known for the Hathigumpha inscription.\n3. The Kalinga dynasty ruled only over present-day Odisha.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the Kalinga Dynasty and its historical context?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of the Kalinga Dynasty. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) between the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka and the Kalinga kingdom is historically significant for Ashoka's subsequent conversion to Buddhism, profoundly impacting his reign and the spread of Buddhism. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga dynasty (though not strictly from the same dynasty as the Kalinga War), is renowned for his patronage of Jainism. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved on the Kumari mountain range, provides crucial details about his reign and achievements, offering valuable insights into the dynasty's history. However, statement 3 is inaccurate. The Kalinga dynasty's territory extended beyond present-day Odisha, encompassing parts of Andhra Pradesh as well. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct, making (b) the correct option.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding Megalithic burials:\n\n1. Megalithic burials are generally associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.\n2.  The practice is primarily associated with iron tools and weaponry.\n3.  Grave goods and pottery offerings provide insights into beliefs about death and the afterlife.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of Megalithic burial practices?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three statements correctly describe aspects of Megalithic burial practices. Megalithic burials are indeed primarily associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, representing a significant cultural development. The presence of megalithic structures and associated artifacts provides valuable evidence for understanding the social and religious practices of these early societies.  The general association of Megalithic burials with iron, although not universally true, is a common feature in many regions.  The use of iron tools and weapons in these periods often coincides with the construction of these monumental burial sites. Finally, the grave goods and pottery offerings found within these burial sites provide valuable insights into the beliefs about death and the afterlife held by the people of those times. These offerings often include personal items, tools, and food, suggesting beliefs about the continuation of life beyond death.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as all three statements accurately reflect characteristics of Megalithic burial practices.\n"

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its delisting decisions solely on the \"untraceable\" status of a monument.\n2.  Delisting a monument under the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically removes all legal protection afforded to it.\n3.  The term \"Missing Monuments\" is officially recognized within the AMASR Act as a criterion for delisting.\n4. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution mandates the state to protect all ancient monuments regardless of their current status.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n",

        "option_d": "None\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the ASI's recent delisting initiative focused on \"untraceable\" monuments, the decision also considers whether a monument lacks national importance.  Delisting isn't solely based on the inability to locate a site.  The assessment involves a broader evaluation of its historical and cultural significance.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, removes ASI's conservation, protection, and maintenance responsibilities. However, it doesn't automatically void all legal protections. Other laws and regulations might still apply, depending on the monument's location and other attributes.  The removal of ASI oversight doesn't equate to complete legal deregulation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The term \"Missing Monuments\" isn't an official term within the AMASR Act. It emerged from a CAG audit report, representing an informal descriptor rather than a legally defined category for delisting.  The Act uses precise legal terminology, and this casual term isn't part of that framework.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and objects of national importance, it doesn't mandate protection for *all* ancient monuments unconditionally. The state's responsibility is focused on those deemed of national importance, a determination made through processes like those outlined in the AMASR Act.  The constitution sets a broad principle, while specific implementation relies on legislation.\n\n\nTherefore, only none of the statements are correct.\n\n"

Its design incorporates distinctly Indian elements, signifying a move away from colonial symbolism.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of the new statue's design is its depiction of Lady Justice in a saree, a conscious choice to align the symbol with Indian cultural identity and to decolonize the representation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A significant change in the new statue is the removal of the blindfold.  The open eyes represent the law's active engagement with society's complexities and the need for a nuanced understanding of justice, rather than a simplistic concept of blind impartiality.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The scales are retained in the new statue.  The scales represent the essential function of courts to weigh evidence impartially and to consider both sides before a judgment.  This element is integral to the concept of justice and has not been removed.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a feature of the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India.\n\n"

His participation and leadership were crucial to the movement's success and impact.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha resulted in partial success.  While access to some roads leading to the temple was granted, complete removal of all caste-based restrictions on temple entry took more time and further struggle.  The movement was a key step, but not the final solution.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Gandhi's and Periyar's approaches to the Vaikom Satyagraha differed significantly. While Gandhi viewed it as a Hindu reformist movement, Periyar considered it a fight against caste-based oppression.  Their perspectives diverged on the nature of the struggle and its ultimate goals, leading to a rift between them.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 is correct regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha.\n\n"

The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation, observes this day. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya is indeed associated with this significant event.

However, the last statement is inaccurate. The Satyagraha did not achieve complete temple access for all castes immediately; it was a partial success, opening only three out of four roads leading to the temple to all castes.  Therefore, only three of the four statements correctly capture the consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha.
