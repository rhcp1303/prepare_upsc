Its high temperatures facilitate the traditional method of separating chaff from grain by utilizing the wind's force.  Furthermore, the intense heat associated with the Loo can lead to a decrease in mosquito populations, thereby reducing the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria. Option (a) describes Mango showers, (b) describes Aandhi or Kali Aandhi, and (d) describes Elephanta winds.  These options incorrectly attribute the effects of other winds to the Loo.

Established in Panama City in 2012, IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body explicitly designed to improve the connection between scientific findings and policy decisions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services.  While not a UN body itself, it receives crucial support and secretariat services from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  Its global membership, exceeding 145 countries, including India, underscores its international importance in addressing critical environmental issues. Option (a) is incorrect because the CBD is a separate, legally binding international treaty focused on the conservation of biological diversity. Option (c) is incorrect because UNEP is a UN program that provides support to various environmental initiatives, including IPBES, but is not the organization itself.

The primary causes of GLOFs are geological factors (earthquakes, moraine dam breaches), morphological factors (mass movement into glacial lakes), physical factors (excessive precipitation, cryoseism), and glacial surging.  Moraine dam instability is a significant contributor, as the loose material damming the lake can fail under pressure or due to erosion.\n"

Founded in 2012 in Panama City, IPBES is explicitly designed to enhance the connection between scientific knowledge and policy decisions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services. While the CBD, UNEP, and WWF are all involved in environmental conservation, IPBES has a unique structure and mandate focused on this science-policy interface. The CBD is a treaty, UNEP is a UN program, and the WWF is a non-governmental organization.  Only IPBES directly addresses the bridging of the gap between scientific findings and policy actions concerning biodiversity and ecosystem services, making it the most accurate option.\n"

The key property that directly facilitates this is high lipid solubility.  Lipids are fats and oils, and POPs' affinity for these substances means they readily dissolve into the fatty tissues of organisms. This contrasts with water solubility, where a high water solubility would lead to easier excretion and less bioaccumulation.  While options (b) and (c) describe important characteristics of POPs, they don't directly explain the mechanism of bioaccumulation. Option (a) is incorrect because high water solubility would hinder, not help, bioaccumulation.  The high lipid solubility allows POPs to accumulate in the food chain, leading to significant health risks at higher trophic levels.\n"

La Ni\u00f1a's effect on the global climate is complex and regionally variable.  While it can lead to cooler temperatures in some areas, such as parts of the Pacific Northwest and South America, it doesn't uniformly cause cooler temperatures everywhere.  Similarly, its effect on rainfall is not consistent across the globe;  in some regions, it brings drought, while in others, it increases precipitation.  Crucially, La Ni\u00f1a's impact on the Atlantic is a reduction in wind shear, thereby making conditions more favorable for hurricane development, not strengthening wind shear as option (c) suggests.

Project Tiger, Project Dolphin, and Project Lion are all sub-schemes *under* IDWH, specifically designed for the conservation of these respective species and their habitats. The People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), while crucial for biodiversity conservation, operates under the Biological Diversity Act (2002) and focuses on documenting and safeguarding bioresources and associated traditional knowledge at the local level. It's a separate, albeit complementary, initiative not directly a component of the IDWH's core structure. The IDWH's focus is on a broader, nationwide approach to wildlife habitat development and species recovery, whereas the PBR is a grassroots, community-driven effort.  Therefore, the PBR is not a direct component of the described initiative.\n"
