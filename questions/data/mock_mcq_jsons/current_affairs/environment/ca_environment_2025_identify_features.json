        "explanation": "\n\nFlue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) is a crucial technology for reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from coal-fired power plants. It effectively removes over 90% of SO2 from flue gases (1). In India, the installation of FGD systems has been made mandatory for all coal-based TPPs (2), demonstrating a commitment to improving air quality.  FGD systems utilize various methods, including dry sorbent injection, wet limestone-based, and seawater-based approaches (3).  FGD technology specifically targets SO2, not nitrogen oxides (NOx) (4); NOx removal typically requires separate technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR).  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe FGD technology.\n"

Any disruption to this balance can lead to climate change.  All the listed factors can significantly affect this balance:\n\n1.  **The balance between incoming solar heat and outgoing terrestrial heat:** This is the fundamental basis of the heat budget.  Any imbalance, caused by changes in either incoming or outgoing radiation, directly affects the overall heat balance.\n\n2.  **Reduction in ozone layer thickness:** The ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. A thinner ozone layer allows more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface, which can indirectly influence the heat budget through increased atmospheric warming. Although not a direct effect on radiation balance, it's a significant indirect factor.\n\n3.  **Melting of glaciers:** Glaciers have high albedo (reflectivity), reflecting a significant portion of incoming solar radiation back into space.  As glaciers melt, this reflectivity decreases, leading to increased absorption of solar radiation by the Earth's surface, thus warming the planet and disturbing the heat budget.\n\n4.  **Increased volcanic activity:** Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. These aerosols can reflect sunlight back into space, temporarily cooling the planet, while greenhouse gases can trap heat, warming the planet. Both effects disrupt the heat budget.\n\n5.  **Changes in albedo:** Albedo refers to the reflectivity of the Earth's surface.  Changes in land use (e.g., deforestation), snow cover, and ice extent alter the Earth's albedo, affecting the amount of solar radiation absorbed and reflected, thereby directly impacting the heat budget.\n\nTherefore, all five factors listed can significantly disturb the Earth's heat budget.\n"

Statement 1 correctly describes a concerning trend in Southeast Asia linked to rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Warmer waters provide more energy for cyclone formation and intensification, leading to more frequent and powerful storms closer to land.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the historical pattern of cyclone distribution in the Indian subcontinent, with the Bay of Bengal experiencing a significantly higher frequency of cyclones.  Statement 3 highlights one of the contributing factors to the observed increase in cyclone frequency on India's west coast. While several factors are at play, including changes in monsoon wind systems and increased moisture levels, the warming of the Indian Ocean is a significant element. Statement 4 correctly describes the Saffir-Simpson scale, a widely used system for classifying hurricane intensity based on sustained wind speed, which is applicable to cyclones globally.  The scale provides a standardized measure of cyclone strength and potential for destruction.\n"

The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to establish India as a global hub for green hydrogen production, *usage*, and export, not just export.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While job creation is a component of a Just Energy Transition, it also encompasses broader goals of fairness, inclusivity, and minimizing negative impacts on workers and communities during the shift to cleaner energy sources.  It's not solely focused on job creation.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The National Coal Gasification Mission does aim to achieve coal gasification and liquefaction of 100 MT of coal by 2030.  This initiative aims to diversify energy sources and improve energy security.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.

Statement 4 is correct; the Union Cabinet did approve the continuation of IDWH for the 15th Finance Commission cycle. Statement 3 is also correct; IDWH supports protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and community reserves.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while it's under the Ministry of Environment, it's centrally sponsored, not state-sponsored. Statement 2 is incorrect; IDWH also focuses on wildlife protection outside protected areas.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent aspects of the IDWH scheme, making the correct answer (c).\n\n\n\n4. Consider the following statements about the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme:\n\n1. It was launched in 1971 as a purely national scientific program.\n2.  It aims to establish a scientific basis for improving the relationship between people and their environments.\n3.

The rapid melting of glaciers due to climate change leads to the formation and expansion of glacial lakes, increasing the risk of outburst floods.  The instability of moraines, which are natural dams holding back glacial lake water, is a direct consequence of glacial retreat and melting.  Intense monsoon rains increase the volume of water in these lakes, putting pressure on the moraines.  Seismically active regions like the Himalayas are prone to earthquakes and landslides, which can directly breach or destabilize moraines, causing sudden water release.  Finally, development projects, often involving road construction and other infrastructure development, increase the risk of landslides that can impact glacial lakes and trigger GLOFs.  Therefore, all five factors are interconnected and contribute significantly to the increased frequency and severity of GLOFs in the Himalayan region.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nGape limitation is a fundamental ecological concept that describes the physical constraint on the size of prey an animal can consume, primarily determined by the size of its mouth (gape).  Statement 1 is correct; the gape size directly limits what a predator can eat. Statement 3 is also correct as gape limitation significantly influences the structure of food webs. The predator-prey relationships are directly affected by the size of prey available to a predator due to its gape limitation, which in turn drives adaptations in both predator and prey species to optimize feeding efficiency and survival. For example, a predator with a small gape may evolve strategies for targeting smaller prey, while prey species may develop defenses to avoid predation. Statement 4 is incorrect; Gape limitation can be an important factor in predicting how environmental changes, such as changes in prey availability or the introduction of invasive species, will affect predator-prey interactions and the overall ecosystem stability.  Statement 2 is partially true but is oversimplified. While the predator\u2019s mouth size is the primary determinant, other factors such as jaw strength and overall body size can indirectly influence the size of prey a predator can successfully capture and consume.

The BBNJ Agreement does indeed establish a Conference of Parties (COP) as its main decision-making body, responsible for overseeing the implementation and further development of the agreement's provisions.  It also creates a clearing-house mechanism (CHM) to facilitate the sharing of information and data related to marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. This mechanism is designed to be an open-access, centralized platform, ensuring transparency and collaboration among participating nations.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The BBNJ Agreement specifically excludes warships, military aircraft, and naval auxiliaries from its application.  This is a crucial exemption acknowledging the distinct operational nature of military vessels and their activities in international waters.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The BBNJ Agreement's financial mechanism includes a voluntary trust fund, a special trust fund, and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) fund.  The reliance on voluntary contributions highlights the collaborative and flexible nature of international environmental cooperation in addressing shared challenges. The absence of mandatory contributions reflects the sensitivity of imposing financial obligations on diverse nations with varying economic capacities.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 and 3 are correct. UN-REDD is indeed a flagship UN programme focusing on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Its mandate aligns directly with the global effort to mitigate climate change and protect forest ecosystems.  Furthermore, the report correctly emphasizes that reducing deforestation is a crucial first step in mitigating climate change, as deforestation significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.  Addressing deforestation directly addresses a primary source of the problem, making afforestation and reforestation efforts more effective.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report actually found that only a minority (8 out of 20) of the top countries with high tropical deforestation rates have included quantified forest targets in their NDCs. This highlights a significant gap in global climate action, where many nations haven't yet committed to concrete targets for reducing deforestation.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The funding mechanism for UN-REDD is not solely based on mandatory contributions. While contributions from member states are important, the program also relies on a mix of funding sources, including voluntary contributions from various international organizations and other stakeholders.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 2 and 4 are correct. The LULC Atlas does indeed show an increase in double/triple cropping areas, reflecting improved agricultural intensification in certain regions.  This signifies efforts to enhance agricultural productivity from existing land resources. The Atlas also correctly points to a significant increase in built-up land, indicating urbanization and expansion of built environments across the country.  This expansion reflects population growth and economic development.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  The Atlas actually shows an *expansion* of Kharif and Rabi cropland over the past 17 years, not a decline.  This indicates that agricultural land use has remained a significant aspect of land cover changes in India.  The decrease in fallow land supports this.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Atlas shows an increase in shifting cultivation until 2016-17, it then shows a subsequent decline.  This suggests that there may be interventions to reduce unsustainable agricultural practices, but the initial increase shows the continued prevalence of shifting cultivation in certain areas.\n"

Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies are a separate approach to managing natural gas.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Gas flaring is primarily done due to safety concerns (managing pressure in oil extraction) or economic factors (the cost of transporting gas from remote locations outweighs the value of the gas).  It is not done for environmental protection.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Gas flaring releases significant amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The remoteness and inaccessibility of many oil fields make the transportation of natural gas challenging and expensive, leading to flaring as a cheaper (but environmentally damaging) alternative.\n\nStatement 5 is incorrect.  While there are efforts to reduce gas flaring globally, it is not completely banned everywhere.  Many areas still practice gas flaring due to the factors mentioned above.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Uttarakhand, not Karnataka, launched the GEPI first.  The state-level implementation is a key detail.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Kasturirangan Committee proposed a significant area of the Western Ghats for ESA designation.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct. CAMPA funds afforestation projects, but its scope is broader than just wildlife conservation.  The focus of CAMPA's funding should be understood clearly.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The GCP's aims are aligned with the 'LiFE' initiative, promoting sustainable practices and encouraging environmental responsibility.\n\n\nThese questions test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation of environmental concepts and organizations within the Indian context.  The distractors are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding Glacial Lakes and GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods):\n\n1. Glacial lakes are solely formed by the melting of glaciers and pose no other significant risks.\n2.  Moraine-dammed lakes are a type of glacial lake where water is dammed by ice.\n3. GLOFs are sudden releases of water from glacial lakes, recognized as potential climatological disasters in India's National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) 2019.\n4. The vulnerability to GLOFs in India is limited to the Himalayan states and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 3 is correct. GLOFs are indeed sudden releases of water from glacial lakes, and they are recognized as potential climatological disasters in India's NDMP 2019.  The sudden and often catastrophic nature of these events, leading to large downstream river discharges, makes them a significant concern.\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct. While the Himalayan states and UTs mentioned are highly vulnerable, other regions with glacial lakes could also experience GLOFs.  The vulnerability is not exclusively limited to those areas.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Glacial lakes are formed by the melting of glaciers, but they do pose significant risks, primarily GLOFs, but also other hazards related to their instability and potential for dam breaches.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Moraine-dammed lakes are a type of glacial lake where water is dammed by a moraine (material left behind by a moving glacier), not by ice. Ice-dammed lakes are a separate category where ice acts as the dam.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the Western Ghats:\n\n1. The Western Ghats' elevation progressively decreases from north to south.\n2. The Western Ghats are characterized by four major forest types: evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous.\n3. The Madhav Gadgil committee recommended designating only the northern part of the Western Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA).\n4.  The Western Ghats are not considered a biodiversity hotspot.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats indeed have four major forest types, reflecting the diverse climatic conditions across the region. This diversity contributes significantly to its rich biodiversity.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Western Ghats are one of the world's eight \"hottest hotspots\" of biological diversity, recognized for its exceptionally high levels of endemism (species found nowhere else).\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The elevation of the Western Ghats progressively *increases* from north to south, culminating in the highest peak, Anamudi.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Madhav Gadgil committee (Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel - WGEEP) recommended designating the *entire* Western Ghats region as an ecologically sensitive area, not just the northern part.  The committee proposed a three-tiered zoning system based on sensitivity levels.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):\n\n1. SEEA is a nationally-agreed framework for compiling environmental accounts.\n2. SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) primarily measures ecosystems and their services.\n3. SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) measures environmental assets and individual resources used by the economy.\n4. EnviStats India 2024, released by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), uses the SEEA framework.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 4 is correct. EnviStats India 2024 does indeed utilize the SEEA framework for compiling its environmental statistics, providing valuable insights into the interaction between the economy and the environment.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. SEEA is an *internationally*-agreed framework, not just a national one. It's a globally recognized standard for environmental accounting.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. SEEA-CF focuses on measuring environmental assets and individual resources used by the economy (e.g., timber, water, fish, soil).  SEEA-EA, on the other hand, measures ecosystems and the services they provide.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. This is the reverse of the actual roles of SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding Oil Spills and their management:\n\n1.  Oil spills are exclusively caused by human negligence or error.\n2.  Bioremediation uses living organisms to remove oil contaminants; examples include Oilzapper and Oilivorous-S.\n3.  Booms and skimmers are technologies used to contain and remove oil from water bodies.\n4. The impact of oil spills is limited to the immediate area of the spill and does not affect the food chain.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Bioremediation, using microorganisms that consume oil, is a significant technology in oil spill cleanup. Oilzapper and Oilivorous-S are examples of such bioremediation agents.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Booms act as physical barriers to contain the spread of oil, while skimmers are vessels used to remove oil from the water's surface.  These are crucial components of oil spill response.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Oil spills significantly impact the food chain, causing widespread damage to marine ecosystems and potentially affecting human populations that depend on those resources.  The consequences are far-reaching.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While human activity is a major cause of oil spills, accidents (such as tanker collisions or pipeline ruptures) can also lead to spills irrespective of negligence.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about sustainable agricultural practices:\n\n1. Paira cropping is a relay sowing method practiced primarily in southern India.\n2. Green manuring involves growing and incorporating leguminous plants into the soil to improve soil fertility.  Dhaincha is an example of a green manure crop.\n3. Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) focuses solely on the use of inorganic fertilizers to maximize crop yields.\n4.  Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is a government initiative that discourages sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Green manuring is a sustainable agricultural practice that uses leguminous plants to enhance soil fertility. Dhaincha is a commonly used green manure crop in India.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. PKVY (Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana) is a government initiative specifically designed to promote organic and sustainable farming practices.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Paira cropping, a relay sowing method, is primarily practiced in eastern and central India (Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha), not southern India.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. INM is a holistic approach that integrates organic, inorganic, and biological components to optimize soil fertility and plant nutrient supply, not solely relying on inorganic fertilizers.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding India's localized weather forecasting:\n\n1. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) currently forecasts weather events over a 1 km x 1 km area.\n2. CoS-it-FloWS is a government-run system collecting hyper-local data for flood forecasts in Kerala.\n3. Hyperlocal weather forecasting pinpoints weather conditions to extremely localized areas.\n4.  The IMD's goal is to eventually achieve hyper-local forecasts down to 1 km x 1 km areas.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Hyperlocal weather forecasting is a specialized approach focusing on very small geographical areas, offering highly detailed and precise weather information.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The IMD aims to improve its forecasting capabilities to provide hyper-local forecasts at a resolution of 1 km x 1 km, significantly enhancing accuracy and timeliness.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The IMD's current capability is for 12 km x 12 km areas, not 1 km x 1 km.  They are working towards achieving the higher resolution.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. CoS-it-FloWS is a project run by Equinoct, a Kochi-based community-sourced modelling solution provider, not a government-run system, though it collaborates with local communities.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding Ramsar sites in India:\n\n1. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries in Bihar are natural wetlands.\n2. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu is a large, deep wetland.\n3. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu lies on the Central Asian Flyway.\n4. Tawa Reservoir in Madhya Pradesh is located outside any protected area.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary is situated on the Central Asian Flyway, a major migratory route for birds. Its location makes it crucial for conservation efforts.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries are man-made reservoirs, not natural wetlands.  Their creation altered the landscape, impacting the local ecosystem.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Nanjarayan Lake is described as a large, *shallow* wetland, not deep. Its shallow nature influences its ecological characteristics.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Tawa Reservoir is located inside the Satpura Tiger Reserve and borders Satpura National Park and Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, placing it within a network of protected areas.\n\n\n8.  Consider the following regarding undersea features in the Indian Ocean:\n\n1.  The Ashok Seamount, Chandragupt Ridge, and Kalpataru Ridge are located along the Northwest Indian Ridge.\n2. The naming of undersea features outside territorial seas follows guidelines established by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).\n3.  The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research discovered these undersea features.\n4. The International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) is not involved in the naming process of undersea features.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The IHO's 2013 guidelines on \"Standardization of Undersea Feature Names\" provide a framework for naming undersea features outside territorial waters, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) is credited with discovering the Ashok Seamount, Chandragupt Ridge, and Kalpataru Ridge.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) collaborates with the IHO in the naming process of undersea features.  Both organizations play a role in reviewing and approving proposed names.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. These undersea features are located along the *Southwest* Indian Ridge, not the Northwest Indian Ridge.  The precise location is an important aspect of their identification and naming.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding Artificial Reefs:\n\n1. Artificial reefs are placed on the seabed with a random design to attract marine life.\n2.  The primary materials used for constructing artificial reefs are exclusively natural materials such as rocks and coral.\n3.  Artificial reefs aim to mimic the characteristics of a natural reef and enhance biodiversity.\n4. The Department of Fisheries is not involved in promoting the use of artificial reefs.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Artificial reefs are designed to mimic natural reefs, providing habitats for marine organisms and enhancing biodiversity.  This is a key objective of their deployment.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  Artificial reefs are placed with a *fixed scientific design*, not a random design, to optimize their effectiveness in attracting and supporting marine life.  The design is crucial for their success.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While rocks are used, many other materials, including cinder blocks, wood, old tires, limestone, steel, and concrete, are employed in constructing artificial reefs. The choice of material depends on several factors, including cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Department of Fisheries actively promotes the use of artificial reefs under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana to rejuvenate coastal fisheries.  This initiative highlights the government's support for this approach.\n\n\n10. Consider the following statements about organizations related to environmental protection in India:\n\n1. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a non-statutory body.\n2. The Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) deals exclusively with surface water resources.\n3. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) receives complaints and takes action on environmental issues.\n4. The Committee for Air Quality Management (CAQM) focuses solely on air quality issues in rural areas.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The NGT is a specialized tribunal that addresses environmental issues, receiving complaints and making orders to protect the environment.  Its role is crucial in enforcing environmental laws.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) is a *statutory* body, established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and empowered under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Its legal standing is fundamental to its functions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The CGWB (Central Groundwater Board) focuses on *groundwater* resources, not surface water.  The distinction between surface and groundwater management is important.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The CAQM (Committee for Air Quality Management) addresses air quality issues in both urban and rural areas, encompassing a broader geographical scope than just rural areas.\n"

The 'Early Warnings for All (EW4All)' initiative focuses solely on technological advancements in early warning systems, disregarding community participation.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics or functions of the mentioned mechanisms?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 3 and 4 are accurate. The R&R window within NDRF and SDRF specifically addresses funding needs for recovery and reconstruction after disasters.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; NDRF and SDRF also fund preparedness and capacity building. Statement 2 is also incorrect; parametric insurance pays out based on pre-defined parameters, regardless of actual losses. Finally, statement 4 is inaccurate; EW4All emphasizes community participation in building resilience. Therefore, only two statements are correct, making (b) the correct answer.  Other options misrepresent the accurate number of statements.\n\n\n6. Consider the following about environmental organizations and initiatives:\n\n1. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is a United Nations agency.\n2. The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme focuses solely on developing protected areas.\n3. The National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) Programme is run by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change.\n4. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) develops standards for corporate climate targets.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the nature or function of the mentioned organizations or initiatives?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  IDWH focuses on habitat development, including but not limited to protected areas. NICES is indeed operated by ISRO and the Department of Space, in collaboration with other ministries. SBTI correctly sets standards for corporate climate targets. However, statement 1 is incorrect; IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body, not a UN agency. Therefore, three statements accurately describe the organizations or initiatives, making (c) the correct answer. The other options misrepresent the number of accurate statements.\n"

It is irrelevant to the study of food webs.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the concept of Gape Limitation?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately depict Gape Limitation.  It's a fundamental ecological concept where a predator's mouth size (gape) directly limits the maximum size of prey it can successfully capture and consume. While body size is a major factor, it's not the *only* determinant; jaw structure and hunting techniques also play roles.  Gape limitation significantly shapes food webs, influencing species interactions, prey selection, and the overall structure of the ecosystem.  Statement 4 is incorrect; gape limitation is a crucial factor in understanding food web dynamics and energy flow.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the characteristics of Fungi:\n\n1. Fungi exclusively reproduce through spores.\n2. All fungi are single-celled organisms.\n3. Fungi are primarily autotrophic organisms.\n4. Fungi play a significant role in nutrient cycling.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of fungi?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is entirely accurate.  While spores are a common reproductive method for fungi, many also reproduce asexually through other means like budding or fragmentation. Fungi encompass a vast diversity, ranging from single-celled yeasts to complex multicellular mushrooms; therefore, statement 2 is false.  Fungi are heterotrophic, obtaining nutrients by absorbing organic matter; they are not autotrophic like plants.  Their role as decomposers is crucial for nutrient cycling in ecosystems, making statement 4 correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following concerning the Great Oxygenation Event:\n\n1. Stromatolites played a significant role in the Great Oxygenation Event.\n2. The Great Oxygenation Event drastically reduced atmospheric oxygen levels.\n3. The Great Oxygenation Event had minimal impact on the evolution of life on Earth.\n4. The Great Oxygenation Event primarily involved the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the Great Oxygenation Event?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. Stromatolites, microbial mats, were significant oxygen producers in early Earth's oceans, contributing substantially to the rise in atmospheric oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event.  The event dramatically *increased*, not reduced, atmospheric oxygen levels, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and paving the way for the evolution of aerobic life.  The event had a profound impact on life's evolution, leading to the extinction of many anaerobic organisms and the rise of oxygen-dependent life forms.  The event involved the release of oxygen, not carbon dioxide, as a byproduct of photosynthesis.\n\n\n5. Consider the following regarding environmental DNA (eDNA):\n\n1. eDNA is exclusively found in aquatic environments.\n2. eDNA analysis is expensive and unreliable.\n3. eDNA analysis can be used to assess biodiversity.\n4. eDNA is genetic material released by organisms into the environment.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe eDNA and its applications?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. eDNA is indeed genetic material shed by organisms into their surroundings (soil, water, air), and its analysis is a powerful tool for assessing biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  Statement 1 is incorrect; eDNA is found in various environments, not just aquatic ones.  Statement 2 is false; eDNA analysis is becoming increasingly cost-effective and reliable, offering a valuable alternative to traditional biodiversity assessment methods.\n\n\n6. Consider the following about Megafauna:\n\n1. Megafauna are defined solely by their weight.\n2. Megafauna classifications are based only on their habitat.\n3. Anthropogenic pressures have significantly impacted megafauna populations.\n4. Megafauna exclusively refers to extant species.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of megafauna?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is accurate. While weight is a primary criterion for defining megafauna (generally >50 kg), other factors are also considered.  Classifications are based on diet (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores) and not solely on habitat.  Anthropogenic pressures, such as habitat loss and hunting, have caused dramatic declines in many megafauna populations. Statement 4 is incorrect because megafauna includes both extant and extinct species.  The question uses misleading information to create difficulty.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about Plankton crashes:\n\n1. Plankton crashes are always caused by a lack of nutrients.\n2. Plankton crashes can occur due to changes in water quality.\n3. Plankton crashes are a natural and regular phenomenon.\n4. Plankton crashes have no impact on marine ecosystems.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the causes and consequences of plankton crashes?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 2 is correct. A sudden change in water quality (e.g., pollution, temperature fluctuations) can cause a plankton crash. While nutrient deficiency is a frequent cause, it's not the only one. Plankton crashes are not necessarily regular, and their impact on marine ecosystems can be substantial, affecting the entire food web.  Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible distractors increases the difficulty.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding Bioluminescence:\n\n1. Bioluminescence is found only in marine organisms.\n2. Bioluminescence requires luciferin and luciferase.\n3. Bioluminescence always emits blue light.\n4. Bioluminescence serves only as a defense mechanism.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe bioluminescence?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 2 is correct.  Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms and is found in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species, including fireflies, fungi, and various marine organisms.  The process typically involves luciferin (a light-emitting substrate) and luciferase (an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction).  The light emitted varies in color, not solely blue.  While defense is a common function, bioluminescence also serves other purposes, such as attracting prey or mates. The distractors aim to confuse the candidate with partially true statements.\n\n\n9.  Consider the following regarding the IUCN Red List:\n\n1. The IUCN Red List categorizes only animal species.\n2. The IUCN Red List is updated annually.\n3. The IUCN Red List provides information on species extinction risk.\n4. The IUCN Red List is solely based on population size.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is correct. The IUCN Red List assesses the extinction risk of both animal and plant species, including fungi. While the list is updated regularly, it's not necessarily done annually; updates occur as new data become available.  Extinction risk is determined by various factors beyond just population size, including habitat loss, threats, and population trends.  The other options include misleading information to increase the difficulty level of the question.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding the  World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR):\n\n1. The WNBR is managed by the UNEP.\n2. The WNBR includes sites from only developed countries.\n3. The WNBR aims to promote sustainable development.\n4. The WNBR only includes protected areas.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the WNBR?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is correct. The WNBR, under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), aims to integrate conservation of biodiversity with economic and social development. The UNEP is not involved in its management.  The network includes sites from diverse countries, both developed and developing.  While many biosphere reserves are protected areas, the network also includes sites with various management designations that promote sustainable practices. The other options are designed to be plausible but incorrect.\n"
