Statement 2 accurately describes the structure and calculation of the GEPI, highlighting its four pillars and the additive nature of its formula. However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While GEPI does quantify the economic contributions of natural ecosystems and assesses the impact of human activities, it indirectly contributes to measuring overall welfare by reflecting the health of the environment which directly impacts human well-being.  A healthy environment contributes to better human welfare, but GEPI itself doesn't directly measure welfare using specific metrics like happiness indices.\n"

These pollutants are transported via atmospheric and oceanic currents, accumulating in the Arctic region due to its cold temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns.  Reversing the direction of pollutant transport is a crucial error.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Atmospheric and oceanic currents are the primary drivers of the Grasshopper Effect. These currents carry pollutants over long distances, concentrating them in the Arctic, which acts as a \"hemispheric sink.\" This accumulation of pollutants poses significant environmental and health risks.  This accurately describes the physical mechanisms behind the Grasshopper Effect.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the report by ACAT and IPEN addresses the Grasshopper Effect, it focuses on broader impacts, including human health, human rights, and Indigenous lands, not solely on marine ecosystems.  Oversimplifying the report's scope misrepresents the extent of its findings.  The statement incorrectly limits the report's focus to marine ecosystems, ignoring other crucial aspects.\n"

However, it's not solely caused by high tides; the primary cause is swell waves generated by distant storms. High tides can exacerbate the flooding but are not the primary driver.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The description of swell waves and their generation by distant weather systems aligns perfectly with the information provided.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A key characteristic of swell waves is that they can propagate in directions different from the wind that generated them. This is because swell waves are essentially free-running waves that continue moving even after the generating wind has subsided or changed direction. This makes forecasting slightly more complex than if the waves only moved with the wind.\n"

The Biological Diversity Act (2002) provides the statutory framework, and the BMC's involvement ensures the inclusion of local knowledge and perspectives, a crucial aspect for effective conservation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While medicinal uses are a significant part of the information documented in PBRs, they also encompass a much broader range of traditional knowledge related to local biological resources, including their cultural significance, culinary uses, and other applications.  This broader scope is important for understanding the multifaceted relationship between communities and their biodiversity.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While PBRs can certainly support claims of local ownership of biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge, their relevance extends significantly beyond this. They play a crucial role in enabling sustainable resource management by providing a comprehensive inventory of local biological resources and their uses, informing conservation and development planning.  This aspect aligns with the broader goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, often emphasized in UPSC examinations.\n\n"

While cooler sea surface temperatures can inhibit cyclone formation, the statement misrepresents the moisture conditions. The Arabian Sea does receive moisture, albeit perhaps less than the Bay of Bengal.  The statement incorrectly suggests that limited moisture from the Arabian Peninsula is a primary factor preventing cyclone formation in the western Arabian Sea.  Other factors, such as wind shear and atmospheric stability, play a more significant role.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.

The movement's leadership included prominent figures like Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, but its strength lay in the collective mobilization of women.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Eco-feminism, a philosophy connecting ecological concerns with women's experiences and perspectives, is central to understanding the Chipko movement's success.

The Bishnoi community's historical resistance against deforestation provides a crucial antecedent to the modern Chipko movement, highlighting a long-standing tradition of environmental protection.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Chipko movement undoubtedly influenced forest conservation, it did not directly lead to a royal decree banning tree felling in all Bishnoi villages. The Bishnoi community's resistance in the 18th century resulted in such a decree within their own communities, but the impact of the Chipko movement was broader, influencing environmental policies and awareness nationally and internationally.  The movement's success lies in its powerful demonstration of people's power and its impact on environmental awareness.\n"

Kallakkadal can occur during the pre-monsoon (April-May) or post-monsoon seasons. It is not confined solely to the main monsoon period.  The timing depends on the presence of distant weather systems capable of generating the necessary swell waves.\n"

Statement 1 is incorrect as the movement's origins are much earlier than the 20th century.  Statement 3 is incorrect as while women played a crucial role, the Chipko movement involved men as well and extended beyond Reni village.  The Bishnoi community's historical commitment to environmental protection, exemplified by Amrita Devi's sacrifice, provides a crucial historical context for understanding the Chipko movement's philosophy and its legacy. This highlights the long-standing indigenous environmental conservation practices in India.\n"

Higher ocean temperatures increase the rate of evaporation, providing more moisture to the atmosphere, which strengthens the storm. This is a well-established effect of climate change on tropical cyclones globally, including Southeast Asia.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct:  Warmer temperatures also lead to increased atmospheric moisture, which can cause cyclones to persist longer over land.  The increased moisture content prolongs the storm's lifespan by providing a continuous supply of fuel for the system.  This extended duration increases the potential for devastating impacts on coastal communities.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect: The Coriolis effect, while influencing cyclone formation and rotation, is not primarily responsible for cyclones forming closer to coasts.  The proximity of cyclone formation to the coast is more accurately attributed to changes in atmospheric pressure patterns and wind systems influenced by warming SSTs.  Changes in wind patterns and ocean currents, driven by climate change, can shift the locations where cyclones form and intensify.\n"

The statement incorrectly reverses the effect of soil acidification on pH.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The leaching of nitrogen from ammonium-based fertilizers and the release of organic acids during the decomposition of organic matter are well-established contributors to soil acidification.  These processes contribute to the lowering of soil pH.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Liming is a common practice to counteract soil acidification by raising the pH. The utilization of industrial by-products like press mud offers a sustainable approach to soil amendment.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 correctly describe aspects of soil acidification and its management.\n"

The scoring system is based on a complex weighting of various indicators related to the SDGs, not simply a percentage of targets met. The score of 100 indicates that the state/UT has achieved all the targets set for 2030.  The index uses a composite score to reflect overall progress, rather than a simple percentage.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. States achieving a score of 100 are categorized as \"Achievers,\" not \"Front Runners.\" The \"Front Runners\" category encompasses states with scores between 65 and 99, indicating significant progress but not yet full achievement of all targets.

The water can originate from various sources, including melting snow and ice on the volcano's slopes, rainfall, or even the eruption of a crater lake. The combination of water and volcanic material creates a fluid, highly destructive flow.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While geothermal heat from the volcano contributes to the high temperature of a lahar, it's not the sole factor.  Chemical reactions within the volcanic material itself, such as the oxidation of pyroclastic debris, also generate considerable heat.  This exothermic process significantly contributes to the lahar's temperature, often keeping it hot for a considerable duration after its initiation.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Lahars are extremely dangerous natural hazards. Their speed and destructive power make them a severe threat to human life and infrastructure in areas downstream of active volcanoes. The high volume of debris and sediment carried by lahars can bury entire towns and destroy bridges, roads, and other infrastructure.  Effective disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies, including early warning systems and evacuation plans, are crucial in minimizing the impact of lahars.\n"

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  The GFC Fund was established during the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), not the fourth. This detail is important for understanding the historical context and timeline of the Fund's creation.  The correct ICCM number is crucial for accuracy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The GFC Fund specifically targets medium-scale projects in low- and middle-income countries, including small island developing states. This focus is a central part of its mandate, emphasizing support for nations with limited resources and greater vulnerability to chemical hazards.  The statement misrepresents the fund's target beneficiaries and project scale.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Executive Board of the GFC Fund does indeed include representatives from all UN regions and donor countries. This composition ensures broad geographical representation and stakeholder involvement in the Fund's governance and decision-making processes.  The inclusive nature of the board is essential for the fund's legitimacy and effectiveness.\n"

        "question_text": "With reference to Geothermal Energy in India, consider the following statements:**\n\n1.  India's geothermal power potential has been identified as exceeding 12,000 MW.\n2. The Renewable Energy Research & Technology Development Programme (RE-RTD) provides 100% financial support to all entities, including private companies, for geothermal projects.\n3.  Potential issues with geothermal energy include land subsidence and the release of toxic chemicals.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "option_b": "3 only\n",
        "option_c": "2 and 3 only\n",
        "option_d": "1, 2, and 3\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The identified geothermal power potential in India is 10,600 MW, not exceeding 12,000 MW. This difference in the magnitude of potential impacts the assessment of the country's renewable energy resources. The precise figure is critical for accurate planning and investment decisions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the RE-RTD does provide 100% financial support to government and non-profit research organizations, it provides up to 70% support to the industry and startups, not 100%. The funding structure is crucial for understanding the government's approach to supporting the development of geothermal energy.  The difference in funding percentages significantly impacts investment strategies.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Land subsidence and the release of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony are indeed potential issues associated with geothermal energy extraction and utilization.  These environmental concerns are critical considerations in the responsible development of geothermal resources.  Understanding the potential risks is vital for risk mitigation strategies and ensuring sustainable development.\n"

This chronological detail is crucial for understanding the framework's place in the broader evolution of international disaster risk reduction efforts.  The correct conference number is essential for accuracy.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Sendai Framework does indeed prioritize substantially increasing the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies. This focus on strengthening governance and institutional capacity is fundamental to the framework's effectiveness.  The aim reflects a strategic approach to building national resilience.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct. The Sendai Framework explicitly aims to substantially reduce global disaster mortality, the number of affected people, and economic losses relative to GDP.  These measurable targets are vital for monitoring progress and evaluating the framework's impact.  The targets reflect the framework's ambition to significantly reduce the human and economic costs of disasters.\n\n"
