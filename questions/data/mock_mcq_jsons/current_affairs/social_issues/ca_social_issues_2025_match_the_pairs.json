        "explanation": "\n\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a comprehensive international treaty focused on promoting and protecting the rights of people with disabilities.  The primary objective of the UN-CRPD is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, as stated in the first pair.  The convention defines persons with disabilities inclusively, encompassing those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, which is accurately reflected in the second pair.  Finally, the Incheon Strategy, aimed at making the rights of persons with disabilities real, is directly related to and supportive of the UN-CRPD, correctly matched in the third pair.  All three pairs accurately represent key aspects of the UN-CRPD and its associated initiatives.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incomplete and fail to capture the comprehensive nature of the UN-CRPD's scope and objectives.  Understanding the key provisions and related international initiatives is crucial for assessing the impact and effectiveness of the convention.\n"

The NEP 2020 indeed established the National Research Foundation (NRF).  Pair 3 is incorrect because the creation of a coordinating financial mechanism is related to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, not the National Anti-Doping Act. Pair 4 is incorrect; multiple exit options are a feature of the NEP 2020, not the IHR amendments.

Option 1 is thus correct.\n\nThe Asmita Project aims to augment study materials in Indian languages through translation and academic writing.  While it involves the creation of a multilingual dictionary repository and the use of technology to enhance translation, its core focus is on providing high-quality study materials in native languages. Option 2 is therefore incorrectly matched with real-time translation architecture as the primary objective.  The real-time translation architecture is a component of a broader initiative to promote multilingualism in education, but is not the defining feature of Asmita.\n\nProject NAMAN, launched by the Indian Army, accurately targets providing dedicated support and services to defence pensioners, veterans, and their families through the SPARSH system.

        "option_d": "1 and 3 only\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because only the pairing of ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) with its key feature of establishing world-class research centers is accurate.  PAIR's core function is to pair universities for mentorship, not specifically focus on EV mobility and solar cells research, although these are areas *potentially* covered under the program's broader scope. MAHA's aim is to support solution-focused research in priority areas, which includes, but is not limited to,  EV mobility and solar cells.  The question uses specific, potentially misleading details within the distractors (PAIR and MAHA) to test the candidate's precise understanding of ANRF's initiatives and avoid superficial comprehension.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect pairings based on partial or inaccurate interpretations of the initiatives' descriptions. The question effectively tests the ability to distinguish between the core objectives and the potential applications of the ANRF initiatives.\n"

Option (b) is incorrect because it includes pair 2, which is factually incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes pair 3, which is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of legal provisions related to women's rights and reproductive health, requiring precise understanding of the scope and limitations of different laws. It highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework surrounding crucial social issues.\n"

This question tests the understanding of specific legislative and policy details, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of legal frameworks and their implementations.

This modification did not overturn the legality of passive euthanasia but rather refined the process. Thus, pair 3 is also correct.

While India's ranking is mentioned in relation to gender inequality, the specific ranking of 108th is associated with the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, not the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) from the same year.  The GGGI and GII are different indices measuring different aspects of gender equality.\n\nOption 2 is incorrect. Iceland consistently ranks highly in gender equality indices, but the statement incorrectly assigns it the top position in the GII. Iceland's top ranking is typically associated with the Global Gender Gap Report.\n\nOption 4 is incorrect.  Denmark's high ranking is usually associated with indices like the Gender Inequality Index (GII) or the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), not the University Impact Rankings.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, encompassing various aspects like infrastructure development, health, education, and livelihood enhancement.  While skill development is a component, it's not the *primary* objective.  The Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) is a crucial funding mechanism for tribal welfare initiatives, providing financial resources for various programs aimed at improving the lives of Scheduled Tribes.  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) focuses on providing pucca houses to eligible rural households, including those belonging to Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct option. Option (a) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's primary focus is broader than just skill development. Option (c) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's primary objective encompasses more than just housing.\n"

Multiple line ministries are involved in its implementation.\n\n3. **PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin):**  The scheme explicitly aims to provide pucca houses *with* access to tapped water and electricity supply, aligning with Jal Jeevan Mission and electricity provisions.\n\n4. **National Health Mission:** The National Health Mission *does* utilize mobile medical units to enhance immunization coverage in areas lacking easy access to sub-centers, especially in remote and hilly regions.\n\n5. **Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan:** This Abhiyan encompasses education at all levels, from primary to secondary and even vocational training, not limiting itself to only higher education for Scheduled Tribes.\n"

This was a crucial addition to the IHR framework, acknowledging the significant financial burden placed on nations, especially those with less robust healthcare systems, during public health emergencies.  Option 1 is incorrect because defining a pandemic emergency and establishing a States Parties Committee are distinct amendments. While both relate to improving pandemic preparedness and response, they are not directly linked in a paired manner.  Option 3 incorrectly pairs the creation of National IHR Authorities with the IHR's origins. The creation of national authorities is a modern addition to enhance coordination, while the IHR's origins are in the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951.  Option (d) is incorrect as at least one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the IHR amendments.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), a partnership that includes the World Food Programme (WFP).  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 is jointly released by five UN agencies, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the GRFC and the Food Waste Index Report. Option (a) is too narrow, and options (c) and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP; hence, pair 4 is incorrect. This illustrates the importance of precise knowledge of organizations associated with specific reports and indices, a crucial aspect of UPSC preparation.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe National Policy for PwDs, 2006, while encompassing various aspects of PwD welfare, notably included a provision for 5% reservation in government jobs.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), significantly broadened the rights of PwDs, including the right to free education for children aged 6 to 18 years. The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, focuses on the regulation and standardization of rehabilitation professionals and services, not directly on establishing limited guardianship (though it indirectly supports the concept). The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) initiated in 2015 aimed to make public spaces accessible to PwDs, and while it doesn't directly mandate private sector incentives, government initiatives often indirectly encourage private sector participation in inclusive practices.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, doesn't directly establish limited guardianship. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete as they exclude correctly matched pairs.\n"

The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism was a key part of the amendments to address the needs of developing countries.  Creating National IHR Authorities was another crucial amendment to improve coordination, but it is not directly linked to defining a pandemic emergency. The IHR (2005) itself is the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951), not a feature of a specific amendment. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme aims to improve the status of girls and women, including preventing child marriages. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, deals with the care and protection of children in conflict with the law and those in need of care and protection, thus indirectly addressing child marriages. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits child labour.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the PWDVA with raising the marriage age (which is a separate policy objective).

The UGC's draft guidelines for RPL are focused on formalizing the recognition of prior learning. The ABC is explicitly designed for the digital storage of academic credits earned from various institutions. FHEIs operating in India, under the NEP's framework, award degrees under the name and seal of their origin institution.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pairs related to ABC and FHEI. Option (c) is also incorrect, similarly omitting the RPL aspect.

The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced relationship between DNTs, nomadic tribes, and the historical context of the Criminal Tribes Act.

Iceland consistently ranks high, often achieving the top position, reflecting its strong commitment to gender equality.  Norway and Finland are also consistently among the top-ranked countries in the Global Gender Gap Index.  The 2024 report shows Iceland in the top position. The India's ranking in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is 129th.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII), published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), measures gender inequalities across different dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and economic opportunity. Denmark and Norway frequently feature among the top-ranked countries in the GII. The 2022 report placed India at 108. Bhutan is correctly listed as a South Asian country that outperforms India in the Global Gender Gap Report, 2024. Thus, all pairs are correctly matched.\n"
