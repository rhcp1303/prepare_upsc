The WHO focuses on public health, the ILO on labor standards, and the World Bank on global finance; none have the specific mandate of the UN-CRPD related to disability rights. The UN's involvement underscores its commitment to human rights globally and its role in setting international standards for disability inclusion.  The convention's adoption and subsequent ratification by numerous countries demonstrate a significant shift towards a more rights-based and inclusive approach to disability.

The report indicated that while India's GHI score has improved since 2000, it still falls under the \"serious\" category, highlighting the persistent challenge of hunger and malnutrition.  The report specifically pointed out the alarmingly high rates of child wasting (over 18.7%) and stunting (over 35.5%) among children under five. This persistent challenge underscores the need for continued and strengthened interventions to address these critical nutritional deficiencies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they contradict the report's findings.  Option (a) is false because while there was improvement, it wasn't significant enough to move India out of the \"serious\" category. Option (b) is incorrect because India ranked 105th out of 127 countries, far from the top 25. Option (d) is incorrect because the report explicitly stated that child wasting and stunting remain very high.  The persistent high rates of malnutrition in children highlight the complex interplay of factors contributing to food insecurity in India, including poverty, inequitable access to resources, and the impact of climate change.\n"

The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a pivotal moment, where the Supreme Court of India, for the first time, recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under strict guidelines. This was further solidified by the Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. (2018) case, which reaffirmed the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21 and upheld the legal validity of passive euthanasia. The Vishaka case dealt with sexual harassment, while the Justice J.S. Verma Committee focused on criminal law reforms, neither directly addressing euthanasia.  The significance of these two cases lies in their establishment of a legal framework for passive euthanasia, allowing individuals to refuse life-sustaining treatment under specific circumstances.  This reflects a crucial intersection of legal and medical ethics in modern India.  The ruling underscores the importance of respecting individual autonomy and the right to a dignified death, even when it involves foregoing life-sustaining treatment.  The Supreme Court's careful consideration of the ethical and legal implications in these cases sets a precedent for future considerations of end-of-life care."

This right recognizes the traditional and customary use of forest lands by these groups.  While the FRA indirectly contributes to other rights like education, healthcare, and food security through improved livelihoods and access to resources, the specific right directly conferred by the FRA to PVTGs is the right to their habitat.  The FRA's recognition of habitat rights is a critical step towards ensuring the survival and well-being of PVTGs, who often have a deep dependence on forest ecosystems.  This is a significant departure from previous policies that often overlooked or marginalized the claims of forest-dwelling communities.\n"
