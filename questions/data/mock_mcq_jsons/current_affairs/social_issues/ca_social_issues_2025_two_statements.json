The convention focuses on inclusive participation and non-discrimination, leaving the specifics of implementation to individual nations.  The 4% reservation in government jobs mentioned in the source pertains to Indian policy, not the UN-CRPD.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The UN-CRPD's definition of persons with disabilities aligns with the description provided, encompassing long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.  The source correctly identifies India as one of the 164 signatories to this convention.  This statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the convention's scope and India's participation.\n"

Appeals against preliminary assessment orders of the JJB for heinous offences are to be filed before the Children's Court, not the Sessions Court, wherever a Children's Court is available.  This highlights the specialized nature of juvenile justice and the need for courts with expertise in handling such cases.  The specified court for appeals is critical for ensuring the correct judicial process.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of Child Care Leave (CCL) and its constitutional implications, the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 does not itself contain provisions for CCL.  CCL is typically governed by separate rules and regulations within the government's employment framework.  Confusing the two distinct legal domains is a common misconception.  The Juvenile Justice Act focuses on the care and protection of children in conflict with the law and those in need of care and protection, whereas CCL is a leave entitlement for employees.\n"

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, indeed includes provisions (Sections 85 and 86) addressing cruelty towards married women.  These provisions effectively replace Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which previously addressed similar issues.  The shift to the new code represents a legislative change in how domestic violence cases are handled, consolidating provisions within a new legal framework.  The replacement of Section 498A is a key development in the evolution of domestic violence laws.\n"

The broader criteria reflect the complexities of medical decision-making in such situations.  Restricting the exception to rape alone would be an oversimplification.  The inclusion of foetal abnormalities acknowledges the ethical considerations surrounding severe health conditions in the unborn child.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Act does indeed delineate the gestational period for abortion based on the number of doctors' opinions.  A single Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) opinion suffices up to 20 weeks, while two RMP opinions are required for abortions between 20 and 24 weeks.  This tiered approach reflects a risk-based assessment and ensures that decisions are made with appropriate medical oversight.  The graduated scale based on the number of medical opinions is a key element of the Act's structure.\n"

This is achieved by providing various forms of financial assistance, including capitalization support (Revolving Fund and Community Investment Fund), collateral-free bank loans, interest subvention, and access to overdraft facilities.

The 'Lakhpati Didi' title is not simply awarded to any woman who is a member of an SHG.  To qualify, a woman must demonstrate a sustained annual household income of at least Rs. 1 lakh (calculated over at least four agricultural seasons or business cycles), indicating significant economic progress and entrepreneurial success.  The title serves as recognition for those who have achieved substantial economic empowerment through their participation in SHGs.

This ranking system uniquely evaluates universities not just on traditional academic metrics but also on their contributions towards achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The rankings consider a university's impact across various SDGs, reflecting its commitment to broader societal benefit and global challenges.  This approach distinguishes it from rankings focusing solely on research output or academic reputation.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While India had a strong showing with 96 institutions featured in the overall table, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham secured the top position among Indian universities in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  IISc Bangalore, while a prestigious institution, achieved a different rank in this specific ranking.  The University Impact Rankings use a different methodology than other university rankings, focusing on the impact of the university's activities on the SDGs, which can lead to different outcomes compared to rankings based primarily on research and teaching.  Therefore, attributing the top rank to IISc Bangalore is factually incorrect.\n"

IIT Madras, while a top-ranked institution, topped the overall category, but IISC Bangalore held the top spot specifically within the \"Universities\" category.  The distinction between overall rankings and category-specific rankings is crucial for understanding the results accurately.

While India's ranking did improve from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024,  it still falls under the \"serious\" category of hunger severity, not \"low.\"  Furthermore, the report indicated that child wasting (18.7%) and stunting (35.5%) rates remain significantly high in India, contradicting the claim of substantial decline. The improvement in the ranking is marginal and doesn't represent a significant shift in the overall severity of hunger in the country.

While the ANRF aims to attract significant private sector investment (\u20b936,000 crore out of a total \u20b950,000 crore budget for 2023-2028),  it is not *entirely* funded by private sources.  A substantial portion (\u20b914,000 crore) comes from the Central Government.  The question attempts to create confusion by exaggerating the private sector's role.  Understanding the balance between public and private funding is key to comprehending the ANRF's financial model and its implications for research independence.\n\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, explicitly incorporating the former SERB under its umbrella.  Its administrative oversight rests with the Department of Science and Technology (DST), a crucial element of its governance structure.  This point highlights the government's commitment to supporting and directing national research efforts through established institutional mechanisms.  The question's distractor might lie in the candidate's familiarity with SERB without linking it to ANRF's current structure.\n"

The GII score ranges from 0 (complete gender equality) to 1 (maximum gender inequality).  Therefore, a lower score indicates better gender equality outcomes.  Understanding this inverse relationship is crucial for interpreting the GII data.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  India's ranking in the 2022 GII did *not* improve considerably compared to the previous year. Although there was some improvement, it was not a significant leap. The report provides the specific ranking numbers for both years, demonstrating a modest change but not a substantial advancement.

The \"Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)\" Scheme indeed provides 100% central assistance, encompassing both grants-in-aid and capital asset creation. Crucially, this assistance explicitly extends to supporting various activities including education and housing, which are vital for the overall well-being and development of PVTG communities.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The scheme explicitly aims for comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage.  Furthermore, it actively focuses on strengthening infrastructure and providing social security measures. These elements are integral to the scheme's holistic approach to uplift PVTG communities, ensuring not only economic progress but also improved living standards and social protection.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  PM-JUGA's core objective is to address deficiencies in social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities.  It achieves this through a convergence approach, utilizing and coordinating existing government schemes rather than creating entirely new funding streams.  The emphasis is on integrated and efficient resource allocation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA has a five-year tenure (2024-25 to 2028-29) and aims to benefit over 5 crore tribal people across approximately 63,000 villages, its funding mechanism is crucial.  The scheme leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. It does not involve the creation of entirely new, specifically allocated central grants solely for PM-JUGA. This detail distinguishes it from other schemes which might receive dedicated new funding. The use of existing funds showcases a focus on efficient resource utilization and avoids unnecessary bureaucratic processes.\n"

While NHATS does prepare the estimates with guidance from the steering committee and expert groups, the System of Health Accounts used is the 2011 version, not the 2002 version. The year 2002 is relevant as it marks the inception of the NHA within the National Health Policy, but the actual accounting framework used is the updated 2011 version, reflecting methodological advancements and a more refined approach to data collection and analysis within the healthcare system.  The updated framework ensures greater accuracy and comparability with international standards.\n"

This is a cornerstone of international human rights law.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD defines persons with disabilities as those having \"long-term\" physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, which substantially limit their ability to participate fully in society.  The use of \"short-term\" is a crucial error that significantly alters the meaning and scope of the definition.
