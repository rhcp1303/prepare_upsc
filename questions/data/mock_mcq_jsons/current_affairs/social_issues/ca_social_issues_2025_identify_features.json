Goal 5 (increasing GER) aligns with the Abhiyan's focus on improving education and aligns with the overall aim of socio-economic upliftment for tribal communities. However, while education is a key component,  it's not explicitly listed as an independent goal in the same way as the others. Thus, while education is implicitly a goal, the question focuses on explicitly stated goals. This makes options (a) and (b) incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because, while related, the education aspect is not listed as a separate, independent goal with the same prominence as the other four.

While external/donor funding includes assistance from international entities, it doesn't encompass *all* funding received by the country.  It specifically refers to aid and grants specifically earmarked for healthcare from external sources, not all foreign investment or trade related to healthcare products or services.

Habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n",
        "option_a": "Only one ",
        "option_b": "Only two ",
        "option_c": "Only three ",
        "option_d": "All four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. One of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is a *stagnant or declining* population, not a growing one.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central financial assistance.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Habitat rights are explicitly provided for PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.\n\n\nThese MCQs test factual recall, analysis, and the ability to identify correct information amidst plausible distractors, aligning with the demands of the UPSC exam.  The explanations provide a deeper understanding of the concepts involved, aiding in knowledge retention and application.\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements about the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024:\n\n1.  The GHI is jointly released by Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welthungerhilfe (Germany).\n2.  The report highlights a correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger levels.\n3.  India's GHI score improved in 2024 compared to 2023, placing it in the \"serious\" category.\n4.  The report indicates that a significant percentage of Indian children under five suffer from both wasting and stunting.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate based on the GHI 2024 report?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately reflect findings from the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the two organizations responsible for publishing the index.  Statement 2 accurately points to the report's emphasis on the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger. Statement 3 is correct in noting India's improved ranking but its continued placement within the \"serious\" category.  Finally, statement 4 correctly reflects the high rates of child wasting and stunting reported in India.  These are key findings highlighted in the report, demonstrating the persistent challenges related to malnutrition and food security.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the four statements.  The options provided are designed to test precise knowledge of the report's key findings.\n\n\n2. Consider the following initiatives aimed at tackling hunger in India:\n\n1.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)\n2.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana\n3.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0\n4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013\n\nHow many of these initiatives specifically focus on providing supplementary nutrition or food assistance to vulnerable populations?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, establishes the right to food, its implementation involves various mechanisms.  PMGKAY, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, and PMMVY directly address supplementary nutrition or food assistance.  PMGKAY provides free food grains, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to bridge nutritional gaps, and PMMVY offers financial support and nutritious food to mothers.  Therefore, three out of the four initiatives primarily focus on providing supplementary nutrition or direct food assistance to vulnerable groups.  Option (c) accurately reflects this.  The distractor options play on the broader implications of the NFSA, which, while vital, is not solely focused on direct supplementary nutrition in the same way as the other three listed programs.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024:\n\n1.  NIRF was launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education.\n2.  The NIRF framework uses five parameters for ranking educational institutions.\n3.  The 2024 rankings included new categories for Open Universities and State Public Universities.\n4.  The Indian Institute of Science (IISC) Bangalore topped the overall category.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct about the NIRF 2024 rankings?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate descriptions of the NIRF 2024 rankings.  NIRF was indeed launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education. The framework consistently employs five parameters (Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception) for its rankings. The 2024 edition notably introduced new categories, including those mentioned for Open Universities and State Public Universities. However, statement 4 is incorrect; IIT Madras, not IISc Bangalore, topped the overall category in NIRF 2024. IISc Bangalore consistently tops the Universities category, but not the overall category.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct, making option (a) the accurate response.  The distractors are created to test precise recall of the ranking results.\n\n\n4. Consider the following statements concerning the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF):\n\n1.  ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023.\n2.  The ANRF aims to foster a culture of research and innovation across India.\n3.  The ANRF's funding is solely sourced from the Department of Science and Technology (DST).\n4.  The Prime Minister chairs the ANRF's Governing Board.\n\nWhich statements accurately reflect aspects of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  ANRF's establishment is indeed mandated by the ANRF Act 2023.  Its core objective is to promote research and innovation nationwide.  The Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board. However, statement 3 is incorrect; ANRF's funding is not solely from the DST. It involves a significant contribution from the Centre but also includes substantial private sector funding, a crucial aspect of its financial structure.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly represent aspects of the ANRF.  Option (b) is the correct answer. The distractors focus on the specific details of ANRF's funding mechanism.\n\n\n5. Consider the following about the  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:\n\n1. The regulations aim to facilitate the entry of top-ranked foreign universities into India.\n2.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked within the global top 500 to qualify.\n3. The University Grants Commission (UGC) grants final approval after campus setup.\n4. Only one FHEI can establish a campus in India under these regulations.\n\nWhich statements are correct regarding the UGC regulations for foreign university campuses in India?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 2 and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the UGC regulations.  The regulations aim to bring high-ranking foreign universities to India, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020's vision.  The top 500 global ranking criterion is a key eligibility requirement. However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The UGC initially provides in-principle approval and a Letter of Intent (LoI); final approval comes after the campus is established, and the regulations allow for collaborations between multiple FHEIs, provided each meets the criteria individually.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option (a) the accurate choice.  The distractors focus on the nuances of the approval process and collaborative possibilities under the regulations.\n\n\n6. Consider the following concerning the  'eShram portal':\n\n1. The eShram portal requires specific income criteria for registration.\n2.  The portal provides a Universal Account Number (UAN) that remains unchanged.\n3.  The eShram portal is exclusively for organized sector workers.\n4. The portal facilitates social security benefits for unorganized workers.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describes features of the eShram portal?\n\n(a) 2 and 4 only\n(b) 1 and 3 only\n(c) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2 and 4 are correct. The eShram portal assigns a unique and persistent UAN to each registered worker.  A primary goal of the eShram portal is to extend social security benefits to unorganized workers.  However, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. There are no income criteria for registration on the eShram portal; it's designed for all unorganized workers, not just those in the organized sector. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately describe the eShram portal's features. Option (a) is the correct answer. The distractors attempt to mislead by focusing on the eligibility criteria and the target workforce of the portal.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about the  'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme:\n\n1. The scheme provides 100% central assistance in the form of grants and capital asset creation.\n2.  The scheme prioritizes the socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture.\n3.  The scheme's funding is entirely derived from state-level budgets.\n4. Odisha houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs in India.\n\nWhich statements correctly describe the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the PVTG scheme.  It does provide 100% central funding through grants and capital asset creation.  The scheme's core aim is socio-economic development while respecting cultural heritage.  Odisha indeed has the highest number of recognized PVTGs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the scheme's funding is not solely from state budgets. It is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making (b) the accurate choice. The distractors focus on the funding source and the geographic distribution of PVTGs.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding the  PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Vikas Abhiyan):\n\n1. PM-JUGA aims to benefit over 5 crore tribal people across approximately 63,000 villages.\n2.  The Abhiyan's interventions are implemented solely by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n3.  PM-JUGA includes initiatives for skill development and entrepreneurship promotion.\n4.  The Abhiyan's progress is monitored using the PM Gati Shakti Portal.\n\nWhich statements correctly describe aspects of the PM-JUGA initiative?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect PM-JUGA.  The Abhiyan's target is indeed over 5 crore tribal people across approximately 63,000 villages.  It includes provisions for skill development and entrepreneurship.  Monitoring is done through the PM Gati Shakti Portal.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; PM-JUGA's interventions involve multiple line ministries, not solely the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct, making (b) the right answer.  The distractors focus on the number of participating ministries and the monitoring mechanism of the Abhiyan.\n\n\n9. Consider the following statements about the  Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006:\n\n1. Habitat rights are granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA.\n2.  The FRA defines \u2018habitat\u2019 as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.\n3.  The granting of habitat rights involves consultations with various stakeholders.\n4.  Habitat rights are automatically granted to all forest-dwelling communities.\n\nWhich statements are accurate regarding Habitat Rights under the FRA?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the provisions related to Habitat Rights under the FRA.  The legal basis for granting these rights is indeed Section 3(1)(e).  The FRA's definition of 'habitat' includes customary and other relevant habitats within protected forests.  Stakeholder consultations are a crucial part of the process.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; habitat rights are not automatically granted to all forest-dwelling communities; they are granted to specific eligible groups after a process of verification and consultation.  Thus, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The distractors play on the automatic nature of the right and the eligibility criteria.\n\n\n10. Consider the following about the  Food Waste Index Report 2024:\n\n1. The FWI tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels globally and nationally.\n2.  The FWI supports the achievement of SDG 12.3 by 2030.\n3. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the FWI.\n4. The report indicates that food waste contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhich statements accurately reflect the findings and objectives of the Food Waste Index Report 2024?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 accurately represent the FWI report.  It does track food waste at retail and consumer levels.  It directly contributes to achieving SDG 12.3 targets.  The report highlights the significant contribution of food waste to greenhouse gas emissions.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), not the FAO, is the custodian of the FWI.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making (b) the accurate choice.  The distractors focus on the custodian of the index and the specific aspects of the report's findings.\n\n"

Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct as the FWI supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels. The UNEP, not the FAO, is the custodian of the FWI; hence statement 3 is incorrect.

It's a part of a broader goal. Therefore, statement 1 is not entirely accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect; PM-JAY's funding model involves a collaborative effort between the central and state governments. Statement 3 is partially correct; the use of Mobile Medical Units for immunization is a component of National Health Mission, which overlaps with some of PM-JAY's goals but isn't directly managed under PM-JAY.  Statement 4 is correct; reducing IMR and MMR are key objectives of PM-JAY.  Hence, only statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect aspects of PM-JAY.\n\n\n5. Consider the following about the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):\n\n1.  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations solely determine PVTG status.\n2.  Habitat rights for PVTGs are defined under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.\n3.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs.\n4.  The \"Development of PVTGs\" scheme emphasizes assimilation into mainstream society.\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of PVTGs and related policies?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile the Dhebar Committee's recommendations are crucial, other factors also influence PVTG identification. Thus, statement 1 is not entirely accurate. Statement 2 is correct; the Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly defines habitat rights for PVTGs. Statement 3 is also correct; Odisha indeed has the highest number of recognized PVTGs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the \"Development of PVTGs\" scheme aims to promote their socio-economic development while preserving their culture and heritage, not assimilation.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate.\n\n\n6. Consider the following related to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024:\n\n1.  The GHI is published by the World Food Programme (WFP).\n2.  The GHI report highlights the link between gender inequality and hunger.\n3.  India's GHI score improved in 2024 compared to 2023.\n4.  The GHI uses a severity scale ranging from \"low\" to \"extremely alarming\".\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate representations of the GHI 2024?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe GHI is jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not solely the WFP.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; the GHI report consistently emphasizes the connection between gender inequality and higher levels of hunger. Statement 3 is also correct; India's ranking improved in the 2024 GHI report compared to the previous year. While the scale is categorical, it ranges from \"low\" to \"alarming\" and \"extremely alarming\", not simply \"low\" to \"extremely alarming\". Therefore, statement 4 requires correction.  Hence, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024:\n\n1. NIRF rankings include \"Innovation\" as a ranking parameter.\n2. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the implementing agency for NIRF.\n3.  NIRF 2024 introduced rankings for Skill Universities.\n4.  The NIRF methodology uses only quantitative data for institutional ranking.\n\nHow many of the statements above correctly describe aspects of the NIRF 2024 rankings?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the NIRF framework now integrates \"Innovation\" as a ranking parameter. Statement 2 is also correct; the NBA, in collaboration with INFLIBNET, implements the NIRF rankings. Statement 3 is accurate; NIRF 2024 indeed introduced new categories, including Skill Universities. Statement 4 is incorrect; NIRF uses both quantitative and qualitative parameters for its ranking methodology. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of NIRF 2024.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements regarding the  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:\n\n1.  The regulations aim to restrict the entry of foreign universities into India.\n2.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked in the global top 500 to be eligible.\n3.  The regulations allow for collaboration between multiple FHEIs to set up campuses in India.\n4.  The UGC grants final approval for FHEI campuses after a detailed on-site inspection.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the 2023 UGC regulations?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 2, 3, and 4\n(d) 1 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; the regulations aim to *facilitate* the entry of top-ranked foreign universities, not restrict them. Statement 2 is correct; FHEIs must meet specific global ranking criteria to be eligible. Statement 3 is also correct; the regulations allow for collaborative efforts between multiple FHEIs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UGC initially grants in-principle approval and a Letter of Intent (LoI), with the expectation of campus setup within two years.  Final approval isn't necessarily contingent on an on-site inspection at that stage. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately represent the regulations.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education:\n\n1. RPL is primarily focused on vocational training programs.\n2. RPL aims to integrate informal learning into formal education systems.\n3.  RPL assessments are only conducted by accredited universities.\n4.  RPL certifications are not recognized by all employers.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of RPL in higher education?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile RPL can be applied to vocational training, its scope extends to various forms of learning.  Therefore, statement 1 is not entirely accurate. Statement 2 is correct; RPL's core purpose is to formally recognize prior learning from various sources. Statement 3 is incorrect; RPL assessments can be conducted by different authorized bodies, not solely accredited universities.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; RPL certifications, when properly accredited, are generally recognized by employers.  Therefore, only statements 2 is a fully accurate description of RPL.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding the  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:\n\n1. The report focuses solely on the impact of climate change on food security.\n2. It defines financing for food security and nutrition to include both public and private resources.\n3.  The report indicates that the world is on track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger.\n4. It emphasizes the importance of strengthening the resilience of agrifood systems.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the content of the report?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe report's scope is broader than just climate change's impact on food security. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; the report provides a comprehensive definition of financing for food security encompassing both public and private resources. Statement 3 is incorrect; the report clearly states that the world is far from achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger. Statement 4 is correct; the report highlights the need for resilient agrifood systems.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the report's content.\n\n"

Statement 2 is correct; one RMP's opinion suffices for abortion up to 20 weeks. Statement 3 is correct; abortion beyond 24 weeks is possible in cases of severe foetal abnormalities, subject to the opinion of a medical board. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act does *not* explicitly prohibit abortion in cases of rape.  In fact, court rulings have expanded access to abortion for rape survivors.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate, and statement 1 is partially correct. Option (b) is the correct answer because it acknowledges the partial accuracy of statement 1 and the full accuracy of statements 2 and 3. The other options misrepresent the Act's provisions concerning gestational limits and the circumstances under which abortion is permitted, particularly concerning rape cases.\n"

IIT-B is the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025, at 118th position. IISc, Bangalore is ranked 251-300th in THE World University Rankings 2025.  Therefore, three of the listed institutions are among the top-ranked Indian universities in global rankings. The fourth option refers to a general category of universities ranked 401-500 in QS rankings, not a specific named institution.  This makes (c) the correct answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the criteria is a global top 500 ranking, not top 100. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UGC initially grants in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI), not final approval immediately. Statement 4 is correct; the regulations explicitly permit such mobility and credit transfers.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer.\n\n\n\n5.

Statement 2 is correct; DST is the administrative department. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Prime Minister is the Ex-officio *President*, not Vice-President.  Statement 4 is not explicitly stated,  but the goal is to create a knowledge-driven society, which may indirectly address technological dependence. However, the primary focus is on fostering research and innovation, not solely reducing foreign technology dependence.

Statement 2 is correct; Asmita focuses on providing high-quality study materials in native languages. Statement 3 is correct; it aims to enhance translation using technology. Statement 4 is incorrect; no such project named \"Samarthya\" is mentioned in relation to multilingualism.

Statement 2 is incorrect; they were first released in 2013-14, not 2010-11. Statement 3 is correct; the NHA estimates offer detailed descriptions of financial flows in India's health system. Statement 4 is incorrect; the estimates consider data from various sources, including both public and private healthcare providers. Therefore, three statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):\n\n1. PM-JUGA aims to exclusively focus on improving the health infrastructure in tribal communities.\n2.  The scheme is solely funded through newly allocated central government funds.\n3. The scheme incorporates a focus on sustainable livelihoods for forest right holders.\n4. PM-JUGA was launched after the PM-JANMAN initiative.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are incorrect?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions across various sectors (health, education, livelihood, etc.), not solely health infrastructure. Statement 2 is incorrect; funding comes from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants. Statement 3 is correct; the scheme specifically mentions supporting forest right holders. Statement 4 is correct; PM-JUGA is based on learnings from PM-JANMAN.  Therefore, two statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer.\n\n\n10. Consider the following statements regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):\n\n1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2005.\n2.  The UN-CRPD aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all persons with disabilities.\n3.  India is not a signatory to the UN-CRPD.\n4. The UN-CRPD specifically excludes persons with intellectual impairments.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are incorrect?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; the UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2005. Statement 2 is correct; this is the core objective of the convention. Statement 3 is incorrect; India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD. Statement 4 is incorrect; the convention explicitly includes persons with all types of disabilities, including intellectual impairments. Therefore, three statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer.\n"

The IHR (2005) replaced the International Sanitary Regulations (1951) to provide a more comprehensive and adaptable framework for global health security.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IHR comprises all 194 WHO Member States, *including* Liechtenstein and the Holy See. Statement 3 is correct. The IHR's core purpose is to establish a legally binding international framework that defines countries' responsibilities and rights in addressing cross-border public health crises.  Statement 4 is also correct.  The recent amendments to the IHR specifically address the need for a clearer definition of pandemic emergencies, emphasizing both the geographical spread and the potential strain on national health systems.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct.\n\n\n2. Consider the following about the World Health Assembly (WHA):\n\n1. The WHA is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO).\n2. The WHA's functions include determining WHO policies, appointing the Director-General, and supervising financial policies.\n3. The WHA comprises representatives from all 196 member states of the United Nations.\n4.  The WHA's recent meeting concluded without any significant amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The WHA is the supreme decision-making body of the WHO. Statement 2 is also correct; these are key functions of the WHA. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the WHA includes a vast majority of countries, its membership is tied to WHO membership, not UN membership, and thus the number is different (194 + Liechtenstein and the Holy See). Statement 4 is incorrect; the WHA's recent meeting did result in crucial amendments to the IHR 2005.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):\n\n1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.\n2.  The scheme is named after a tribal leader who resisted the British Raj.\n3. PM-JUGA primarily focuses on infrastructure development in urban areas inhabited by tribal communities.\n4.  Funding for PM-JUGA is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds, separate from existing schemes.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's central objective is to uplift the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Statement 2 is also correct; it's named after Birsa Munda. Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA's focus is on rural tribal communities, not urban areas. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The scheme utilizes funds from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants. Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following features of the National Medical Register (NMR) portal:\n\n1. The NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019.\n2.  The NMR is intended to be a database exclusively for Ayurvedic practitioners in India.\n3. Linking doctors' Aadhaar IDs to the NMR is optional.\n4. The NMR facilitates the interlinking of State Medical Councils (SMCs) for registration verification.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The NMR is a legal requirement under the NMC Act. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NMR covers allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors, not just Ayurvedic practitioners. Statement 3 is incorrect. Linking Aadhaar IDs is a crucial aspect to ensure authenticity and prevent duplication.  Statement 4 is correct; the NMR aims to improve coordination and verification across SMCs.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):\n\n1. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.\n2.  The UN-CRPD aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.\n3.  The UN-CRPD has less than 100 signatory countries.\n4.  India is not a signatory to the UN-CRPD.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct, accurately reflecting the adoption and entry into force dates. Statement 2 is also correct; this is the core objective of the convention. Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD has significantly more than 100 signatories (164 including India). Statement 4 is incorrect; India is a signatory to the convention.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the  'Food Waste Index Report 2024':\n\n1. The FWI tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels globally and nationally.\n2. The FWI supports the goals of SDG 12.3, specifically concerning the reduction of food waste.\n3.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index.\n4. The report found that households worldwide wasted less than half a billion meals daily in 2022.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the FWI's scope includes retail and consumer levels. Statement 2 is also correct; it directly supports SDG 12.3 targets. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian, not the FAO.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The report indicated over *one* billion meals wasted daily, not less than half a billion. Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n7. Consider the following initiatives launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare:\n\n1.  The virtual NQAS Assessment is for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL).\n2.  The Spot Food License Initiative aims to simplify licensing and registration processes through FoSCoS.\n3.  Both initiatives are launched in compliance with the National Health Policy 2017.\n4. The initiatives promote \"Healthcare for All\" by improving health infrastructure and streamlining processes.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the NQAS assessment targets AAMs and IPHLs. Statement 2 is also correct; the Spot Food License Initiative uses FoSCoS for quicker licensing. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The initiatives are compliant with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), not the National Health Policy 2017. Statement 4 is correct; both initiatives contribute to the goal of accessible healthcare.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n8. Consider the following related to the  National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) in India:\n\n1. NADA is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports.\n2. NADA was established as a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860 in 2005.\n3.  NADA's initiatives include the Program for Education and Awareness on Anti-Doping in Sports (PEADS).\n4.  NADA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; NADA's autonomy and ministerial affiliation are accurate. Statement 2 is also correct, specifying its legal establishment and year. Statement 3 is correct; PEADS is a key NADA program. Statement 4 is incorrect. While NADA collaborates internationally, the MoU is with the South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO), not WADA.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the  draft guidelines for the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients (Passive Euthanasia) in India:\n\n1. The guidelines define terminal illness and delineate conditions for withdrawing Life Sustaining Treatments (LST).\n2.  The guidelines mandate compliance with the Supreme Court's directives in the Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. case.\n3.  The guidelines establish a single Primary Medical Board (PMB) for decision-making.\n4.  The guidelines propose the establishment of Clinical Ethics Committees in hospitals for oversight and conflict resolution.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the guidelines provide a definition and criteria for LST withdrawal. Statement 2 is also correct; they are designed to align with Supreme Court precedents. Statement 3 is incorrect. The guidelines propose both a PMB and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB) for a more robust decision-making process. Statement 4 is correct; Clinical Ethics Committees are a key part of the proposed framework. Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n"

The Dhebar Committee's recommendations led to the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory.\n2.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories.\n3.

The Dhebar Committee played a crucial role in identifying and classifying PVTGs, resulting in the recognition of 75 groups across various states and Union Territories. Odisha indeed stands out with the highest number of recognized PVTGs. The criteria mentioned for identifying PVTGs are also accurate, encompassing aspects like livelihood dependence, pre-agricultural practices, and population dynamics.  Finally, the stated aim of the \"Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)\" scheme correctly reflects its objective of balanced socio-economic progress and cultural preservation.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.\n\n\n2. Consider the following about the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA):\n\n1.  The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.\n2.  Habitat rights are granted after consultations with various stakeholders.\n3.  The FRA exclusively grants habitat rights to PVTGs.\n4.  The Dongria Kondhs and Mankidia tribes in Odisha are among those granted habitat rights under the FRA.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe aspects of the FRA.  The Act does define 'habitat' as stated and emphasizes stakeholder consultations before granting rights. Statement 4 is also correct; the mentioned tribes in Odisha have received habitat rights. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While PVTGs are often beneficiaries, the FRA doesn't limit habitat rights *exclusively* to them.  Other traditional forest-dwelling communities are also eligible.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.\n\n\n3. Consider the following features related to Denotified Tribes (DNTs):\n\n1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.\n2.  DNTs were labeled \"born criminals\" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.\n3.  The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1952.\n4.  The Renke Commission recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**  Statement 2 is correct; the British-era Criminal Tribes Act categorized certain communities as inherently criminal. Statement 4 is also correct; the Renke Commission advocated for the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act to prevent the harassment of DNTs.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. While many DNTs are nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are categorized as DNTs.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1949, not 1952. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are entirely accurate.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):\n\n1.  PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda.\n2.  The scheme aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education.\n3.  Funding is solely from newly allocated funds specifically for PM-JUGA.\n4.  PM-JUGA's design incorporates lessons learned from PM-JANMAN.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n(c) 2 and 4 only\n(d) 1, 3, and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect key aspects of PM-JUGA. The scheme's name honors Birsa Munda, its objective is to address infrastructural and social development gaps in tribal communities, and it leverages lessons from PM-JANMAN.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA utilizes existing funds allocated under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST), not solely new, dedicated funds.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about the Global Hunger Index (GHI):\n\n1.  The GHI is released by the World Food Programme.\n2.  The GHI 2024 indicates that the \"Zero Hunger\" goal by 2030 is attainable.\n3.  India's GHI score in 2024 shows an improvement compared to 2023.\n4.  The GHI highlights the link between gender inequality and hunger.\n\nHow many of these statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statements 3 and 4 are entirely correct.  India's GHI score did improve in 2024 compared to 2023.  The GHI report also emphasizes the connection between gender inequality and hunger. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the GHI 2024 suggests the \"Zero Hunger\" goal is unlikely to be met by 2030. Therefore only two statements are accurate.\n\n\n6. Consider the following initiatives aimed at tackling hunger in India:\n\n1.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) provides free food grains.\n2.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance for the second child.\n3.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to bridge nutritional gaps.\n4.  The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(b) 1 and 4 only\n(c) 2 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. PMGKAY does provide free food grains, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on nutritional improvements, and the NFSA legally establishes the right to food. However, statement 2 is incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides support for the *first* child, not the second.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are entirely accurate.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):\n\n1.  The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006.\n2.  India is not a signatory to the UN-CRPD.\n3.  The UN-CRPD aims to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities.\n4.  The Biwako Millennium Framework is related to the UN-CRPD.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**  Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The UN-CRPD indeed aims to protect the rights of persons with disabilities, and the Biwako Millennium Framework supports inclusive societies, aligning with the convention's goals. Statement 1 is incorrect; the UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; India *is* a signatory to the UN-CRPD.  Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements about the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:\n\n1.  The amendments define a pandemic emergency based on wide geographical spread and exceeding national health system capacity.\n2.  The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism primarily for developed countries.\n3.  The amendments aim to improve coordination among countries through National IHR Authorities.\n4.  The 76th World Health Assembly agreed upon these amendments.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 3 only\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 1 and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the amendments to the IHR. The new definition of pandemic emergency considers both geographical spread and the strain on national health systems.  The establishment of National IHR Authorities aims to improve coordination. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the financial mechanism is intended to support *developing* countries. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the amendments were agreed upon at the 77th, not the 76th, World Health Assembly.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.\n\n\n9.  Consider the following regarding the Food Waste Index Report 2024:\n\n1.  The report tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels.\n2.  The UNEP is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI).\n3.  The report supports SDG 12.3, which aims to reduce food waste.\n4.  Households worldwide wasted less than 500 million meals daily in 2022.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The report does track food waste at retail and consumer levels, and it directly supports SDG 12.3's goals.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the UNEP, is the custodian of the FLI. Statement 4 is also incorrect; households wasted *over* 1 billion meals daily, not less than 500 million.  Thus, only three statements are accurate.\n\n\n10. Consider the following about the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:\n\n1.  The report focuses on financing to end hunger.\n2.  The report defines financing for food security to include only public resources.\n3.  The world is on track to achieve SDG 2, \"Zero Hunger.\"\n4.  The report highlights the importance of strengthening agrifood systems.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 4 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the report's content. The report does emphasize financing for food security and nutrition and highlights the need to strengthen agrifood systems for resilience.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; it includes both public and private resources. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report indicates the world is *not* on track to achieve SDG 2. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.\n"

Blood transfusions are explicitly considered a method of doping, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements related to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024:\n\n1. Iceland, Finland, and Norway secured the top three positions.\n2. The report utilizes the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), employing 14 indicators across four dimensions.\n3.  India's ranking improved compared to the 2023 report.\n4. The report indicates that achieving full gender parity will take 134 years at the current rate.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate reflections of the Global Gender Gap Report 2024's findings?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 accurately represent findings from the Global Gender Gap Report 2024.  Iceland, Finland, and Norway consistently rank highly in gender equality, and the report methodology relies on the GGGI with its 14 indicators spread across four key dimensions (economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment). The projection of 134 years to reach full gender parity is also a key finding highlighted in the report.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India's ranking actually declined slightly in the 2024 report compared to its 2023 standing. This decline is significant because it indicates a setback in progress towards gender parity within the country, despite some marginal improvements in certain areas.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the combination of correct and incorrect statements.  Options (a) and (b) underestimate the number of accurate statements, while option (d) overestimates them.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022:\n\n1. The UNDP released the GII 2022 as part of its Human Development Report 2023/2024.\n2.  A GII score of 0 signifies perfect gender equality, while a score of 1 represents maximum inequality.\n3. India\u2019s 2022 ranking improved significantly compared to its 2021 ranking.\n4. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently top the GII rankings globally.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the GII 2022 and its findings?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The UNDP did indeed release the GII 2022 within its Human Development Report 2023/2024. The scoring system of the GII, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality), is correctly described.  Furthermore, Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland frequently appear at the top of global GII rankings, reflecting their high levels of gender equality. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking in the 2022 GII report showed an improvement compared to its 2021 position, but the question implies a significant improvement, which is not supported by the data. The improvement was noteworthy but not dramatic. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the GII 2022.\n\n\n3. Consider the following features of the Food Waste Index Report 2024:\n\n1. It tracks food waste at the production and supply chain levels.\n2. It contributes to the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (a), focusing on reducing food loss.\n3. The UNEP is the custodian of the FWI.\n4.  The report indicates that food waste accounts for a negligible percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhich of the statements above are accurate descriptions of the Food Waste Index Report 2024 and its objectives?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 1 and 3 only\n(c) 2 and 4 only\n(d) 1, 3, and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate representations of the Food Waste Index Report 2024.  The report does indeed track global food waste at retail and consumer levels (although the question incorrectly adds production and supply chain levels), directly contributing to SDG 12.3.1 (a) which focuses on reducing food loss. The UNEP is correctly identified as the custodian agency.  However, statement 4 is false. The report explicitly states that food waste contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, estimating it to be in the range of 8-10%, which is far from negligible. This makes options (b), (c), and (d) incorrect because they either exclude accurate statements or include the inaccurate statement 4.\n\n\n4. Consider the following statements related to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment and Spot Food License initiative:\n\n1. The NQAS assessment is conducted for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) only.\n2. The Spot Food License Initiative streamlines licensing processes through the FoSCoS platform.\n3.  The initiatives are launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\n4.  The NQAS assessment is based on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).\n\n\nHow many of these statements correctly describe the NQAS assessment and Spot Food License initiative?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Spot Food License initiative does utilize the FoSCoS platform to simplify licensing, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the launching agency, and the NQAS assessment is indeed based on the IPHS.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. While AAMs are included, the NQAS assessment also encompasses Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), making the statement incomplete and inaccurate.  Therefore, only three of the statements are entirely correct.\n\n\n5. Consider the following aspects of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, \u2018The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains\u2019:\n\n1.  The report promotes nutrition investments solely in the agricultural sector.\n2.  The report highlights the potential to reduce gender inequalities.\n3. GAIN is an intergovernmental organization.\n4. The report focuses on enhancing business resilience within the agri-food sector.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the content and focus of GAIN's report?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The report does emphasize the potential for nutrition investments to reduce gender inequalities, improve productivity, and strengthen business resilience within the agri-food sector. GAIN is indeed a global alliance, not an intergovernmental organization, but operates with significant input from many governments and organizations, and focuses on the agri-food sector, which includes aspects beyond just agriculture. Statement 1, however, is an oversimplification. While the report heavily focuses on the agri-food sector, it doesn't exclusively limit its scope to agriculture; it considers the entire value chain, including processing, distribution, and retail. This makes option (c) the correct answer.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:\n\n1.  The report's theme centers on financing to end hunger and malnutrition.\n2. The report defines financing for food security as encompassing only public resources.\n3.  The report indicates the world is on track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger.\n4. Five UN specialized agencies jointly released the report.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly characterize the 2024 report on food security and nutrition?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 4 are correct. The report's theme does revolve around financing for food security and nutrition, and it was indeed a joint publication of five UN agencies (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO). However, statement 2 is incorrect; the report explicitly includes both public and private financial resources in its definition of financing for food security. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report clearly states that the world is far from achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).  Therefore, only two statements provide accurate descriptions of the report.\n\n\n7. Consider the following concerning the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC):\n\n1. The GNAFC was established in 2016 at the World Humanitarian Summit.\n2. The GNAFC's primary focus is on addressing the immediate consequences of food crises.\n3.  The European Union, FAO, and WFP are founding partners of the GNAFC.\n4.  The GNAFC produces the annual Global Report on Food Crises.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the GNAFC's mandate, objectives, and activities?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The GNAFC was indeed launched in 2016 at the World Humanitarian Summit, the EU, FAO, and WFP are its founding partners, and it does produce the annual Global Report on Food Crises. However, statement 2 is an oversimplification. While the GNAFC addresses immediate needs, its core focus is on tackling the root causes of food crises to prevent future occurrences, not just managing immediate consequences.  Therefore, only three of the statements provide an accurate picture of the GNAFC.\n\n\n8. Consider the following aspects of the  Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:\n\n1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with limited geographical spread.\n2. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism for developing countries.\n3.  The 77th World Health Assembly agreed upon these amendments.\n4. The amendments aim to improve coordination among countries in handling public health emergencies.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the IHR amendments?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  The amendments do create a financial mechanism to help developing nations, the 77th World Health Assembly approved them, and the overall aim is improved international coordination during health crises. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with *wide* geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, not limited spread.  Therefore, only three statements accurately depict the IHR amendments.\n\n\n9. Consider the following about the Navchetana - National Framework for Early Childhood Stimulation (ECS):\n\n1. Navchetana focuses on children aged 0-6 years.\n2. The framework emphasizes responsive caregiving and early learning opportunities.\n3. Navchetana provides 36 sets of activities categorized by age group.\n4.  The framework is based on the five components of the WHO's nurturing care framework.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe features of the Navchetana ECS framework?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  Navchetana does indeed highlight responsive caregiving and early learning, provides 36 activity sets for different age groups (0-36 months), and is based on the WHO's nurturing care framework (although only two of the five components are specifically emphasized). However, statement 1 is incorrect.  Navchetana's focus is specifically on children from birth to three years (0-3 years), not 0-6 years.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the Navchetana framework.\n\n\n10. Consider the following elements related to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA):\n\n1. WADA's headquarters are located in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n2. WADA was established after the First World Conference on Doping in Sport.\n3. WADA is funded equally by the Olympic Movement and governments worldwide.\n4.  The ADAMS system is a key tool used by WADA to coordinate anti-doping activities.\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately describe aspects of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. WADA's creation followed the First World Conference on Doping in Sport, it receives equal funding from the Olympic Movement and governments, and it utilizes the ADAMS system for coordination. However, statement 1 is incorrect; WADA's headquarters are in Montreal, Canada, not Lausanne, Switzerland.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect facts about WADA.\n"

While the report supports the goals of SDG 12.3, it primarily focuses on SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  The FAO is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Food Loss Index), not the Food Waste Index. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index.

While the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with prohibited substances, it doesn't specifically and solely govern anti-doping regulations in sports.  India has separate anti-doping codes and agencies (like NADA) to handle doping cases within the sporting context.  The Act's scope is broader than just sports-related doping.

The University of Southampton's campus is a significant development under the new UGC regulations.  NIRF 2024 did indeed introduce new ranking categories.  IIT Bombay's ranking in QS World University Rankings is also accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect;  THE World University Rankings 2025 placed IISc Bangalore in a different rank bracket than mentioned (251-300). Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n\n\n5. Consider the following elements of the draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024:\n\n1.  The policy aims to integrate sports with education, aligning with NEP 2020.\n2.  One of its five pillars focuses on leveraging sports for economic development.\n3.  The policy proposes a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system.\n4.  The policy's vision statement emphasizes \"Sports for Nation Building \u2013 Harness the Power of Sports for Nation's Holistic Development.\"\n\n\nHow many of the above elements are correctly identified as part of the draft NSP 2024?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately describe elements of the draft NSP 2024. The policy explicitly aims for integration with NEP 2020, includes a pillar on economic development through sports, proposes a national fitness ranking system, and uses the stated vision statement.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the  National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates:\n\n1. The NHA estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS).\n2. The NHA estimates offer a detailed description of financial flows within India\u2019s health system.\n3. The NHA estimates were first released in 2020-21.\n4. The NHA estimates are prepared according to the System of Health Accounts, 2011.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The NHATS prepares the estimates, they detail financial flows in the health system, and they follow the 2011 System of Health Accounts framework. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NHA estimates have been released since 2013-14, not starting in 2020-21.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding the  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL):\n\n1. RPL is a formal mechanism used to evaluate a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.\n2. The purpose of RPL is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system.\n3. RPL assessments and certifications are conducted by the National Research Foundation (NRF).\n4. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education for the age group 18-23 years increased to 28.4 in 2021-22.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) or related higher education statistics?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  RPL is defined correctly, its purpose is accurately stated, and the GER statistic is correct.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NRF is not involved in RPL assessments and certifications.  Other agencies handle these.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n8. Consider the following concerning the  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:\n\n1. The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting concluded with an agreement on amendments to the IHR, 2005.\n2. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities.\n3. The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to aid developing countries.\n4. The amendments abolish the role of National IHR Authorities.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the key amendments to the IHR, 2005?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the amendments. The WHA meeting did approve amendments; a pandemic is defined as described; and a financial mechanism was established.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the amendments *strengthen* the role of National IHR Authorities, not abolish them.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n"
