Not all nomadic tribes were designated as criminal tribes under the British Raj.  The categorization under the Criminal Tribes Act was arbitrary and based on prejudiced assumptions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act, a discriminatory piece of legislation, was repealed, and the communities previously labeled as \"criminal tribes\" were denotified.  However, the social stigma and marginalization persisted even after the repeal.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The Renke Commission, tasked with studying the issues faced by nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, provided an estimate of their numbers in India. This estimate highlights the significant population size of these marginalized communities and the scale of the challenges they face.  The number provided is an approximation, and the exact figures may vary based on different methodologies and data collection.  The significance lies in recognizing the large number of people impacted by historical injustices and ongoing social and economic marginalization.\n"

The Food Waste Index Report directly supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1(a), which specifically targets the reduction of food losses throughout production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.  This alignment highlights the report's contribution to global sustainability goals.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The report actually found that households across all continents wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, a considerably higher figure than stated.  This emphasizes the vast scale of household food waste and its implications for resource sustainability and environmental impact.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is accurate. The GHI 2024 report clearly indicates that a significant number of countries face extremely high levels of hunger, making the achievement of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030 highly unlikely.  The alarming statistics underscore the global urgency to address food insecurity.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While India's GHI score did improve compared to some previous years, it still falls under the \"serious\" category, not \"low,\" according to the 2024 report.  The report also highlights continued high rates of child wasting and stunting in India.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The GHI report explicitly acknowledges the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change impacts, and heightened hunger. It emphasizes the disproportionate impact on women and girls due to food insecurity and malnutrition, exacerbated by climate-related events.\n"

The FWI Report 2024 explicitly tracks food waste at the retail and consumer (household and food service) levels,  not just at the production stage.  The report's scope includes the entire supply chain from farm to fork.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.

While food waste is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, the percentage is lower than what is stated in the incorrect option.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The UNEP is the custodian agency for the Food Waste Index (FWI), not the Food Loss Index (FLI). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian agency for the FLI. This highlights the distinction between tracking food loss during production and supply chains (FLI) and tracking food waste at the retail and consumer levels (FWI).  These are distinct but related aspects of the wider issue of food sustainability.\n\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a landmark judgment where the Supreme Court of India recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under strict guidelines, linking it to the right to die with dignity and the fundamental right to life (Article 21).  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court did indeed recognize the right to die with dignity in the Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. (2018) case, affirming the legal validity of passive euthanasia.  This right is implicitly linked to Article 21, although not explicitly stated as a separate fundamental right. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Active euthanasia, the deliberate act of ending a life, remains illegal in India.  The legal framework focuses on passive euthanasia, allowing for the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment under very specific, stringent conditions and with judicial oversight.  The focus is on ensuring the patient's dignity and minimizing suffering while respecting the sanctity of life.\n"

RPL is a formal mechanism to assess knowledge and skills acquired through informal learning, but it doesn't include non-formal learning experiences.\n2.  The primary purpose of RPL is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system, granting formal certifications.\n3.  The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in India has seen a significant increase in recent years, fueled in part by RPL initiatives.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

The definition of RPL is crucial here; it aims to acknowledge the diverse pathways to acquiring knowledge and skills, extending beyond solely formal education.  Both informal and non-formal learning are integral parts of the RPL framework.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The core purpose of RPL is to bridge the gap between informal/non-formal learning and formal education, providing a pathway for individuals to gain formal recognition for their existing knowledge and skills.  This integration is crucial for enhancing educational access and opportunities for those who may not have followed traditional educational routes.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the GER in higher education in India has indeed increased, there's no direct evidence to suggest RPL initiatives are the primary drivers of this growth.  Other factors, such as increased access to education, changing societal attitudes towards higher education, and government policies, have also contributed to this rise.  Attributing the increase solely to RPL would be an oversimplification.\n"

While the amendments do establish a States Parties Committee to improve IHR implementation, the statement exaggerates its powers. The committee's role is primarily focused on monitoring and facilitating effective implementation, not imposing sanctions.  Sanctions for non-compliance are usually handled through other WHO mechanisms.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The creation of National IHR Authorities is a key element of the amendments, aiming to improve national-level coordination and communication during public health emergencies.  Direct reporting to the WHO is not explicitly stated in the amendments.\n"

The Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces with 10 or more employees, but these committees lack the power to impose criminal penalties for offenses.\n3.

While the act does not directly address marital rape as a separate criminal offense, the definition of domestic violence is broad enough to encompass such acts.  The lack of a specific criminal clause for marital rape within the PWDVA remains a point of contention.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The PWDVA does mandate ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees, but these committees primarily handle complaints through civil remedies, not criminal prosecution. Criminal charges would be pursued through separate legal channels.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Hiral P Harsora case significantly expanded the scope of the Act by removing the gender-specific limitation on those who can be held responsible for domestic violence, making female relatives also liable.\n"

While the NHA data shows a decrease in OOPE as a percentage of THE, the statement oversimplifies the interpretation.  The actual reduction might not represent a substantial decrease in household healthcare burdens considering factors such as inflation and increased healthcare costs. The statement needs more contextual data to be deemed entirely accurate. Furthermore,  a decrease in OOPE percentage doesn't necessarily equate to a substantial reduction in the absolute amount spent by households.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The NHA data indicates that GHE constituted a larger percentage of THE compared to private sector contributions. This points towards a significant role of government funding in the Indian healthcare system.

The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting reached an agreement on amendments to the IHR, 2005, primarily driven by the need to improve global health security in response to events like the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics.\n2.  The amendments include a definition of a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health systems' response capacity.\n3.  A key amendment establishes a centralized global fund, managed solely by the World Health Organization (WHO), for pandemic preparedness and response, ensuring equitable resource allocation to all member states.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

This clarification is crucial for timely and effective responses.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the amendments do establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of developing countries, it is not a centralized global fund managed solely by the WHO.  The statement oversimplifies the mechanism's structure and governance.  The mechanism involves more complex collaborative efforts and resource allocation strategies.\n"

The GHI 2024 reveals alarmingly high hunger levels in numerous countries, making the Zero Hunger goal by 2030 unattainable at the current rate of progress.  The report indicates a concerning stagnation or even worsening of hunger in several regions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved slightly compared to 2023, moving from 111th to 105th, this does not represent substantial progress.  India still falls under the \"serious\" category, indicating persistent challenges in addressing hunger and malnutrition.  The report highlights continuing high levels of child wasting and stunting.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The GHI 2024 explicitly underscores the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  It points out that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, further exacerbated by the impacts of extreme weather events and climate emergencies.  This intersectional analysis is a key feature of the report.\n"

The NDPS Act is a separate legal instrument dealing with a different, albeit related, area of prohibited substances.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  NADA's anti-doping helpline is not exclusively for elite international athletes.  It aims to provide information and guidance to a broader range of athletes and support personnel, including those at the national and even grassroots levels, to promote awareness and understanding of anti-doping rules.
