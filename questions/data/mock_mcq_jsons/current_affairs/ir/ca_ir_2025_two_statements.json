The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) was indeed signed in 2009 with the primary goal of lowering trade barriers and fostering stronger economic relationships between India and the ASEAN member states.  This involved reducing or eliminating tariffs on a significant number of goods traded between the regions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Contrary to the statement, India experiences a persistent trade deficit with ASEAN. This means that the value of goods imported from ASEAN countries consistently exceeds the value of goods exported from India to ASEAN.  While AITIGA aimed to improve trade balance, it hasn't resulted in a trade surplus for India.  Several factors contribute to this persistent deficit, including the competitiveness of ASEAN manufactured goods and differences in production capabilities.\n"

Two parties agree to exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at a fixed exchange rate on a particular date.  Later, they reverse the transaction, potentially at a different rate, effectively hedging against exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While India does participate in numerous bilateral CSAs (for example, with Japan and the UAE), it is also involved in multilateral CSA arrangements. A notable example is the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement, a multilateral arrangement among the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that includes elements of currency swap facilities.

The CWC does indeed have a strong verification regime, including on-site inspections of declared facilities. However,  the scope of inspections is not limited to military-related facilities.  The CWC also includes provisions for inspections of chemical industries that could potentially be used for the production of chemical weapons, thereby addressing the potential for diversion of materials.

The extension of AFSPA to certain areas of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh is a decision taken by the government based on its assessment of the security situation in those regions.  Such decisions are often made considering factors such as ongoing insurgency, cross-border threats, or internal security concerns.  The government's rationale is usually based on maintaining law and order and protecting national security.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The AFSPA, while granting extensive powers to the armed forces, has been a subject of considerable criticism from human rights organizations.  Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for misuse of these powers, leading to human rights violations.  The Act's provisions related to arrest and detention without due process have been particularly contentious, leading to widespread debate and calls for reform or repeal.  Therefore, characterizing the Act as consistently praised by human rights organizations is fundamentally inaccurate.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is largely correct. Operation Safed Sagar, conducted by the Indian Air Force during Operation Vijay, played a significant role in targeting Pakistani positions in the Kargil conflict.  While it didn't completely neutralize all Pakistani troops, its air strikes disrupted their supply lines and inflicted considerable damage, contributing to India's eventual success.  The operation's impact was substantial, though the claim of complete neutralization might be an overstatement.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Operation Talwar, while aiming to restrict Pakistani naval movements, did not constitute a complete naval blockade.  The Indian Navy's actions focused more on maintaining a strong naval presence and deterring any potential Pakistani naval actions, rather than a full-scale blockade.  A complete blockade would have involved a much more comprehensive and encompassing naval strategy, which was not the case during Operation Talwar.\n"

This ambiguity has led to increased focus on establishing clearer international norms and regulations regarding the use of space for military purposes.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Militarization of space encompasses a broader spectrum than simply the deployment of weapons.  It includes the use of space-based assets, such as satellites and navigation systems, to support military operations on Earth.  This can involve intelligence gathering, surveillance, communication, and navigation, all of which enhance military capabilities without necessarily involving the direct deployment of weapons in space.

India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are key legislative pillars in India's AML/CFT framework.  These acts provide the legal basis for prosecuting money laundering and terrorist financing activities.

The NDB's role is to be a significant player in global development finance.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The NDB's governance structure is designed to provide equal voting rights to all member states.  This contrasts with traditional international financial institutions where voting power is often disproportionately distributed based on financial contributions.  The equal voting rights aim to ensure a more balanced and equitable decision-making process, reflecting the bank's commitment to inclusivity and equitable representation.\n"

The slight discrepancy in the funding target amount doesn't negate the core accuracy of the statement.  The focus on sustainable development is a critical aspect of the initiative, making this a key point for UPSC aspirants to remember.

The UNTOC (Palermo Convention) directly addresses transnational organized crime, including trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, and illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms. However,  many forms of organized crime are intrinsically linked to money laundering.  The Convention's provisions on criminalization and international cooperation indirectly aid in combating money laundering by providing a framework for prosecuting related offenses and facilitating information sharing across borders.  This interconnectedness makes the fight against organized crime and money laundering inherently intertwined.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the success of UNTOC relies heavily on the commitment of individual states,  it's not entirely without mechanisms for addressing non-compliance.  While there isn't a direct international enforcement body,  the convention fosters international cooperation, including mutual legal assistance and extradition, which can indirectly pressure states to adhere to its provisions.  Furthermore,  the international community can exert diplomatic pressure and engage in targeted sanctions against states persistently failing to comply.  The UNTOC's effectiveness is therefore not solely dependent on individual state actions.\n\n"

This demonstrates the strategic importance of diversifying trade routes and reducing reliance on single, potentially vulnerable, pathways.  The Cape of Good Hope route, while longer, offers greater security and flexibility.\n"

The error in the location is a significant geographical inaccuracy that makes the statement incorrect.  Furthermore, it is a stratovolcano, composed of ash, lava, and rock, not primarily granite.\n\nStatement 2 is largely correct.
