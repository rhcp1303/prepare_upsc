Statement 2 is also correct; the Act allows for joint trials in situations where an accused has absconded or hasn't responded to an arrest warrant.  Statement 4 is accurate because it permits oral evidence to be given electronically, including witness statements made before courts. However, Statement 3 is inaccurate. While the Act does address timelines for certain procedures, it doesn't introduce universally stricter timelines across all investigative steps.  The Act focuses on streamlining processes, but the specific timelines aren't uniformly \"stricter\" than before. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:\n\n1.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data processing.\n2.  It mandates consent for personal data processing, with exceptions for government services.\n3.  It grants data principals the right to correct or erase their personal data.\n4. It applies to all personal data processing, regardless of format or location.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe key features of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data. Statement 1 is accurate; the Act establishes the DPBI to monitor compliance and impose penalties. Statement 2 is also correct:  Consent is generally required for data processing, but the Act includes exceptions for legitimate purposes like government services or medical emergencies. Statement 3 accurately reflects the Act's provision granting data principals the right to access, correct, and even erase their personal data under certain conditions.  However, Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act's applicability is limited; it specifically excludes personal data processed for personal purposes and data already publicly available.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the Act's key features.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the President of India's powers related to mercy petitions:\n\n1. The President can commute a death sentence.\n2. The President's power extends to offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.\n3. The President's power applies only to cases tried in the Supreme Court.\n4. The President can pardon a person convicted by a court-martial.\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly reflect the President's constitutional powers concerning mercy petitions as per Article 72?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 4\n(b) 1 and 3 only\n(c) 2 and 4 only\n(d) 3 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 72 of the Indian Constitution grants the President of India the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences. Statement 1 is correct as the President can commute a death sentence to a lesser punishment. Statement 2 is accurate because the President's power extends to offenses against laws falling under the Union's executive power.  Statement 4 is also correct; the President can grant pardons in cases decided by court-martials. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The President's power concerning mercy petitions isn't limited to Supreme Court cases; it extends to sentences passed by various courts, including court-martials.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly reflect the President's constitutional powers.\n\n\n4. Consider the following concerning curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India:\n\n1. A curative petition is the final legal recourse after a review petition is dismissed.\n2. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems from Article 142.\n3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there is evidence of bribery involved in the original trial.\n4.  The Rupa Ashok Hurra case established the framework for curative petitions.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of curative petitions in the Supreme Court?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nCurative petitions represent the last resort for litigants whose review petitions have been rejected by the Supreme Court. Statement 1 is correct; it is the final constitutional remedy. Statement 2 is accurate as the Supreme Court's power to provide complete justice (Article 142) underpins its ability to hear curative petitions. Statement 4 is also correct; the Rupa Ashok Hurra case is the landmark judgment that shaped the process and guidelines for filing curative petitions. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While a curative petition can be filed based on various grounds such as violation of natural justice or apprehension of bias,  the presence of bribery is not the sole or mandatory criterion.  The grounds for a curative petition are broader. Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.\n\n\n5. Consider the following about Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):\n\n1. FTSCs are exclusively funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.\n2.  They primarily handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.\n3.  They are a state-level initiative to expedite justice.\n4. The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, implements the FTSC scheme.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the FTSCs?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at ensuring the speedy disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases. Statement 1 is partially correct; the Nirbhaya Fund bears the expenditure, making it a central component of funding but not the exclusive source.  Statement 2 is accurate; FTSCs focus on cases under the POCSO Act and those involving rape. Statement 4 is also correct; the Department of Justice is responsible for the scheme's implementation. However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  While aiming for swift justice, FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, implemented across states/UTs, not solely a state-level initiative.  Therefore, three statements correctly describe the FTSCs.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):\n\n1. The CBI is a constitutional body.\n2. The CBI Director's selection involves the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India.\n3. The CBI is governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.\n4. The CBI's mandate exclusively focuses on corruption cases.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the CBI?\n\n(a) 2 and 3 only\n(b) 1 and 4 only\n(c) 1, 2, and 3\n(d) 3 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe CBI is India's premier investigating agency. Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body. Statement 2 is correct; the selection process for the CBI Director involves the three mentioned entities. Statement 3 is also accurate; the CBI operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Statement 4 is incorrect; while combating corruption is a key aspect, the CBI's mandate extends to various economic and violent crimes, including cybercrime and high-technology crimes. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.\n\n\n7. Consider the following statements related to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:\n\n1.  The RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.\n2.  The Supreme Court recognized the RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.\n3.  Information related to national security is always exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act.\n4.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the RTI Act's implementation.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the RTI Act, 2005?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe RTI Act, 2005, aims to promote transparency and accountability in governance. Statement 1 is correct; it replaced the earlier Freedom of Information Act. Statement 2 is accurate; the Supreme Court's ruling in the Raj Narayan case established the link between RTI and Article 19. Statement 4 is also correct; the Department of Personnel and Training plays a crucial role in implementing the Act. However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the RTI Act does have exemptions for national security information (under Section 8), it's not an absolute exemption; the specific details and context matter.  The disclosure or non-disclosure depends on a case-by-case assessment of whether releasing the information would jeopardize national security.  Therefore, three statements accurately represent aspects of the RTI Act.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:\n\n1. Aadhaar is an authoritative proof of date of birth.\n2.  Aadhaar numbers are unique and linked to individual biometrics.\n3.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) issues Aadhaar cards.\n4.  Aadhaar cards cannot be deactivated.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe features of the Aadhaar system?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued to residents of India. Statement 1 is incorrect; while Aadhaar can be *used* to establish identity, it is not considered definitive proof of date of birth by the Supreme Court.  Statement 2 is correct; Aadhaar numbers are unique and linked to biometric data to prevent duplication. Statement 3 is also correct; UIDAI is the issuing authority. Statement 4 is incorrect; UIDAI does have the power to deactivate or even cancel Aadhaar numbers under certain circumstances.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Aadhaar system.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the \"right to be forgotten\" (RTBF):\n\n1. The RTBF is an absolute right.\n2. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates the RTBF.\n3. The RTBF originated in French jurisprudence.\n4. The Supreme Court recognized the RTBF as part of the right to life under Article 21.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the \"right to be forgotten\"?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe \"right to be forgotten\" is a complex legal concept. Statement 1 is incorrect; the RTBF is not an absolute right and is subject to limitations based on public interest and other considerations. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does not explicitly mention the \"right to be forgotten\" as a codified right. Statement 3 is correct; the concept has roots in French jurisprudence. Statement 4 is correct; the Supreme Court's Puttaswamy judgment recognized the RTBF as connected to the right to life and privacy under Article 21. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the RTBF.\n\n\n10. Consider the following concerning Inner Line Permits (ILPs):\n\n1.  ILPs are required for all Indian citizens traveling to protected areas.\n2.  The ILP system primarily aims to protect India's international borders.\n3.  NRIs are eligible to apply for ILPs.\n4.  The ILP system originated with the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the ILP system?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nILPs are travel documents allowing access to specified areas in Northeast India. Statement 1 is incorrect; ILPs aren't required for all Indian citizens in protected areas; the requirement varies by location and purpose of visit.  Statement 2 is partially correct; border security is a factor, but the primary aim is also to protect tribal cultures. Statement 3 is incorrect; NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders are generally not eligible for standard ILPs and need different permits. Statement 4 is correct; the ILP system's origins trace back to the 1873 regulations. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the ILP system.\n\n"

This includes sentences awarded by court-martials and death sentences.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has the power to review the manner in which the executive exercises its powers, the President's decision on a mercy petition is generally considered final and not directly subject to judicial review.  The courts might intervene if there is a procedural lapse or violation of fundamental rights, but they cannot directly overturn the presidential pardon.  This is a crucial aspect of the President's discretionary powers in the context of the criminal justice system and reflects the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary.\n"

Valid grounds for a curative petition typically include the violation of principles of natural justice, a judge's failure to disclose a conflict of interest, and a demonstrable apprehension of bias that materially affected the judgment. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Curative petitions are not applicable to every Supreme Court judgment. They are available only in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear case of miscarriage of justice, and the grounds must be very compelling. The Supreme Court has been very restrictive in its approach to curative petitions, emphasizing their extraordinary nature.\n"

The government retains the power to intercept mail for reasons of national security, public order, and similar exigencies.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The 2023 Act, unlike some previous iterations, notably lacks detailed penal provisions for postal offenses.

The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with local self-government, and while cantonments have their own boards, the overarching legal framework is influenced by this amendment. The Ministry of Defence has administrative control over cantonments. Executive orders establish military stations, which are distinct from cantonments that house both military and civilian populations.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are directly involved in cantonment administration. Option 4, while relevant to military areas, is not directly involved in the administration of a cantonment as a whole.\n"

Statement 5 is incorrect; the Act primarily covers public authorities, not private entities. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are accurate.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:\n\n1.  The President's power is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution.\n2.  This power extends to all offenses, irrespective of the convicting court.\n3.  The President can only grant pardons, not commute sentences.\n4.  The power does not extend to cases involving offenses against state laws.\n\nHow many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the President's constitutional powers on mercy petitions?\n\n(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOnly statement 1 is entirely correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases.  Statement 2 is incorrect because Article 72 specifically limits the President's power to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial, for an offense against a Union law, or a death sentence.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the President can commute sentences (reduce the severity of punishment). Statement 4 is incorrect as the President's power extends to offenses against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends, which encompasses a broad range of offenses.  Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding curative petitions in the Supreme Court:\n\n1.  It is the final remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.\n2.  Its basis is derived from Article 142, the court's inherent power to do complete justice.\n3.  It can be filed only if there's a violation of natural justice or judicial misconduct.\n4.  The Rupa Ashok Hurra case established the procedure for filing curative petitions.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe the aspects of curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only (b) 1 and 4 only (c) 2, 3, and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately describe aspects of curative petitions.  A curative petition is indeed the last available legal recourse in the Supreme Court after the dismissal of a review petition (1).  The Supreme Court's power to grant curative relief stems from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice (2). Grounds for filing a curative petition include violations of principles of natural justice, non-disclosure of relevant information by judges, and apprehensions of bias (3). The Rupa Ashok Hurra case is a landmark judgment that established the framework and guidelines for curative petitions in India (4).  Therefore, all the statements correctly represent the characteristics of curative petitions.\n\n\n3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):\n\n1. They are funded entirely by state governments.\n2. Their primary focus is on cases under the POCSO Act.\n3.  They were launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme.\n4. Their efficiency in handling rape cases is a subject of debate.\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly reflects the characteristics of Fast-Track Special Courts in India?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 3 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; FTSCs are funded primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund, a centrally sponsored scheme. While statement 2 is partially true in that they handle POCSO Act cases, it is not their *sole* focus; they also handle rape cases. Statement 3 is correct; the FTSC scheme was launched in 2019. Statement 4 is also largely correct; while designed for efficiency, the effectiveness of FTSCs in swiftly disposing of cases remains a subject of ongoing evaluation and debate.  Therefore, options 3 and 4 are the only accurate statements.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the devolution of taxes between the Union and States:\n\n1.  Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible tax pool.\n2.  The Finance Commission recommends the basis for horizontal devolution.\n3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states based on Article 275.\n4.  States can borrow money from foreign sources without Union consent.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the principles of fiscal federalism in India?\n\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only (b) 1 and 4 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 correctly defines vertical devolution as the share allocated to states from the divisible pool of taxes collected by the Union.  Statement 2 is accurate; the Finance Commission recommends criteria and the percentage share for horizontal devolution among states.  Statement 3 is also correct; Article 275 of the Constitution provides the constitutional basis for grants-in-aid from the Union to states.  Statement 4 is incorrect; states require Union government consent before borrowing from foreign sources. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the mechanisms of tax devolution between the Union and States in India.\n\n\n5. Consider the following about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:\n\n1.  It is granted to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.\n2.  The criteria for SCS are determined by the Prime Minister's Office.\n3.  The 15th Finance Commission was the first to recommend SCS.\n4.  SCS grants states additional financial assistance.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics of Special Category Status (SCS) for states in India?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; SCS is granted to states facing significant developmental challenges. Statement 2 is incorrect; the criteria for SCS are not determined by the PMO but rather through various government processes and commissions, notably Finance Commissions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Fifth Finance Commission, not the 15th, was the first to introduce the concept of SCS. Statement 4 is correct; SCS provides additional central assistance to help bridge the developmental gap.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) accurately reflect the features of SCS.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the suspension of internet services:\n\n1.  Suspension orders must adhere to the principle of proportionality.\n2.  The power to suspend internet services rests solely with the state governments.\n3.  Suspension orders are not subject to judicial review.\n4.  Suspension can be for an indefinite period.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the legal framework surrounding the suspension of internet services in India?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOnly statement 1 is correct; suspension orders must be proportionate to the threat and cannot be excessive. Statement 2 is incorrect; while state governments often issue suspension orders, the central government also has the power to do so.  Statement 3 is incorrect; suspension orders are subject to judicial review. Statement 4 is incorrect;  suspension is temporary and must be justified. Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the legal aspects of internet service suspension.\n\n\n7. Consider the following features of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), 2019:\n\n1.  It broadens the definition of 'consumer' to include online purchases.\n2.  It established the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).\n3.  It abolished the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\n4.  It mandates that all consumer disputes must be resolved through mediation.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe key features of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1, 2, and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the 2019 CPA explicitly includes online transactions within its definition of consumer transactions. Statement 2 is also correct; the CPA, 2019 established the CCPA as a central authority for consumer protection. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CPA, 2019 did not abolish the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission; it reformed and strengthened it. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the CPA encourages mediation, it is not mandatory for all disputes. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the key features of the CPA, 2019.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements about Cantonment Boards in India:\n\n1.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.\n2.  Their administration falls under the purview of the state governments.\n3.  The Station Commander is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.\n4.  They were primarily established after Indian independence.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics of Cantonment Boards?\n\n(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; Cantonment Boards are governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006. Statement 2 is incorrect; their administration is a matter of the Union List, under the central government's purview. Statement 3 is correct; the Station Commander holds the ex-officio presidency of the Cantonment Board. Statement 4 is incorrect; Cantonments were established by the East India Company even before independence.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) are accurate.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change and fundamental rights:\n\n1.  The judgment linked the right to a healthy environment to Article 21.\n2.  The judgment was delivered in the case related to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard.\n3.  The judgment restricted the scope of Articles 14 and 21.\n4.  The judgment mandated the creation of a new fundamental right to a healthy environment.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's ruling on climate change and fundamental rights?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the Supreme Court linked the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to the right to life (Article 21). Statement 2 is also correct; the judgment was made in a writ petition concerning the Great Indian Bustard's protection. Statement 3 is incorrect; the judgment expanded, not restricted, the scope of Articles 14 and 21.  Statement 4 is incorrect; it didn't create a new fundamental right but interpreted existing ones in a broader context.  Thus, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Supreme Court's judgment.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023:\n\n1.  It replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n2.  It restricts the admissibility of electronic evidence.\n3.  It introduced provisions for joint trials.\n4.  It was enacted in response to the 2012 Nirbhaya case.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe the features of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023?\n\n(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the 2023 Act replaces the 1872 Act. Statement 2 is incorrect; it actually *expands* the admissibility of electronic evidence. Statement 3 is correct; it introduced provisions regarding joint trials. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Act modernizes evidence laws, it wasn't directly a response to the Nirbhaya case.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the features of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023.\n\n\n11. Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:\n\n1.  It aims to protect individuals' digital personal data.\n2.  It establishes a Data Protection Board to enforce its provisions.\n3.  It grants unlimited powers to data fiduciaries.\n4.  It was enacted in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the aims and features of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the Act's primary aim is to protect the digital personal data of individuals. Statement 2 is also correct; while the exact structure might vary, the Act establishes a mechanism for enforcement of its provisions through a designated authority. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act aims to balance individual rights with the needs of businesses, not grant unlimited power to data fiduciaries. Statement 4 is incorrect; although the Act addresses concerns about data privacy, its enactment wasn't a direct response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.\n\n\n12. Consider the following regarding the State Election Commission (SEC):\n\n1.  It is constituted under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts.\n2.  It conducts elections for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.\n3.  It is responsible for delimiting constituencies for local body elections.\n4.  Its functions are limited to conducting elections only.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe the role and functions of the State Election Commission?\n\n(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the 73rd and 74th Amendments provided for the constitution of SECs.  Statement 2 is incorrect; SECs are responsible for local body elections, not Lok Sabha or State Assembly elections. Statement 3 is correct; the SECs delimit constituencies for local body elections. Statement 4 is incorrect; SECs have a wider mandate than just conducting elections; they also oversee electoral rolls, handle disputes, and advise the Governor on election-related matters. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.\n\n\n13. Consider the following statements concerning the Delimitation Commission:\n\n1.  Its decisions are final and cannot be challenged in court.\n2.  It is a constitutional body established by the Constitution itself.\n3.  It determines the number of seats and boundaries of constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.\n4.

Statement 1 is incorrect; they are centrally sponsored schemes, with central funding from the Nirbhaya Fund.  Statement 2 is incorrect; their focus is on rape and POCSO cases, not economic offenses.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:\n\n1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.\n2.  They are located at the headquarters of the block panchayat.\n3.  They have both civil and criminal jurisdiction to settle petty disputes.\n4.

Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.  However, the Act exempts certain states and tribal areas.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are located at the headquarters of the *intermediate* Panchayat, not the block panchayat. The level of the panchayat varies depending on the state's panchayat structure.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction to resolve minor disputes at the village level.  Their mobile court nature allows them to reach remote areas.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate based on the principles of natural justice, emphasizing fairness and impartiality.  This allows for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution at the village level.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:\n\n1. It is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.\n2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish contempt from Articles 129 and 215 respectively.\n3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct justice.\n4.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, allows for the imprisonment of individuals for an unlimited duration for contempt.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework for dealing with contempt of court in India.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the inherent power to punish for contempt of court to uphold their authority and ensure the proper administration of justice.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize the court, prejudice judicial proceedings, or obstruct the administration of justice.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, does allow for imprisonment for contempt, it is not for an unlimited duration. There are limitations and provisions for appeals and review, ensuring due process.\n\n\n3. Consider the following features of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India:\n\n1. It was based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.\n2. It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).\n3.  ADCs have a maximum of 30 members, with 26 elected and 4 nominated by the President.\n4. ADCs and ARCs have the power to make laws on subjects including land revenue collection and mineral royalty collection.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was based on the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Nehru Committee.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Governor, as per the Sixth Schedule, has the power to establish ADCs and ARCs in the specified states.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct. ADCs have a maximum of 30 members, with 26 elected and 4 nominated by the *Governor*, not the President.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. ADCs and ARCs possess significant legislative and executive powers, including the authority to make laws on subjects such as forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, social customs, land revenue collection, taxation, trade regulation, and the collection of royalties from mineral extraction.\n\n\n4. Consider the following statements regarding the procedure for the formation of new states in India:\n\n1.  The power to form new states rests solely with the President of India.\n2.  The process is governed by Article 3 of the Constitution.\n3.  A bill for the formation of a new state requires the recommendation of the Prime Minister.\n4.  The Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states or by separating territory from an existing state.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the President plays a crucial role, the power to form new states ultimately rests with the Parliament, not solely the President.  The President's role is primarily in giving his recommendation to the Parliament.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Article 3 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for the formation of new states and the alteration of boundaries of existing states.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A bill for the formation of a new state requires the recommendation of the *President*, not the Prime Minister.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  Parliament has the power to create new states through various methods, including separating territory from existing states, uniting two or more states, or uniting parts of states.\n\n\n5. Consider the following regarding President's power on mercy petitions:\n\n1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offenses against the Union government.\n2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not subject to judicial review.\n3. The President can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.\n4. Mercy petitions can only be filed after all appeals have been exhausted in the court system.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against both Union and State laws, including death sentences.  The jurisdiction is not limited to offenses solely against the Union.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not entirely immune to judicial review. Courts can examine whether due process was followed or if the decision was arbitrary or capricious.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The President can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or any other appropriate sentence. This is a crucial aspect of the President's power to temper justice with mercy.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  Generally, mercy petitions are filed only after all avenues of appeal within the court system have been exhausted.  This ensures that the judicial process is complete before the executive power of clemency is exercised.\n\n\n6. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in India:\n\n1. Curative petitions are available after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed.\n2. They were given shape in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra*.\n3. The power to hear curative petitions is derived from Article 142 of the Constitution.\n4. A curative petition can be filed if the petitioner alleges that the principle of natural justice was not followed.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The landmark case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra* established the concept and procedure for curative petitions in India.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice forms the basis for its jurisdiction to entertain curative petitions.  This power allows the court to rectify any injustice that may have occurred in the lower courts.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. One of the grounds for filing a curative petition is the alleged violation of the principles of natural justice during the earlier proceedings. This ensures that fairness and due process are upheld even at the highest judicial level.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):\n\n1. They are state-sponsored schemes focused on addressing sexual assault cases.\n2. Funding for FTSCs is primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.\n3.  They were launched in 2019.\n4.  Their objective is to expedite the disposal of cases under the POCSO Act.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are *centrally* sponsored schemes, not state-sponsored.  While they primarily address sexual assault and POCSO cases, the sponsorship is at the central level.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Nirbhaya Fund is the primary source of funding for FTSCs, reflecting the government's commitment to speedy justice in such cases.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The FTSC scheme was launched in 2019 and has been extended.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  A major objective is the swift disposal of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, aiming to reduce the backlog and provide timely justice to victims.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements regarding Parliamentary Committees:\n\n1. Parliamentary Committees are extra-constitutional bodies established by the executive branch.\n2.  The Public Accounts Committee was first established in 1950.\n3.  The Estimates Committee examines government expenditure and suggests ways to improve efficiency.\n4.  The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) submits its recommendations to the Prime Minister.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Parliamentary Committees are *not* extra-constitutional; they derive their authority from the Constitution and rules of Parliament. They are integral to the legislative process.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee was first set up in 1921, not 1950.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes government expenditure and makes recommendations for improved efficiency and economy in administration.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The PCOL submits its recommendations to the *President*, not the Prime Minister.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha:\n\n1. It investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges.\n2. It consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.\n3. Parliamentary privileges are special rights and immunities granted to both Houses of Parliament and their members.\n4. The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Committee of Privileges investigates alleged breaches of parliamentary privileges and makes recommendations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges consists of 10 members, not 15, nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.  The Lok Sabha committee has 15 members.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Parliamentary privileges are essential for the smooth functioning of Parliament and protect its members' ability to perform their duties without undue interference.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges is appointed by the *Rajya Sabha Chairman*, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.\n\n\n10. Consider the following statements about Cabinet Committees in India:\n\n1. They are mentioned in the Constitution of India.\n2.  The Political Affairs Committee is chaired by the Home Minister.\n3.  They are primarily used to facilitate decision-making in specific areas.\n4.  Their membership is restricted to Cabinet Ministers only.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Cabinet Committees are *extra-constitutional* bodies; their establishment is based on convention and rules of business, not explicit constitutional provisions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Political Affairs Committee is chaired by the *Prime Minister*, not the Home Minister.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Cabinet Committees are formed to streamline decision-making on complex issues by dividing responsibilities and expertise.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While primarily composed of Cabinet Ministers, Cabinet Committees can include non-Cabinet Ministers as members depending on the subject matter.\n\n\n11. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category States (SCS):\n\n1. The categorization of states as SCS is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.\n2.  SCS states used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.\n3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS status.\n4.  Special packages provided to states are based on objective criteria defined in the Constitution.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not contain a provision for the explicit categorization of states as Special Category States.  The concept evolved through policy decisions and recommendations of Finance Commissions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine the grants given to SCS states.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the *cessation* of the SCS status, leading to a revised funding mechanism.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Special packages are discretionary and not based on strict constitutional criteria.  They are often granted based on need and political considerations.\n\n\n12. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:\n\n1. It grants citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians and who entered India before December 31, 2014.\n2.  It applies to all areas of India, including those under the Inner Line Permit system.\n3.  It reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants to 5 years.\n4. It allows for the cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards based on specified grounds.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The CAA, 2019, provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who meet specific criteria.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The CAA does *not* apply to certain tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura (Sixth Schedule areas) or areas under the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system (Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland).\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The CAA reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants from 11 years to 5 years.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The CAA includes provisions for the cancellation of OCI registration under certain conditions.\n\n\n13. Consider the following about Foreigners Tribunals in India:\n\n1. They are established under the Foreigners Act, 1946.\n2.  They have the sole authority to declare a person a foreigner.\n3.  Their decisions are final and cannot be challenged in any court.\n4. They operate under the same rules of evidence as regular civil courts.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Foreigners Tribunals are established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Only Foreigners Tribunals have the power to declare a person a foreigner in India. This is a crucial aspect of their quasi-judicial role.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Foreigners Tribunal decisions carry significant weight, they are not entirely unchallengeable. They are subject to judicial review in higher courts, particularly the Supreme Court.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Foreigners Tribunals do *not* strictly adhere to the same rules of evidence as regular civil courts. They operate under a more flexible framework, allowing for a wider range of evidence to be considered.\n\n\n14. Consider the following features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:\n\n1. It aims to promote people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans.\n2.  It was launched under the name \"Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas\" in 2018.\n3.  It focuses exclusively on Gram Panchayats.\n4. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is not used in the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) aims to enhance people's participation in the planning process at the panchayat level.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The campaign was launched as \"Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas\" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2018.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan operates across all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).  It is not limited to Gram Panchayats alone.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The PDI is used in the Jan Yojana Abhiyan to identify thematic developmental gaps at the panchayat level, guiding the planning process.\n"

While Aadhaar's architecture allows for nationwide online authentication (Statement 3 is true), the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile/internet connections (Statement 4 is false).  The 2018 Supreme Court judgment clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced for other services.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):\n\n1.  They are funded solely by the central government.\n2.  They are implemented exclusively in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.\n3.  The current framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.\n4.  They were first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fourth Finance Commission.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the features and history of CSS?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. CSS are jointly funded by the central and state governments (Statement 1 is false). They are implemented in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists (Statement 2 is false).  CSS were first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Fourth (Statement 4 is false). Only statement 3 is correct, reflecting the current framework's basis.\n\n\n3. Consider the following statements concerning Special Category States (SCS):\n\n1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.\n2.  Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted SCS status based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.\n3.  SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.\n4.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, SCS ceased to exist.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflects the historical context and constitutional basis of SCS in India?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 3 and 4 only\n(d) 1 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain a provision for categorizing states as SCS (Statement 1 is false). While Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted special status, this was based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Fourth (Statement 2 is false). Statement 3 is correct:  SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Statement 4 is also correct: The 14th Finance Commission recommended the cessation of SCS, and consequently, no new SCS have been granted since.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:\n\n1. It was a result of the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.\n2.  It applies to all states in the North-Eastern region.\n3. It deals primarily with the administration of tribal areas.\n4. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe features of the Sixth Schedule?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2, 3, and 4\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 3 and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee (Statement 1 is false).  It doesn't apply to all North-Eastern states; its application is specific to certain areas within those states (Statement 2 is false). Statements 3 and 4 are correct: The Sixth Schedule primarily concerns the administration of tribal areas and provides for the creation of autonomous district councils within those areas.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about Parliamentary Committees:\n\n1.  They are appointed solely by the Lok Sabha Speaker.\n2.  Their authority stems directly from Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution.\n3.  The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of only state governments.\n4.  The Estimates Committee was first constituted in 1921.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the functioning and powers of Parliamentary Committees in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements are incorrect. Parliamentary Committees are appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker (Statement 1 is false).  Their authority derives from Articles 105 and 118, but also from established parliamentary conventions (Statement 2 is partially correct, but needs more detail). The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India, not just state governments (Statement 3 is false). The Estimates Committee was first constituted in 1950, not 1921 (Statement 4 is false).\n\n\n6. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:\n\n1. It aims to reduce people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.\n2. It was launched under the name \"Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas\" in 2018.\n3.  It involves only elected representatives in the planning process.\n4.  It uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the objectives and implementation of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to *accelerate* people's participation (Statement 1 is false). It involves various stakeholders including elected representatives, government workers, CBOs, and SHGs (Statement 3 is false). While the PDI is used, the statement implies exclusive reliance on it, which isn't entirely true (Statement 4 is false). Only statement 2 correctly identifies the program's launch name and year.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:\n\n1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against Union laws.\n2.  The President's power extends to death sentences imposed by civil courts but not court martials.\n3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.\n4. The President can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are incorrect. Article 72 extends to pardons for offenses against both Union and State laws, as well as court-martial sentences (Statement 1 is false). The President's power explicitly includes death sentences from both civil courts and court martials (Statement 2 is false).  Statement 3 is partially true; while the Supreme Court can interpret Article 72's scope, direct judicial review is limited. Statement 4 is correct, as the President can commute sentences, including death sentences.\n\n\n8. Consider the following about Curative Petitions:\n\n1.  They are available after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.\n2.  Their basis lies in Article 142 of the Constitution.\n3.  They can be filed only when there's a clear violation of substantive law.\n4. They are the first constitutional remedy available.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the nature and availability of Curative Petitions in India's legal system?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Curative petitions are available after the dismissal of a review petition, not a writ petition (Statement 1 is false). While Article 142 provides the basis for the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, the grounds for a curative petition are more specific (Statement 3 is false).  A curative petition is the *last*, not first, resort (Statement 4 is false). Only Statement 2 is correct, highlighting the constitutional basis of curative petitions.\n\n\n9. Consider the following features of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:\n\n1.  The Act was enacted in October 2005.\n2.  It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.\n3.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the Act's implementation.\n4.  The Act mandates disclosure of all information held by public authorities.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the RTI Act?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOnly statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act was enacted in June 2005 and came into force in October 2005 (Statement 1 is false).  The other statements accurately reflect aspects of the RTI Act: It replaced the 2002 Act (Statement 2 is true), the Department of Personnel and Training coordinates its implementation (Statement 3 is true), and the Act does not mandate disclosure of *all* information, as certain exemptions exist (Statement 4 is true).\n\n\n10. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:\n\n1.  Cantonments are exclusively for military personnel.\n2.  The first cantonment was established after Indian independence.\n3.  Cantonment Boards are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.\n4.  Their local self-government is a subject matter of the State List in the Constitution.\n\nHow many of the above statements are INCORRECT about the nature and administration of Cantonment Boards?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. Cantonments house both military and civilian populations (Statement 1 is false).  The first cantonment was established by the East India Company well before independence (Statement 2 is false). The local self-government of cantonments falls under the Union List, not the State List (Statement 4 is false). Only Statement 3 is correct, reflecting the Ministry of Defence's administrative oversight.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:\n\n1. It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).\n2. It was launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Rural Development.\n3.  The campaign involves structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas at the village level.\n4. The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The primary aim of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is to enhance people's participation in the creation of PDPs, ensuring plans reflect local needs and priorities.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the campaign's essence aligns with the inclusive development philosophy,  it was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan utilizes structured meetings at various levels (Ward, Mahila, Gram Sabhas) to facilitate participatory planning.  This bottom-up approach ensures local voices are heard.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  Transparency and accountability are key aspects. The publication of approved GPDPs on the e-Gram Swaraj portal ensures public access and scrutiny.\n\n\nTherefore, three of the four statements accurately reflect the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's characteristics and objectives.  The incorrect statement relates to the launching ministry.\n\n\n\n2. Consider the following features of Gram Nyayalayas:\n\n1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, excluding Nagaland and certain tribal areas.\n2.  They function as courts of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, appointed by the state government in consultation with the High Court.\n3. They primarily handle civil disputes, with limited jurisdiction over criminal matters.\n4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence stipulated in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the key features of Gram Nyayalayas?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes these courts, with specific exclusions mentioned in the Act itself.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed courts of Judicial Magistrate First Class, with the appointment process involving both state and High Court authorities.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction, designed to resolve petty disputes at the village level.  Their jurisdiction is not limited to only civil disputes.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  While they aim for conciliation, Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, instead operating under principles of natural justice.\n\n\nTherefore, only two of the four statements accurately reflect the key features of Gram Nyayalayas.  The inaccuracies lie in the description of their jurisdiction and the application of evidence rules.\n\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:\n\n1. It is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.\n2.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish for contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.\n3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct justice.\n4. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, does not differentiate between civil and criminal contempt.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly describes aspects of Contempt of Court in India?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2 and 4\n(c) 1 and 3\n(d) 3 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the primary legislation defining and outlining procedures for dealing with contempt of court.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the inherent power to punish for contempt to uphold their authority and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is well-established. Civil contempt involves disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct justice.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, clearly distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt, outlining different procedures and penalties for each.\n\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of contempt of court in India.  Statement 4 presents a misconception about the Act's provisions.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016:\n\n1.  Aadhaar primarily serves as proof of Indian citizenship.\n2.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its 2018 judgment.\n3. The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.\n4.  The Supreme Court mandated Aadhaar for opening bank accounts and mobile connections.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's ruling on the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and the nature of Aadhaar?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court, in its 2018 judgment, upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, while also imposing certain limitations on its application and data handling.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's ruling stipulated that Aadhaar metadata should not be stored for more than six months to protect privacy.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be *mandatory* for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  While it can be used for accessing certain government welfare schemes, it cannot be imposed universally for all private services.\n\nTherefore, only one statement (3) accurately reflects the Supreme Court's judgment and the nature of Aadhaar.  The other statements contain significant inaccuracies.\n\n\n\n5. Consider the following about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):\n\n1. CSSs are funded solely by the central government.\n2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers.\n3.  CSSs are implemented exclusively in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.\n4.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of CSSs.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the nature and funding of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, sharing the financial burden of implementation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The current structure of CSSs is largely influenced by the recommendations of the 2015 report by the sub-group of Chief Ministers on rationalization of CSSs.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. CSSs cover sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.  They are not limited to the Union List.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended a shift away from the traditional CSS model, leading to their discontinuation as a distinct category of schemes.  The funding mechanisms for similar programs have evolved since then.\n\nTherefore, only two statements (2 and 4) correctly describe aspects of CSSs.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding funding and the constitutional lists involved.\n\n\n6. Consider the following features of the Lokpal:\n\n1.  The Lokpal's inquiry wing is headed by a Director of Investigation, assisted by three Superintendents of Police.\n2. The Lokpal has the power to supersede the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in any investigation.\n3. The Lokpal's prosecution wing handles cases related to offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n4. The Lokpal serves as the final appellate authority for all public grievances.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the structure and powers of the Lokpal?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Lokpal's inquiry wing has a hierarchical structure, with the Director of Inquiry at the top, supported by Superintendents of Police and other staff.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but needs clarification. The Lokpal has the power to *superintend and direct* central investigation agencies, including the CBI, for cases referred to it, not to supersede them entirely.  The CBI retains its independence but operates under the Lokpal's direction for specific cases.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Lokpal's prosecution wing is responsible for prosecuting public servants for offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, based on the inquiry wing's findings.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The Lokpal's appellate authority is limited to cases involving corruption findings under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. It is not the final appellate authority for *all* public grievances.\n\n\nTherefore, three statements (1, 2 with clarification, and 3) largely reflect the Lokpal's structure and powers. Statement 4 overstates the scope of its appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n7. Consider the following statements related to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):\n\n1.  iCAL was inaugurated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n2.  iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.\n3.  iCAL primarily focuses on capacity building for auditors in the private sector.\n4.  iCAL functions as a knowledge center for addressing governance issues at the local level.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe iCAL and its functions?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  A key objective of iCAL is to set global benchmarks for auditing local governance, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of audits at the local level.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While iCAL contributes to capacity building, its focus is on auditors working within local governance bodies, not primarily the private sector.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  iCAL acts as a repository of knowledge and a think tank, addressing challenges and improving governance at the grassroot level.\n\n\nTherefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately depict iCAL's location, aims, and functions.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding the auditing mechanism of local bodies in India:\n\n1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) does not have a mandate to audit local bodies.\n2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.\n3. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) audits are conducted under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.\n4. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 provide provisions for local self-governance, including auditing mechanisms.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the auditing of local bodies in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The CAG does have a mandate to audit local bodies, derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.  This is a crucial aspect of financial accountability at the local level.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a significant technological advancement, streamlining the auditing process and promoting transparency.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While ELFA/DLFA conduct audits, they operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts laid the foundation for local self-governance, which includes provisions for financial accountability and auditing mechanisms.\n\n\nTherefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the auditing mechanisms for local bodies in India.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding the CAG's role and the supervisory authority for ELFA/DLFA.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:\n\n1. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.\n2. It grants special autonomy to tribal areas within Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.\n3. It mandates the establishment of District Councils to administer these areas.\n4. It provides for the establishment of a separate judiciary for the Sixth Schedule areas.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the provisions of the Sixth Schedule?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee's report played a crucial role in shaping the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule grants special autonomy to certain tribal areas within the four states mentioned (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram).  This autonomy is designed to protect the unique cultural and administrative needs of these areas.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  District Councils are established under the Sixth Schedule to administer the designated areas, giving them significant control over local governance.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  While the Sixth Schedule provides for special administrative arrangements, it does not mandate a separate judiciary for the areas covered.  The existing judicial system continues to operate, but the District Councils have some administrative and legislative powers.\n\n\nTherefore, only two statements (2 and 3) accurately describe the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.  Statements 1 and 4 contain inaccuracies regarding the originating committee and the judicial structure.\n\n\n10. Consider the following statements related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, and its related rules:\n\n1. The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.\n2.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were introduced to repeal the CAA, 2019.\n3.  The CAA, 2019, automatically grants citizenship to all individuals who meet its eligibility criteria.\n4. The CAA, 2019, does not apply to the state of Assam.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the CAA, 2019, and its associated rules?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for religious minorities (excluding Muslims) from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who had fled persecution.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were introduced to *enforce* the CAA, 2019, not to repeal it.  The rules provided the framework for implementing the Act's provisions.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, does not automatically grant citizenship.  Individuals must apply and meet specific eligibility criteria, including proof of persecution and residence in India for a certain period.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While the CAA, 2019, has faced challenges and legal debates, especially concerning its application in Assam, it does not explicitly exclude the state from its scope.  The application and implementation of the CAA in Assam have been a subject of considerable discussion and legal challenges.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement (1) accurately describes the CAA, 2019, and its associated rules.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or misconceptions about its implementation and legal implications.\n"

The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used to determine grants for SCS states.\n3.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS ceased to exist.\n4.  The current special funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain any provision for categorizing states as Special Category States (SCS).  The SCS was a classification used by the Central government to provide special financial assistance and other benefits to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. This was based on recommendations from Finance Commissions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Historically, SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, a method of distributing central funds.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS classification, leading to its abolishment.  This was a significant shift in central-state financial relations.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The current financial assistance to Northeastern and Himalayan states is not based on SCS status but on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, reflecting a change in the approach to providing special assistance.\n\n\n2. Consider the following features of Special Packages provided to Indian states:\n\n1.  They are exclusively allocated based on demonstrable need.\n2.  They are governed by specific constitutional provisions outlining eligibility criteria.\n3.  They are an additional grant under Article 282.\n4.  They are subject to strict parliamentary oversight and approval procedures.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe Special Packages?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n(b) 3 only\n(c) 2 and 4\n(d) 1, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While need may be a factor considered, special packages are primarily discretionary, not solely determined by objective need assessment.  The decision to provide a special package involves political and strategic considerations beyond just quantifiable needs.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Special packages are not governed by specific constitutional provisions outlining eligibility criteria.  The provision of special packages is not a codified process with clear, pre-defined rules.  They are essentially ad hoc measures at the discretion of the central government.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Special packages are provided as additional grants under Article 282 of the Constitution, which allows for discretionary grants for any public purpose.  This article provides the legal basis for these ad hoc financial allocations.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The process for granting special packages isn't subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny and formal approval procedures as other budgetary allocations. While they might be discussed, they don't undergo the same rigorous legislative process.\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:\n\n1.  It was established based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.\n2.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).\n3.  ADCs have a maximum of 20 elected members.\n4.  ADCs and ARCs have authority over subjects like land revenue collection and mineral royalty regulation.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was a result of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee was specifically tasked with addressing the governance challenges in the Northeastern states.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Article 244(2) of the Constitution, under which the Sixth Schedule operates, empowers the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs in specified tribal areas. This is a key feature of the Schedule's design.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. ADCs consist of not more than 30 members, with a specific allocation for nominated and elected representatives.  The actual number of elected members can vary.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. ADCs and ARCs have significant powers, including authority over land revenue, taxation, trade regulation, and the collection of royalties from mineral extraction. This reflects their role in managing resources within their areas.\n\n\n4. Consider the following aspects of Fiscal Federalism in India:\n\n1.  The Seventh Schedule outlines the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.\n2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among different states.\n3.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution.\n4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Fiscal Federalism in India?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 3 only\n(c) 2 and 4\n(d) 1 and 3\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution delineates the tax bases between the Union and States (Article 246), but the actual distribution of revenue is determined by the Finance Commission and not directly defined in the Seventh Schedule.  The Finance Commission's recommendations guide the distribution, but the Schedule sets the broad framework.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes allocated to states from the central government. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, deals with the distribution of this share among the different states.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance. This is a key mechanism for transferring resources to states.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While the Union government can borrow money both within and outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only within India (Article 293). This is a crucial difference in their borrowing powers.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):\n\n1.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).\n2.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes outside the National Development Agenda.\n3.  Funding for CSSs is directly transferred to the states, bypassing the Consolidated Fund of the State.\n4.  The funding pattern for core schemes varies between 90:10 and 60:40 for different states.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)?\n\n(a) 1 and 4\n(b) 2 and 3\n(c) 1 only\n(d) 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The current framework of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) is indeed based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, which was submitted in 2015. This report significantly shaped the design and implementation of CSSs.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are designed to align with the National Development Agenda and contribute to achieving national goals.  They are not focused on schemes outside the national development priorities.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  All transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State, ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of funds.  This is a crucial element of fiscal management.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The funding pattern for core schemes under CSSs varies, with a 90:10 Centre:State ratio for eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states, and a 60:40 ratio for other states.  This reflects the varying needs and developmental priorities of different regions.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:\n\n1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.\n2.  Parts of Rajasthan are included in Restricted Areas.\n3.  Sikkim is entirely a Restricted Area.\n4.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas, except citizens of Bhutan.\n\nHow many of the statements above are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The entire state of Arunachal Pradesh falls under the designation of Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Parts of Rajasthan are designated as Protected Areas, requiring foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) to obtain permits for entry.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, defines these areas.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Sikkim is partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area, not entirely a Restricted Area.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, delineates these distinct zones within the state.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, mandates that foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) need special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas.  This is a key aspect of access control in these sensitive regions.\n\n\n7. Consider the following regarding the formation of new states in India:\n\n1.  The process is solely governed by the provisions of Article 3 of the Constitution.\n2.  The President's recommendation is required for introducing a bill related to state formation in Parliament.\n3.  The process involves the mandatory consultation with state legislatures of affected states.\n4.  The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in determining the boundaries of new states.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe the formation of new states in India?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n(b) 2 only\n(c) 2 and 3\n(d) 1, 2, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While Article 3 of the Constitution is the primary legal basis, the process also involves other considerations and practices, including political negotiations and consultations.  It is not solely governed by Article 3.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill related to the formation of new states can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's recommendation.  This is a crucial constitutional safeguard.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While consultations may occur, they are not mandatory.  The process of state formation is primarily at the discretion of the Parliament and the President.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court does not have a direct role in determining boundaries.  The Parliament has the ultimate authority in this matter, though boundary disputes might end up in Court.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:\n\n1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2018.\n2.  They are located at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat.\n3.  They function as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class.\n4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence provided in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not 2018.  The year is a crucial detail in understanding the legal framework.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are typically situated at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat, enabling easier access for villagers.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  They are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, giving them legal standing and jurisdiction.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate on the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:\n\n1.  It is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1981.\n2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders.\n3.  Criminal contempt includes acts that scandalize the authority of a court.\n4.  The power to punish contempt rests solely with the Supreme Court.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Contempt of Court is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not 1981. The year is a crucial detail for legal precision.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Civil contempt refers to willful disobedience of court orders, judgments, or decrees.  This is a core element of civil contempt.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of courts, or interfere with the administration of justice. This protects the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court (Article 129) has the power to punish contempt, so do High Courts (Article 215).  Both levels of judiciary have this inherent power to maintain their authority.\n\n\n10. Consider the following about Cantonment Boards in India:\n\n1.  They were initially established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Panipat.\n2.  Their administration falls under the purview of the Union Government.\n3.  Cantonment Boards are headed by an elected President chosen by the civilian population.\n4.  They are primarily responsible for providing civic amenities within cantonment areas.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments were established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey (1757), not Panipat.  The battle is a significant historical detail in understanding their origin.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the Union List (Entry 3), placing them under the Union Government's purview.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Cantonment Board's President is the Station Commander (ex-officio), not an elected civilian.  This reflects the military's significant role in cantonment administration.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  Cantonment Boards are responsible for providing civic amenities such as public health, water supply, and primary education within cantonment areas.  This is their primary function.\n\n\n11. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:\n\n1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offences against Union laws.\n2.  The President can commute a death sentence.\n3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review.\n4.  The President's power extends to cases involving court-martial sentences.\n\n\nHow many of the statements above are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense. This includes offenses against both Union and State laws, as well as court-martial sentences.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The President's power under Article 72 explicitly includes the authority to commute a death sentence, reducing it to a lesser punishment.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While there have been judicial pronouncements on the process surrounding mercy petitions, the President's decision itself is not directly subject to judicial review.  This reflects the executive nature of the power.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Article 72 explicitly covers cases involving sentences by a court-martial, extending the President's pardoning power to military justice.\n\n\n12. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court:\n\n1.  They are the last constitutional remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.\n2.  They were established through the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.\n3.  They are based on the Supreme Court's power under Article 141.\n4.  They require demonstrating a violation of principles of natural justice.\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe Curative Petitions?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 4\n(b) 2 and 3\n(c) 1 and 4\n(d) 3 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Curative petitions provide a final avenue for redressal after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court, representing the last resort within the constitutional framework.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The concept and procedure for curative petitions were established in the landmark case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.  This case shaped the legal understanding of curative petitions.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions flows from Article 142, which grants the court the power to do complete justice, not Article 141.  Article 141 deals with the binding nature of Supreme Court decisions.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  One of the grounds for filing a curative petition is to demonstrate a clear violation of the principles of natural justice during the proceedings that led to the original judgment.\n\n\n13. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):\n\n1.  They were launched as a state-sponsored scheme in 2019.\n2.  Their funding is primarily sourced from the Nirbhaya Fund.\n3.  They are implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n4.  Their primary objective is the swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs were launched as a *centrally* sponsored scheme in 2019, not a state-sponsored one.  The funding source and implementation indicate the central government's role.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Nirbhaya Fund is the primary source of funding for FTSCs, highlighting the government's commitment to addressing crimes against women and children.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. FTSCs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the judicial focus of the initiative.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the speedy disposal of cases related to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  This is a crucial aspect of their mandate.\n\n\n14. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:\n\n1.  It is implemented at only the Gram Panchayat level.\n2.  It focuses on preparing Panchayat Development Plans for the next fiscal year.\n3.  It emphasizes the participation of elected representatives and community-based organizations.\n4.  It uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is implemented at all three tiers of Panchayats \u2013 Gram, Block, and District \u2013 ensuring a holistic approach to planning.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A key objective of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the upcoming fiscal year, fostering proactive planning.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Abhiyan actively involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, and community-based organizations like SHGs, ensuring broad-based participation.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The PDI is used to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Sabha level, providing a data-driven approach to planning.\n\n\n15. Consider the following regarding Common Service Centres (CSCs):\n\n1.  They are a key component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).\n2.  They are primarily focused on providing services to urban populations.\n3.  They offer services exclusively from the government sector.\n4.  They are administered by the Ministry of Rural Development.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. CSCs are one of the three pillars of the NeGP, playing a vital role in extending e-governance to rural areas.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. CSCs are primarily designed to provide services to rural citizens, bridging the digital divide and improving access to information and services.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. CSCs provide a range of services from government, private, and social sector entities, offering an integrated platform for various needs.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. CSCs are overseen by the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The Ministry of Electronics & IT is responsible for the overall implementation of the CSC scheme.\n\n\n1. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India:\n\n1.  Funding routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.\n2.  Based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.\n3.  Constitute around 10.4% of the Centre's budget expenditure.\n4.  Primary mode of specific purpose transfers from the Union to States post-2017.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics of CSSs?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India.  The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  Funding for CSSs is channeled through the Consolidated Fund of the State.  They represent a significant portion of the central government's budget, approximately 10.4%. Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017, CSSs became the primary mechanism for specific purpose transfers from the Union to States.  Therefore, all four statements are correct, making option (d) the appropriate choice.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the accuracy of the provided information regarding CSS characteristics.\n\n\n2. Consider the following aspects of Mission Karmayogi:\n\n1.  Launched as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB).\n2.  Aims to create a future-looking civil service imbued with India's developmental aspirations.\n3.  Includes all civil servants, irrespective of employment type, across various government entities.\n4.  Focuses solely on rule-based training and capacity building.\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly represent the objectives and scope of Mission Karmayogi?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 1 and 4 only\n(d) 3 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Mission Karmayogi, under the NPCSCB, aims to modernize the Indian civil service.  It encompasses all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments. The program prioritizes aligning the civil service with India's developmental goals and national priorities.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Mission Karmayogi explicitly shifts from rule-based to role-based training and a competency-driven approach. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they either include the false statement 4 or omit crucial aspects of the initiative.\n\n\n3. Consider the following elements related to India's fiscal federalism:\n\n1.  Horizontal devolution is based solely on population data.\n2.  Vertical devolution currently stands at 41%, as per the 15th Finance Commission.\n3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states under Article 275.\n4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.\n\nHow many of the above statements regarding India's fiscal federalism are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Vertical devolution, as per the 15th Finance Commission, allocates 41% of the divisible pool to states. Grants-in-aid are constitutionally mandated under Article 275. Statement 1 is incorrect; horizontal devolution considers multiple factors beyond just population, including income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts. Statement 4 is incorrect; state governments can borrow only within India, not internationally, as per Article 293.  Therefore, only two statements are correct, making (b) the correct option.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the Special Category Status (SCS) in India:\n\n1.  The constitution explicitly defines provisions for SCS.\n2.  SCS grants were based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.\n3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.\n4.  States like Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded SCS.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements concerning the Special Category Status are accurate?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. SCS grants were historically calculated using the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  Recently, states like Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have advocated for SCS.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the constitution lacks explicit provisions for SCS.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:\n\n1.  It resulted from recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.\n2.  It allows the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) only.\n3.  ADCs have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management and agriculture.\n4.  The Sixth Schedule applies to all states in India.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?\n\n(a) 1 and 3 only\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 1, 2, and 3\n(d) 1, 3, and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), stems from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. ADCs established under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers over areas such as forest management and agriculture. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Governor can establish both ADCs and ARCs (Autonomous Regional Councils). Statement 4 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule's applicability is limited to specific states, namely Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 accurately represent aspects of the Sixth Schedule.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the process of forming new states in India:\n\n1.  The President's recommendation is not required for introducing a bill related to state formation.\n2.  Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states.\n3.  Article 3 solely deals with the formation of new states.\n4.  The process involves only the Parliament and excludes any role of state legislatures.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate representations of the process for forming new states in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:** Only statement 2 is correct. Parliament has the power to create new states by combining parts of existing ones, as per Article 3.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the President's recommendation is mandatory for introducing such a bill. Statement 3 is incorrect; Article 3 also covers altering areas, boundaries, or names of existing states. Statement 4 is incorrect; while Parliament holds the primary power, state legislatures may be involved in the process, particularly concerning the affected states' perspectives.  Therefore, only one statement (2) accurately describes the process of forming new states.\n\n\n7. Consider the following concerning the auditing of local bodies in India:\n\n1.  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies originates from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.\n2.  The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is used exclusively for auditing urban local bodies.\n3.  The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) functions independently of the CAG.\n4.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance.\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately reflect the auditing mechanisms of local bodies in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2 and 4 are correct. The CAG's authority over auditing local bodies is established by the 1971 Act.  AuditOnline facilitates online audits of panchayat accounts.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance. Statement 3 is incorrect; ELFA/DLFA operate under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision. Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct, making (c) the correct option.\n\n\n8. Consider the following features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:\n\n1.  It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).\n2.  It is implemented only at the Gram Panchayat level.\n3.  It involves only elected representatives in the planning process.\n4.  It utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People\u2019s Plan Campaign)?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3 and 4 are correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on enhancing public participation in PDP preparation. It involves elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations.  The PDI is utilized to identify thematic gaps.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Abhiyan operates at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).  Therefore, three of the four statements accurately reflect the features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.\n\n\n9. Consider the following about the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):\n\n1.  The DPBI\u2019s decisions are directly appealable to the Supreme Court of India.\n2.  Data fiduciaries must inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a data breach.\n3.

Statement 4 is also incorrect; CSCs offer a range of services, including G2C, business-to-consumer (B2C), and financial services.\n"

        "question_text": "Consider the following about the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**\n\n1.  It aims solely to protect the data of Indian citizens.\n2.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data protection.\n3.  The Act gives data principals the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.\n4.  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Supreme Court of India.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023?\n",

        "option_b": "Only two\n",
        "option_c": "Only three\n",
        "option_d": "All four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act does establish the DPBI to regulate data protection. It grants data principals rights including the right to correction and erasure.  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Act primarily focuses on data within India, its reach extends to data processing involving Indian citizens even if it occurs outside India.  The Act does not only protect the data of Indian citizens.  It also considers cases of cross-border data transfer and processing.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:\n\n1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against any law relating to a matter within the executive power of the Union.\n2.  The President's power extends to death sentences imposed by court-martials.\n3.  The President's mercy power is absolute and not subject to judicial review.\n4.  The President can only consider mercy petitions after all appeals have been exhausted.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes death sentences.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the President's power is significant, it is not absolute.  The Supreme Court has held that the President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review on limited grounds, such as if the process was vitiated by procedural impropriety or if the decision was arbitrary or capricious.\n\nStatement 4 is also incorrect.  While typically mercy petitions are filed after all appeals have been exhausted, there is no strict constitutional mandate requiring this.  The President has the discretion to consider a petition at any stage.\n\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding a curative petition in the Supreme Court of India:\n\n1.  It is the final remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.\n2.  It is based solely on the principle of judicial precedent, ensuring consistency in judgments.\n3.  It can be filed only if a violation of the principles of natural justice is demonstrably proven.\n4.  The power to grant a curative petition stems from the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics and procedures related to curative petitions?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While consistency in judgments is a desirable goal, curative petitions are not solely based on this principle. They are granted in exceptional cases where there has been a miscarriage of justice, potentially due to a violation of natural justice, non-disclosure of material facts by the judge, or other significant errors.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct.  A violation of principles of natural justice is a *ground* for filing a curative petition, but it's not the only one.  Other grounds include demonstrable errors in the judgment or the presence of significant new evidence.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142, which allows it to do complete justice, is the source of its authority to entertain curative petitions.  This power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n\n3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):\n\n1.  They are exclusively funded by state governments.\n2.  Their primary focus is on cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.\n3.  They are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.\n4.  They aim to expedite the disposal of cases related to rape and the POCSO Act.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately describe the FTSCs?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2 and 4\n(c) 3 and 4\n(d) 1 and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.  While states may contribute, they are not the sole funders.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While a significant number of FTSCs are dedicated to POCSO cases (ePOCSO courts), they also handle other rape cases.  Their jurisdiction is not exclusively limited to POCSO.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for the implementation of the FTSC scheme.\n\nStatement 4 is correct.  The core objective of FTSCs is to ensure the speedy disposal of cases under the POCSO Act and other rape cases, addressing the issue of long delays in the justice system.\n\n\n\n4. Consider the following aspects of India's fiscal federalism:\n\n1.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union are entirely assigned to the states.\n2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states.\n3.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union.\n4.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states as per Article 275.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the principles and mechanisms of fiscal federalism in India?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 2, 3, and 4\n(c) 1 and 3\n(d) 3 and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  The Union levies and collects various taxes, but these are not entirely assigned to the states.  A significant portion is shared between the Union and the states based on recommendations from the Finance Commission.  Some taxes are wholly assigned to states (Article 269), but not all.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the states. Horizontal devolution is the distribution among states.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending the principles governing the distribution of Union taxes between the Union and the states (Article 270) and also the distribution of GST (Article 269A).\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution provides for the Union government to make grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements regarding the Special Category Status (SCS):\n\n1.  The SCS is a permanent classification granted to states.\n2.  The allocation of SCS is based solely on geographical disadvantages.\n3.  The Fifth Finance Commission first introduced the concept of SCS.\n4.  States granted SCS receive special financial assistance from the Centre.\n\nHow many of these statements accurately describe the Special Category Status?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The SCS is not a permanent status; it can be reviewed and potentially withdrawn.  It's a classification granted for a specific period, often subject to review by subsequent Finance Commissions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The allocation of SCS is not based solely on geographical disadvantages. It considers both geographical and socio-economic factors, aiming to assist states facing significant developmental challenges.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Fifth Finance Commission recommended the introduction of the SCS in 1969.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. States granted SCS receive special financial assistance and concessions from the Central government, helping them bridge the development gap.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):\n\n1. It is a constitutional body.\n2. Its primary function is to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.\n3. It submits its reports to the President of India.\n4. It has the power to summon witnesses and examine evidence.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the NCSC\u2019s powers and functions?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately describe aspects of the NCSC.  It is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution of India.  Its main function is indeed to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and to safeguard their rights.  It submits its reports to the President, and it possesses the power to summon witnesses and examine evidence as part of its investigative mandate.  These are crucial powers that allow it to function effectively.\n\n\n7. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):\n\n1. It is a constitutional body.\n2. It is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination.\n3. It advises the government on matters related to recruitment.\n4. Its members are appointed by the Prime Minister.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate regarding the UPSC?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Constitution. It conducts the Civil Services Examination, arguably the most important recruitment examination in India, and advises the government on matters of recruitment and other related services.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:\n\n1. It was enacted in October 2005.\n2. It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.\n3. The Department of Personnel and Training is the coordinating agency.\n4. It mandates that all information held by public authorities must be disclosed.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the RTI Act?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act was enacted in June 2005 and came into force in October 2005.  The enactment and enforcement dates are distinct.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005 replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, significantly strengthening access to information rights.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions acts as the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The RTI Act allows for the exemption of certain information in the interest of national security, public order, and other specified grounds.  Not all information held by public authorities is mandatorily disclosed.\n\n\n9. Consider the following about the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC):\n\n1. It is a constitutional body.\n2. Its primary function is to prevent corruption in government.\n3. It has the power to investigate complaints against government officials.\n4. Its recommendations are binding on the government.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the CVC?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The CVC is a statutory body, established by an act of Parliament, not a constitutional body.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Preventing corruption in government is the CVC's primary mandate.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The CVC has the power to investigate complaints against government officials and take appropriate action.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The CVC's recommendations are not legally binding on the government; however, they carry significant weight, and the government generally gives them due consideration.\n\n\n10. Consider the following concerning the Law Commission of India:\n\n1. It is a constitutional body.\n2. It is responsible for reviewing and recommending changes to laws.\n3. It is appointed by the President of India.\n4. Its recommendations are binding on the Parliament.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the Law Commission's role and composition?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Law Commission is a non-constitutional body established by the government through executive orders.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Law Commission's main role is to review and recommend changes to existing laws and propose new legislation.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Law Commission is appointed by the President of India on the advice of the government.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Law Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on Parliament; they are advisory in nature.  Parliament has the discretion to accept or reject its recommendations.\n\n\n11. Consider the following about NITI Aayog:\n\n1. It replaced the Planning Commission.\n2. It is a constitutional body.\n3. It functions as an advisory body to the government.\n4. It primarily focuses on centralized planning.\n\nHow many of the statements correctly describe NITI Aayog?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, shifting the focus from centralized planning to cooperative federalism.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is a statutory body, established by a resolution of the government, not a constitutional body.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. NITI Aayog functions as a think tank and provides policy recommendations to the government on various developmental aspects.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. NITI Aayog promotes cooperative federalism and emphasizes decentralized planning, involving states in the policy-making process.\n\n\n12. Consider the following about the Universal Postal Union (UPU):\n\n1. It is a specialized agency of the United Nations.\n2. Its primary function is to regulate international postal services.\n3. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n4. India is not a member of the UPU.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the UPU?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, working to coordinate and improve postal services globally.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Regulating international postal services and ensuring their efficiency and interoperability is a core function of the UPU.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The UPU's headquarters is indeed located in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. India is a member of the UPU and actively participates in its activities.\n\n\n13. Consider the following features of the Telecommunications Act, 2023:\n\n1. It repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\n2. Spectrum allocation is primarily through auction.\n3. It mandates strict regulation of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.\n4. It establishes a new Digital Bharat Nidhi.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, repeals the outdated Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, to accommodate the advancements in the telecom sector.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Act emphasizes spectrum allocation primarily through auctions, promoting transparency and efficiency in resource allocation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Act does *not* mandate strict regulation of OTT platforms.  It leaves the regulation of OTT platforms to other relevant laws and authorities.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The act expands the scope of the Universal Service Obligation Fund to create a Digital Bharat Nidhi, supporting the development and expansion of telecom services.\n\n\n14. Consider the following statements about the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):\n\n1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is a nodal agency for grievance redressal in the Union Government.\n2.  CPGRAMS is an offline platform for lodging grievances.\n3.  State-level grievance redressal mechanisms are exclusively handled by Zila Panchayats.\n4.  Initiatives like PRAGATI and e-Nivaran are aimed at improving grievance redressal.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately depict the aspects of the GRM in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. DARPG is one of the designated nodal agencies in the Union Government for handling grievances.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is an online platform, providing 24x7 access for lodging grievances.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Zila Panchayats may have their own grievance mechanisms, state-level grievance redressal is not exclusively handled by them.  District Magistrates and other bodies also play a role.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. PRAGATI and e-Nivaran are examples of initiatives aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of grievance redressal mechanisms.\n\n\n15.  Consider the following regarding internet shutdowns in India:\n\n1. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017, govern internet shutdowns.\n2. Internet shutdowns can be ordered indefinitely.\n3. The Supreme Court has held that internet freedom is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a).\n4.

The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, are the primary legal framework governing temporary suspension of telecom services, including internet shutdowns.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court has explicitly ruled that indefinite suspension of internet services is impermissible.  Shutdowns must be for a temporary duration only, justified by compelling reasons.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* affirmed that freedom of speech and expression through the internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a).\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While the Union Home Secretary can issue such orders, so can state-level home secretaries, depending on the scope of the shutdown.\n\n\n16. Consider the following provisions of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023:\n\n1. It replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n2.

It defines organized crime to include activities like kidnapping and extortion.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the key provisions of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC), not the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).  The IPC remains in effect.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The new act mandates forensic investigation for offences with a minimum sentence of seven years.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The act introduces provisions for the release of undertrials on bail after serving one-third or half of their maximum sentence, depending on the circumstances.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The act defines organized crime, including activities like kidnapping, extortion, and other specified offenses.  This is a crucial aspect of modernizing criminal law.\n\n\n17. Consider the following regarding the Consumer Protection Act:\n\n1. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) can impose penalties for misleading advertisements.\n2. Consumer mediation cells are established only at the national level.\n3. Product liability actions can be taken against manufacturers.\n4. The CCPA's jurisdiction extends to online transactions only.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The CCPA has the power to impose significant penalties on manufacturers and endorsers for misleading advertisements.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Consumer mediation cells are established at the Central, State, and District levels to facilitate dispute resolution.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The act allows for product liability actions against manufacturers and service providers for defective products or services.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The CCPA's jurisdiction extends to both online and offline transactions, covering a wide range of consumer disputes.\n\n\n18. Consider the following about the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):\n\n1.  It regulates the acceptance of foreign contributions by NGOs.\n2.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for administering the FCRA.\n3.  Diversion of foreign funds for anti-national activities can lead to FCRA registration cancellation.\n4.  All foreign contributions are unconditionally permitted.\n\nHow many of the statements accurately describe the FCRA?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The FCRA regulates the acceptance and utilization of foreign contributions by various organizations, including NGOs.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the primary authority responsible for administering the FCRA, granting registrations, and monitoring compliance.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Diversion of foreign funds for activities deemed anti-national or against the public interest can lead to the denial or cancellation of FCRA registration.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The FCRA imposes restrictions and conditions on the acceptance and utilization of foreign contributions to ensure they are used for the stated purposes and do not pose a risk to national security or public order.\n\n\n19. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:\n\n1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.\n2.  Sikkim is partially a Restricted Area.\n3.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas.\n4.  Citizens of Bhutan require special permits to visit Protected Areas.\n\nHow many of these statements accurately describe the regulations related to Protected and Restricted Areas in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Part of Sikkim is designated as a Restricted Area, while another part is a Protected Area.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Foreigners, except for citizens of Bhutan, generally require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Citizens of Bhutan are generally exempt from needing special permits to visit Protected Areas, reflecting the special relationship between India and Bhutan.\n\n\n20. Consider the following regarding passports issued in India:\n\n1.  The Central Government can exempt certain individuals from the requirement of possessing a passport.\n2.  Passports are issued only to Indian citizens.\n3.  Diplomatic passports are blue in color.\n4.  Ordinary passports are maroon in color.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the issuance and types of passports in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Central Government has the power to exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement based on public interest or other considerations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Central Government can issue passports to non-citizens in exceptional circumstances, such as for public interest reasons.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Diplomatic passports are typically white in color.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. Ordinary passports are typically blue in color.  Maroon is associated with official passports.\n"

The subtle difference between Articles 141 and 142 is a key distractor designed to test deep understanding of constitutional provisions.\n"
