Civil contempt focuses on the defiance of court orders, decrees, or processes, essentially a failure to comply with the court's directives. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, encompasses actions that undermine the court's dignity, authority, or the administration of justice.  This includes publications that scandalize the court or interfere with judicial proceedings.  The two types of contempt have different implications and penalties.\n\nStatement 2 is partially incorrect.  While Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, inherent powers to punish contempt, this power is not exclusively limited to these higher courts.  Subordinate courts also possess the power to punish for contempt, though their jurisdiction and the nature of the contempt they can punish might be more restricted compared to the higher courts.  The power of subordinate courts to punish for contempt is derived from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and related legal provisions.\n"

The alignment with the 74th Amendment reflects the incorporation of certain aspects of local governance into the management of cantonments.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This reflects the military's significant role in the administration and governance of these areas.  The Station Commander's presidency ensures military oversight and coordination within the cantonment's administration.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction does *not* mandate a purely literal interpretation of statutes, ignoring contextual meaning.  Instead, it emphasizes interpreting different provisions of a statute in a way that gives effect to all provisions, avoiding contradictions or inconsistencies.  The doctrine aims to provide a coherent and meaningful interpretation of the entire statute.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court frequently employs the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to resolve conflicts or inconsistencies between different provisions of a statute.  This approach prioritizes giving effect to all provisions of the law to the extent possible, seeking a harmonious interpretation that avoids rendering any provision meaningless or redundant.  The doctrine is a vital tool for judicial interpretation in resolving ambiguities and promoting a coherent legal framework.\n"

The regulation of OTT platforms is a complex issue, and currently, there is no single, all-encompassing law governing them.  Various ministries and regulatory bodies have a role, leading to a fragmented regulatory landscape. The statement inaccurately attributes a specific regulatory role to the Act.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting plays a significant role in regulating the content of OTT platforms (through self-regulatory bodies and guidelines), it is not solely responsible.  Other ministries and agencies also have overlapping jurisdiction, depending on the specific aspects of OTT platform operations. This makes the statement an oversimplification of a complex regulatory structure.  The regulatory landscape for OTT platforms is multifaceted and evolving.\n"

This interpretation extends the scope of the right to life beyond mere physical survival.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct because the judgment implicitly broadened the understanding of Article 14 (right to equality).

The grants were historically based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula but this was not a constitutional provision.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

The Union government, however, has the power to borrow both domestically and internationally (Article 292).  The difference highlights the asymmetrical power distribution within the fiscal framework.\n"

The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, and in exceptional circumstances, could potentially intervene if procedural irregularities or fundamental rights violations are demonstrated in the process leading to the President's decision.  The Supreme Court's curative petition mechanism also offers a final avenue for redressal in extremely rare circumstances. Therefore, the President's decision is not absolutely final and binding.\n"

The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), launched in 2021, is a component of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) \u2013 Mission Karmayogi.  The primary guiding principle is a shift from a competency-driven approach to a role-based approach.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the historical basis for calculating grants given to states with SCS. This formula considered several factors to allocate funds, although it has since been superseded by newer allocation methods based on the recommendations of subsequent Finance Commissions.

The doctrine of harmonious construction aims to interpret conflicting laws in a way that preserves the essence and spirit of *both*, not to discard one entirely. This approach emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistency and coherence within the legal system.  The goal is reconciliation, not elimination.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The origins of the doctrine of harmonious construction are indeed linked to the first amendment made in the *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India* judgment. This landmark case significantly influenced the development of the doctrine and its application in resolving legal conflicts. The case's impact on legal interpretation is widely recognized.\n"

This distribution is based on multiple factors, including income distance, area, population (2011 census data), demographic performance, forest cover and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  These criteria aim to balance the needs of different states and promote equitable resource allocation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can only borrow within the country.  Furthermore,  if a state is already indebted to the Union government, it requires the Union's prior consent for any further borrowing, even within India.  This provision is designed to maintain fiscal discipline and prevent excessive state debt.  The Union government's oversight is crucial in maintaining macroeconomic stability.\n"

The statement incorrectly presents an absolute right to information.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, actually *reduced* the independence of Information Commissioners at the central and state levels.  It gave the central government more power to determine the terms and conditions of their employment, including salaries and allowances.

The Act explicitly states that the state government appoints the Nyayadhikari *in consultation with the High Court*. This collaborative approach ensures that the appointed individuals possess the necessary judicial expertise and uphold the standards of the judicial system. The High Court's involvement safeguards against potential biases and ensures the integrity of the Gram Nyayalaya's judicial processes.

While several articles (371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J) provide special provisions for certain states,  there's no single article defining the SCS designation. The categorization historically arose based on various factors like geographical location, economic backwardness, and strategic importance.  Article 370 specifically dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which is distinct from the broader concept of SCS.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was a significant factor in determining central grants to SCS, it wasn't the *sole* determinant. Other factors, such as the state's specific needs and developmental priorities, also played a role in the allocation of funds.  The formula itself was subject to revisions and modifications over time, reflecting the evolving needs of the states concerned.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS categorization and the associated funding pattern.\n"
