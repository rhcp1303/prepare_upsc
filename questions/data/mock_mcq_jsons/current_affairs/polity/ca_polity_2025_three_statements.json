The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the High Court, and they are deemed to be a court of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.\n3.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction, their jurisdiction is limited to petty disputes.  Heinous crimes fall outside their purview.  Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Nyayadhikari is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the High Court, and the Gram Nyayalaya is deemed to be a court of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class. This ensures a degree of judicial oversight and maintains the integrity of the judicial process within the village-level court system.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the technicalities of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. This is intended to simplify proceedings and make them more accessible to the common person. However, they are strictly bound by the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and impartiality in their judgments. The principles of natural justice include the right to a fair hearing, the right to be heard, and the right to a decision without bias.\n"

Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is explicitly prohibited under Article 341(2) of the Constitution.\n3.

This ruling acknowledges the heterogeneity within the SC community and the need for targeted interventions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Article 341(2) allows Parliament to include or exclude castes from the Scheduled Castes list, but it does not explicitly prohibit sub-classification within the existing list. The Supreme Court's ruling clarifies that sub-classification is not a violation of this article, provided it is done to address backwardness and is not based on arbitrary criteria.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Substantive equality, as opposed to formal equality, aims to address the underlying social and economic disadvantages faced by marginalized groups.  Sub-classification within the SC community seeks to achieve substantive equality by ensuring that the most deprived sections receive targeted benefits to overcome historical injustices and achieve a more level playing field.\n"

While coalition governments are possible, they are generally less common and less prone to frequent changes in leadership compared to PR systems which often produce fragmented legislatures requiring complex coalition arrangements.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. PR systems aim to achieve proportionality in representation, but perfect proportionality is rarely achieved in practice.  Various factors, such as electoral thresholds and the specific formula used for seat allocation, can lead to some deviations from perfect proportionality.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The core difference in voting lies in the object of the vote.  In FPTP, the voter chooses a specific individual candidate, while in PR systems, voters generally cast their ballot for a political party, influencing the party's overall seat allocation based on its share of the vote.\n"

A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  It serves as a final check against potential miscarriage of justice.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice. This power allows the court to address exceptional situations where there may be a demonstrable failure of justice.  It's a discretionary power exercised sparingly.\n\n"

Both civil and criminal contempt are defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and are punishable under Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.\n2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or interfere with the administration of justice.\n3.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, does define both civil and criminal contempt.  However, while Articles 129 and 215 grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt, the statement's phrasing implying a singular definition within the Act is slightly misleading.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is accurately described. Civil contempt focuses on the defiance of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct justice.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the different types of actions that can lead to contempt charges.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts possess the inherent power to punish for contempt of court, as explicitly granted by Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution. This power is essential for upholding the authority and integrity of the judicial system at both the national and state levels.\n"

Various PR systems utilize different formulas, and factors like electoral thresholds can influence the final seat distribution, leading to deviations from perfect proportionality.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  FPTP systems frequently underrepresent smaller parties, as even if they receive a substantial number of votes, they may not win any seats if they fail to secure a plurality in any constituency.

The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are mandated to be published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, ensuring transparency and accessibility for all stakeholders.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does aim to accelerate people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs), it explicitly involves all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District) and various stakeholders, including elected representatives, government frontline workers, and community-based organizations.  The focus isn't solely on Gram Panchayat-level elected representatives.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, Gram Sabhas, Block Sabhas, and District Sabhas are integral to the Abhiyan's process. These gatherings facilitate the identification of thematic developmental gaps, utilizing the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) as a crucial tool for assessment.  The PDI's multi-domain and multi-sectoral nature ensures a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan mandates the publication of approved GPDPs on the e-Gram Swaraj portal. This ensures transparency and accessibility, allowing for public scrutiny and accountability in the planning and implementation process.\n"

The rules provide for the constitution of a committee to investigate instances of unfair means only if there is suspicion of involvement by the examination board itself.\n3. The rules apply to all public examinations conducted in India, regardless of the examination body or the level of examination (e.g., school, college, or professional exams).\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The rules empower the venue-in-charge to take appropriate action, including filing an FIR, if a prima facie case of unfair means is detected. The statement restricts the power to file an FIR to only the examination board.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The rules provide for a committee to be constituted even if there is involvement of the management or board of directors of the service provider conducting the examination. The statement unnecessarily restricts the applicability of the committee formation.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct, in that the rules apply to public examinations. However, the scope might be limited to those examinations under the purview of the  Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, not necessarily all public examinations conducted in India.  This makes the statement too broad.  Therefore, none of the statements are completely accurate.\n"

The CAA explicitly *excludes* certain tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura (those included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution) and areas under Inner Line Permits (Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland) from its purview.

While the President's power is significant, it is not entirely absolute.  The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review and can potentially review the exercise of the President's pardoning power if it is found to be arbitrary or mala fide.  There are certain limitations and judicial oversight mechanisms in place, though these are not often invoked.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The President is not bound to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President has the power to act independently, although the convention is that the President usually follows the advice.

The statement claims that states' revenue sources cover approximately 59% of revenue expenditure and that the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 30%. While the debt-to-GDP ratio for states was around 27.5% in March 2023 (as per the provided text), the percentage of revenue expenditure covered by state revenue sources was closer to 58% (as per the provided text) not 59%.  The slight discrepancy in the figures makes the statement factually incorrect.\n"

ADCs have a maximum of 30 members, with 26 elected and 4 nominated by the Governor, while ARCs are established to cater to specific tribal groups within an autonomous district.\n3.

Puttaswamy* case (2017) acknowledges its roots in the \"right to oblivion\" principle established in French jurisprudence. This principle emphasizes an individual's right to control the dissemination of personal information, particularly in the context of outdated or irrelevant data.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The RTBF, while a significant aspect of the right to privacy under Article 21, is not absolute.  Courts will balance this right against other legitimate interests, such as freedom of expression, historical accuracy, and public interest.  There are limitations and exceptions to the RTBF, meaning it's not an unqualified right to have all personal data erased.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, while aiming to protect digital personal data, notably does *not* explicitly include a \"right to be forgotten\" provision.  This omission is a significant point of discussion and potential future amendment within the Indian legal landscape.  The Act focuses on other data protection mechanisms.\n"

Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) cardholders, and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders are not eligible for an ILP and must apply for a different permit.  This restriction highlights the system's focus on regulating entry into sensitive areas.\n\n"

The Lok Sabha's Committee of Privileges has 15 members. This detail is often confused, making it a good distractor. The core function of both committees remains the same: investigating breaches of parliamentary privileges.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was indeed established in 1921, a crucial point in the evolution of Indian parliamentary oversight.  The composition of the PAC, with its representation from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, reflects the bicameral nature of the Indian Parliament.  The maximum number of members is 22 (15 from Lok Sabha and 7 from Rajya Sabha).\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) was established as per the Official Languages Act, 1963 and later detailed in 1976. The method of election using the single transferable vote system ensures proportional representation within the committee,  a key element often tested in UPSC exams. The membership accurately reflects the numbers mentioned in the statement.  The specific numbers and election method are important details frequently missed.\n"

However, the statement inaccurately states that the 15th FC allocated 41% to the states and the Union retained 59%.  While the 41% figure is correct for the states' share, the remaining percentage is distributed among other factors, not solely retained by the Union.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Article 292 grants the Union the power to borrow domestically and internationally, while Article 293 allows states to borrow only within India, with conditions attached for indebted states requiring prior Union consent.  This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Indian federal system.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While Article 275 governs grants-in-aid, the allocation is not primarily based on states' contribution to the national GDP. The criteria for allocating grants-in-aid are far more complex and consider various factors including the states' developmental needs, financial capabilities, and other socio-economic indicators.\n"

It has faced deferrals in recent years, highlighting concerns about its functioning and compliance with international standards.  The statement presents an inaccurate picture of the NHRC's accreditation history. Statement 3 is correct. The NHRC's investigative powers and its ability to make recommendations to the government are accurately described.

The Union Government, however, has the power to borrow both domestically and internationally (Article 292).\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union Government to make grants-in-aid to states.

This formula attempted to account for the specific circumstances of these states, which often faced geographical disadvantages or socio-economic challenges that hindered their development.

While diplomatic and official passports are indeed issued, they are not exclusively for Indian citizens; they can be issued to foreign diplomats and officials. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the ordinary passport is blue, there's no standard \"emergency passport\" that is green.  Emergency travel documents might exist but aren't necessarily a formally recognized passport type with a specific color. The ability of the Indian government to issue passports to non-citizens underscores the complexities of international relations and the need for flexibility in dealing with various situations.  The understanding of passport types and their issuance process is vital for understanding the intricacies of Indian immigration and foreign policy.  Furthermore, the lack of a standardized \"emergency passport\" highlights the practical realities of international travel and the adaptability required in the passport issuance system.\n"
