This is a well-established fact in Indian electoral history.  The MCC is a set of guidelines aimed at ensuring free and fair elections.\n\nOption 2 is incorrect.  Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) manufactures EVMs, but it falls under the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry of Home Affairs primarily deals with internal security, while the Ministry of Defence is responsible for the country's defence and armed forces. BEL's involvement in EVM production is a crucial aspect of India's electoral process, highlighting the technological advancements in election management.\n\nOption 3 is also incorrect.  While ECIL is involved in supplying VVPATs, it operates under the Department of Atomic Energy, not the Department of Space. The Department of Atomic Energy focuses on nuclear energy and related technologies, whereas the Department of Space deals with space exploration and research.  The distinction between these departments is important to understand the organizational structure of government agencies in India.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nPair 1 is correctly matched. The Finance Commission plays a pivotal role in the Indian federal system by recommending the vertical and horizontal devolution of resources between the Union and State governments.  Article 270 of the Constitution provides the constitutional basis for this crucial function.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission significantly influence the fiscal balance between the Centre and the States.\n\nPair 2 is also correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission indeed allocated 41% of the divisible pool to the states.  It employed a multi-faceted approach, considering various factors to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources among the states. The weighting assigned to different criteria reflects the Commission's attempt to balance various developmental needs and fiscal capacities of the states.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money *within* India, not outside. The restriction on borrowing from foreign sources is a crucial aspect of India's fiscal management, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability and preventing excessive external debt.\n"

This decision marked a significant shift in the approach to providing financial assistance to states, moving towards a more performance-based and needs-based allocation of resources. The discontinuation of SCS does not mean that these states do not receive special funding, but the funding is provided based on other criteria and recommendations.\n\n"

The Supreme Court's judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI* upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but also imposed significant limitations on its use, notably concerning data protection and the right to privacy.  This decision underscores the importance of judicial review in safeguarding fundamental rights in the context of technological advancements.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 does not include the \"right to be forgotten,\" a concept found in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This reflects the government's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending.  The reforms aim to streamline the process, reduce overlap, and ensure better alignment with national priorities.\n\nPair 2 is also correctly matched. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish the Plan-Non Plan distinction in the budget had a profound impact on the structure of central government transfers to states.  The shift towards CSSs as the primary mode of specific purpose transfers reflects a move towards greater flexibility and efficiency in resource allocation.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect.  The funding pattern for core schemes in the eight North Eastern States and three Himalayan states is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 60:40. This differential funding pattern reflects the government's commitment to addressing the unique developmental challenges faced by these regions.

Therefore, option 2 is correct. Option 1 is incorrect as Article 72 covers a broader range of offenses. Article 142 is not directly related to granting mercy petitions; its primary focus is the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, as correctly stated in option 4.

Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The NITI Aayog did indeed initiate a process for revamping Centrally Sponsored Schemes, making statement 2 correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, did amend the RTI Act to exempt certain personal information from disclosure, thus statement 3 is correct. FTSCs are indeed used to handle cases under the POCSO Act, but their establishment is not solely limited to this act.

Crucially, curative petitions are a final remedy, only available after other avenues like review petitions have been exhausted.\n\n3. **Incorrect:**  An apprehension of bias, while a valid ground, requires more than just suspicion.

This demonstrates how the MCC, despite its non-statutory nature, exerts influence on electoral conduct.

These acts established Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), respectively, playing a significant role in decentralization.\n\n* **Pair 4:**  The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 are the historical origin of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, designed to regulate access to certain areas in Northeast India.

Special Category Status (SCS) was indeed a classification used to provide additional financial and developmental assistance to states facing socio-economic challenges, based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions; it was discontinued after the 14th Finance Commission. Special financial packages are discretionary grants under Article 282, not always tied to a specific need.

Article 371 provides for special provisions for certain states, enabling tailored approaches to their unique circumstances.

However, the second pair is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly mention Special Category States in a single article like Article 370 (which dealt with J&K's special status, now revoked).  While the Constitution provides for special provisions under Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J for various states,  there's no single constitutional article defining or granting SCS status. This is a crucial distinction that highlights the difference between constitutional provisions and administrative classifications.

This includes the power to commute a death sentence. Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. This is a crucial aspect of the judicial review process, ensuring the Supreme Court can correct any errors or inconsistencies in its decisions.  Article 142 of the Constitution vests the Supreme Court with the power to do complete justice in any case before it, and this power is often invoked to ensure that the ends of justice are served. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution, added through the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985, introduced the anti-defection law, which aims to prevent legislators from changing their party affiliations for personal gain.

Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. Article 142 is a crucial provision that allows the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary for doing complete justice in any case before it, including issuing directions or writs. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights.  Article 226 similarly empowers High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal rights.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.

Multiple ministries and agencies are involved in its implementation.  This question tests understanding of the key players involved in the implementation and oversight of major government schemes and Acts.  The distractor in option 2 is designed to test the candidate's nuanced understanding of the Aadhaar ecosystem.\n"

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases, including death sentences and court-martial convictions. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  Foreigners Tribunals, established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, possess the sole authority to declare an individual a foreigner. The President's power to consider mercy petitions extends to death sentences and court-martial convictions, as explicitly mentioned in Article 72. Finally, the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) were established to expedite the disposal of cases related to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.\n\n"
