Its founding members aimed to promote the use of gold and represent the gold mining industry's interests globally.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The WGC does not regulate gold prices.  Gold prices are determined by supply and demand in the global market, influenced by factors such as investment demand, industrial usage, and central bank activity. The WGC's role is to provide information, analysis, and research related to the gold market, not to directly control prices.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. A significant part of the WGC's activities involves conducting research on gold markets and exploring unique gold market segments. This includes analyzing market trends, investment patterns, and the overall economic impact of gold.  This research informs its publications and presentations to investors and stakeholders.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The WGC is an independent organization, not a subsidiary of the United Nations or any other governmental body.  It operates as a global industry group, funded by its member companies and supported by the gold industry as a whole.  Its independence allows it to provide objective analyses and research without political influence.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.\n\n"

The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as a global leader in this sector.\n3.  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme specifically targets the technical textiles industry.\n4.  Mandatory usage of technical textiles has been implemented across all Central ministries and departments.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.  India's technical textiles market holds the fifth-largest position globally. The National Technical Textiles Mission has the explicit goal of making India a leading player in the international technical textiles arena. The PLI scheme is designed to boost domestic production of technical textiles. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While several Central ministries/departments have been mandated to use technical textiles, this is not a universal policy encompassing all such entities. The implementation is selective, not comprehensive.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI):\n\n1.  The ICI includes the production of automobiles.\n2.  Petroleum refinery products have the lowest weight in the ICI calculation.\n3.

The ISI mark is a voluntary certification for all products sold in India.\n2. The BIS was established under the BIS Act of 2006.\n3. The ISI mark is mandatory for products like cement and electrical appliances.\n4.  The BIS solely focuses on the ISI mark and does not handle other standards.\n\n\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 3 and 1 are incorrect. The ISI mark is mandatory for certain products (like those listed), but not all products sold in India.  The BIS was established under the BIS Act of 2016, not 2006. The BIS manages other standards beyond the ISI mark, including the Hallmark and Eco Mark. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following aspects of India's FMCG sector and the concept of \"Green Shoots\":\n\n1.  The term \"Green Shoots\" refers to signs of economic decline after a period of growth.\n2.

Detergents and toiletries are examples of FMCG products.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. \"Green Shoots\" indicate growth after an economic downturn, not decline. The RBI highlighted the rural economy, not the urban economy, as the source of Green Shoots in the FMCG sector.  FMCG products are characterized by high turnover and a short consumption cycle, not necessarily short shelf life.  However, statement 4 is correct: detergents and toiletries are typical FMCG products. Therefore, only three statements are incorrect; making three correct.\n\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements about India's textile sector growth and initiatives:\n\n1. India's textile sector is projected to reach USD 400 billion by 2030.\n2.

VisioNxt is a fashion forecasting initiative launched by a private company.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 4 are incorrect. India's textile sector is projected to reach USD 350 billion, not USD 400 billion by 2030.  VisioNxt was launched by the Union Textile Minister and is a government initiative, not a private company's. Statements 2 and 3 are correct: The Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme provides credit-linked subsidies for modernization and technology upgrades in the textile industry, and SAMARTH addresses the skilled manpower requirements.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding India's deep-sea mining resources:\n\n1. Polymetallic nodules are primarily composed of copper and gold.\n2.

A GIS-based portal has been developed to map seaweed cultivation sites.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 3 are incorrect. Seaweed cultivation is indeed part of aquaculture. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana targets 1 million tonnes, not 2 million tonnes, of seaweed production per year by 2025. Statements 2 and 4 are correct: Seaweed farming contributes to carbon sequestration, and a GIS-based portal has been created to map seaweed cultivation areas.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the Central Silk Board (CSB):\n\n1. The CSB was established in 1958.\n2. Karnataka is the largest silk producer in India.\n3. India produces all four major varieties of silk.\n4.  The CSB operates under the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; the CSB was established in 1948. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CSB operates under the Ministry of Textiles. Statements 2 and 3 are correct: Karnataka is indeed the largest silk producer in India, and India produces all four major silk varieties (Mulberry, Eri, Tassar, and Muga).\n\n\n10. Consider the following about India's agricultural exports and related schemes:\n\n1.  Agricultural exports increased significantly in 2023-24.\n2.

The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme uses a product-country approach.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are incorrect. Agricultural exports declined in 2023-24, and rice constitutes 21% of total exports, not the largest share. Statements 3 and 4 are correct: TIES assists in infrastructure development, including cold chains, and MAI uses a focused product-country approach for export promotion.\n\n\n11. Consider the following regarding Minimum Support Prices (MSP) in India:\n\n1. MSP is only applicable to Kharif crops.\n2. The MSP for all crops is fixed by the Food Corporation of India (FCI).\n3.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) makes recommendations on MSP.\n4.  MSP aims to prevent farmers from distress selling.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are incorrect. MSP covers both Kharif and Rabi crops, and the final decision on MSP is made by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, not the FCI. Statements 3 and 4 are correct: CACP provides recommendations for MSP, and the primary objective of MSP is to protect farmers from distress sales.\n\n\n12. Consider the following about Nidhi Companies in India:\n\n1. Nidhi companies can accept deposits from non-members.\n2.  The minimum number of members required for a Nidhi company is one hundred.\n3.

The regulation of Nidhi companies is governed by the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect; Nidhi companies accept deposits only from their members. Statement 2 is incorrect; the minimum number of members is two hundred, not one hundred.  Statements 3 and 4 are correct: Nidhi companies aim to encourage thrift and savings among their members, and their regulation falls under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n\n13. Consider the following about the World Gold Council (WGC):\n\n1. The WGC was established in 1997.\n2.  The WGC conducts research on gold markets.\n3.  Switzerland was among the leading gold exporters in 2022.\n4.

Integrated Aquaparks were introduced under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), not the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samridhi Yojana. Statement 2 is correct; Aquaparks are designed to bring together various stages of fish farming and related activities. Statement 3 is incorrect. RAS is actively promoted in Aquaparks as a modern and efficient aquaculture method, not discouraged. Statement 4 is correct; Biofloc technology is increasingly used in Aquaparks for its environmental benefits.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY):\n\n1. PMMSY aims to achieve a target of 2 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.\n2. It is an umbrella scheme designed to address various aspects of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors.\n3.  One of the scheme's objectives is to strengthen the value chain in the fisheries sector.\n4. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) is a separate scheme unrelated to PMMSY.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe the PMMSY and its objectives?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While PMMSY promotes seaweed farming, the target is 1 million tons, not 2 million tons, by 2025. Statement 2 is correct; PMMSY is a comprehensive scheme designed to address multiple challenges in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Statement 3 is also correct; strengthening the value chain is a key objective of PMMSY. Statement 4 is incorrect. FIDF is actually a component or a related scheme under the broader umbrella of PMMSY, not a separate, unrelated scheme.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the PMMSY.\n\n"

Consider the following statements regarding the regulation of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:\n\n1.  Capital adequacy is a key parameter for monitoring the financial health of UCBs.\n2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can impose Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) on UCBs that breach specified risk thresholds.\n3.  A UCB exits PCA if it maintains compliance with all risk parameters for two consecutive quarters.\n4.  The RBI\u2019s Malegam Committee (2010) played a crucial role in establishing the regulatory framework for UCBs.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate regarding the regulatory oversight of UCBs?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Capital adequacy is a crucial aspect of banking regulation, ensuring banks have sufficient capital to absorb potential losses.  UCBs are no exception, and their capital levels are closely monitored by the RBI.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The RBI uses PCA as a tool to address financial weaknesses in banks.  If a UCB breaches pre-defined risk thresholds related to capital, asset quality, or profitability, the RBI may impose PCA, which involves restrictions on activities and operations.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  A UCB's exit from PCA typically requires consistent compliance with all relevant risk parameters over four consecutive quarters, not just two. This ensures sustained improvement in the bank's financial health. The RBI needs to be confident that the improvement is not temporary.\n\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct. While the Malegam Committee focused on regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)-MFIs, its recommendations indirectly influenced the regulatory framework for UCBs. However, the committee did not directly set up regulatory frameworks for UCBs.  The RBI's regulations for UCBs are a product of multiple committees and evolving regulatory practices.\n\n\nTherefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4, partially) are accurate.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding Microfinance in India:\n\n1.  SEWA Bank, established in 1974, is India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).\n2.  Microfinance loans, as defined by the RBI, are collateral-free loans to low-income households with an annual income exceeding \u20b9300,000.\n3.  MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.\n4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to \u20b920 lakh under the \u201cTarun Plus\u201d category to those who have successfully repaid previous Tarun loans.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of microfinance in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. SEWA Bank holds the distinction of being India's pioneering MFI.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households with an annual income *up to* \u20b9300,000, not exceeding it.  This is a key defining characteristic distinguishing them from other loan products.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers and the operational costs involved in serving a dispersed client base.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget did indeed enhance the loan limit under PMMY's \"Tarun Plus\" category to \u20b920 lakh for those with a successful repayment history under the \"Tarun\" category.\n\n\nOnly statements 1 and 4 are accurate, making the correct answer (a).\n\n\n3. Consider the following statements about the Human Development Report (HDR):\n\n1. The HDR is released annually by the World Bank.\n2. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a core component of the HDR.\n3. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across several dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.\n4.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is unaffected by inequalities within a country.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the HDR and its associated indices?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The two organizations have distinct mandates and areas of focus.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The HDI is a central component of the HDR, providing a composite measure of human development based on life expectancy, education, and income.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The GII accurately measures gender disparities across various critical dimensions, highlighting the inequalities women face in different societies.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The IHDI explicitly *accounts* for inequalities in health, education, and income within a country.  It adjusts the HDI to reflect the impact of these inequalities, providing a more nuanced picture of human development.  An HDI value unchanged by inequality would imply perfect equality.\n\n\nTherefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):\n\n1. The MPI report is published annually by the World Bank and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).\n2.  The 2024 MPI report indicates that over 1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.\n3.  India had the lowest number of people living in extreme poverty among the countries included in the 2024 MPI report.\n4. The MPI considers only economic indicators to measure poverty.\n\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  The MPI report is jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not the World Bank and OPHI.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The 2024 MPI report did indeed indicate that over 1 billion people were living in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  India, with 234 million people, had the *largest* number of people living in extreme poverty among the countries surveyed, not the lowest.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The MPI uses a multidimensional approach, considering factors beyond just economic indicators. It incorporates various dimensions of poverty, including health, education, and living standards.\n\n\nOnly statement 2 is accurate.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements related to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) within the World Trade Organization (WTO):\n\n1. The AoA was negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in 1994 in Marrakech, Morocco.\n2.  The AoA primarily deals with tariff reduction, but not non-tariff barriers.\n3.  The \"peace clause\" is a permanent solution addressing public stockholding for food security.\n4.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision (2015) eliminated export subsidies for both developed and developing countries.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture?\n\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 1 and 4 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 2 and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The AoA was indeed a product of the Uruguay Round negotiations and was ratified in Marrakech in 1994.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The AoA addresses both tariff and non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade.  \"Tariffication,\" a key element of the AoA, mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The \"peace clause\" is an *interim* solution, not a permanent one, providing temporary protection for countries' public stockholding programs.  A permanent solution remains a point of contention within the WTO.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 did eliminate export subsidies for both developed and developing member countries of the WTO.\n\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.\n\n\n6. Consider the following about India's initiatives to protect Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Genetic Resources (GRs):\n\n1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is a digital repository aimed at preventing biopiracy.\n2.  India's Patent Act, 1970, incorporates the prior informed consent (PIC) mechanism for the use of GRs and TK.\n3. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is unrelated to the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n4. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, primarily protects individual rights over traditional knowledge.\n\nHow many of the statements accurately describe India's measures to safeguard TK and GRs?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The TKDL serves as a crucial tool in preventing biopiracy by providing a readily accessible database of traditional knowledge, thus allowing for easier identification of potential infringements.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. India's Patent Act, 1970, has provisions related to the disclosure of involved GRs and TK, which has elements similar to a Prior Informed Consent (PIC) mechanism,  though it might not be explicitly named as such.  The aim is to ensure that traditional knowledge is not exploited without proper consent and benefit-sharing agreements.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is directly aligned with and implements the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is an international treaty focused on the conservation of biodiversity.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects *collective* rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions, not individual rights.  It safeguards the reputation and distinctiveness of products linked to particular regions.\n\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement:\n\n1.  The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards of intellectual property protection for WTO members.\n2.  The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.\n3.  Disputes under the TRIPS Agreement are settled through mechanisms outside the WTO's dispute settlement system.\n4.  The TRIPS Agreement prohibits compulsory licensing under any circumstances.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe features of the TRIPS Agreement?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards of protection for various forms of intellectual property, ensuring a baseline level of protection across WTO member countries.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement draws heavily upon the established international frameworks provided by WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions, incorporating many of their key provisions.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Disputes arising under the TRIPS Agreement are subject to the WTO's well-established dispute settlement procedures, which provide a mechanism for resolving trade disagreements between member countries.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement actually *allows* for compulsory licensing, particularly in situations concerning public health.  This flexibility allows countries to produce patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent under specific circumstances.\n\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.\n\n\n8. Consider the following related to India's National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):\n\n1. NaBFID's primary objective is to support short-term infrastructure financing in India.\n2.  NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n3.  NaBFID's entire shareholding is currently held by the Government of India.\n4. NaBFID's operations primarily focus on equity financing for infrastructure projects.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate regarding NaBFID?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term*, not short-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing.  The focus is on providing stable, long-term funding for infrastructure projects.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's oversight ensures the financial stability and soundness of NaBFID's operations.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The Government of India currently holds the entire shareholding of NaBFID.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While NaBFID can provide funding through various instruments, its operations are not limited to equity financing. It can utilize a range of financial instruments to support infrastructure development.\n\n\nOnly statement 3 is accurate.\n\n\n9. Consider the following statements concerning India's e-commerce market:\n\n1.  India's e-commerce market is projected to reach $325 billion by 2030, according to Invest India.\n2.  In 2022, the e-commerce sector contributed over 15% of India's total retail market.\n3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.\n4. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create a closed-source e-commerce network.\n\nHow many of the statements correctly reflect aspects of India's e-commerce landscape?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Invest India's projections indicate a significant growth trajectory for India's e-commerce market.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. In 2022, the e-commerce sector contributed approximately 7%, not over 15%, of India's total retail market.  While growing rapidly, it still constitutes a relatively smaller portion of the overall retail market.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India to protect the domestic retail sector.  FDI is allowed in the marketplace model.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. ONDC is designed to be an *open-source* network, promoting greater transparency and interoperability within the e-commerce ecosystem.\n\n\nOnly statement 1 is accurate.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index):\n\n1. The FI-Index includes data from the banking, investment, and insurance sectors, but excludes postal and pension sectors.\n2.

It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in Marrakesh.\n2.  It includes provisions related to market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.\n3.  Tariffication involves converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.\n4.  The \"peace clause\" provides a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) was indeed negotiated during the Uruguay Round and formally adopted in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 1994.  It covers three pillars: market access (including tariffication, the process of converting non-tariff barriers like quotas into tariffs), domestic support (subsidies influencing production and trade), and export subsidies (measures making exports artificially competitive).  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The \"peace clause,\" agreed upon at the Bali Ministerial Conference (MC9), is an *interim* solution to the PSH issue, not a permanent one.  India continues to push for a permanent solution that addresses the concerns of developing countries regarding food security and price support programs.  The AoA's complexities highlight the ongoing tension between developed and developing nations regarding agricultural trade and subsidies.\n\n\n2. Consider the following aspects of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):\n\n1.  It aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion.\n2.  It was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO.\n3.  It grants a transition period to developing countries.\n4.  India is a signatory to this agreement.\n\nWhich of the above statements are incorrect?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n(b) 2 and 4\n(c) 3 only\n(d) 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct; the Geneva Package explicitly aims to reduce harmful fishing subsidies that deplete fish stocks. Statement 3 is also correct; the agreement provides a transition period, particularly for developing and least developed countries, to adjust to the new regulations. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the agreement was adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference, not the 11th.  Crucially, statement 4 is also incorrect;  as of December 2024, the agreement is still short of the required number of ratifications to enter into force, and India is not yet a signatory. The complexities surrounding this agreement reflect the challenges in balancing environmental sustainability with the economic needs of fishing nations, especially developing countries.\n\n\n3. Consider the following features of the WTO\u2019s TRIPS Agreement:\n\n1.  It sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.\n2.  It incorporates provisions from the WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.\n3.  It allows for compulsory licensing under specific circumstances.\n4.  It established a permanent solution for resolving disputes related to IPR.\n\nHow many of the statements above accurately describe the TRIPS Agreement?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) does establish minimum standards for IPR protection across WTO member countries.  It incorporates elements from the Paris and Berne Conventions, providing a framework for international harmonization of IPR laws.  It also includes provisions for compulsory licensing, allowing governments to license patented products or processes without the patent holder's consent under certain conditions, often to address public health concerns. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While TRIPS provides a dispute settlement mechanism through the WTO's general dispute settlement procedures, it doesn't establish a separate, permanent body solely for resolving IPR disputes. The dispute resolution process is integrated within the broader WTO framework.\n\n\n4. Consider the following regarding Public Stockholding (PSH) policies:\n\n1.  PSH allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSP).\n2.  Developed countries generally support higher de minimis limits for PSH.\n3.  The de minimis limits are calculated using a reference price from 1986-88.\n4.  Developing countries advocate for amendments in the formula to calculate price support subsidies.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect the global divide on PSH?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 1, 3, and 4\n(c) 2 and 3\n(d) 1 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are correct representations of the global debate surrounding PSH.  PSH programs do allow governments to purchase crops from farmers at MSPs, providing price support and food security. The de minimis limits, which define the permissible level of subsidies, are indeed calculated using a reference price based on 1986-88 data\u2014a point of contention for developing countries. Developing nations argue that this outdated formula needs revision to allow for higher subsidies to protect their farmers. However, statement 2 is incorrect; developed countries generally *oppose* higher de minimis limits for PSH, arguing that such policies distort markets.  This reflects the core disagreement between developed and developing nations on the balance between food security and trade liberalization.\n\n\n5.  Consider the following concerning India\u2019s agricultural sector:\n\n1.  The Agricultural Export Policy aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.\n2.  Agricultural exports in India declined by 8% in 2023-24.\n3.  MSP covers 24 crops, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 4 commercial crops.\n4.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. India's Agricultural Export Policy did indeed set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, a target that was not met.  Agricultural exports did experience an 8% decline in 2023-24. The CACP plays a crucial role in recommending MSPs to the government. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the MSP covers a significant number of crops, it does not cover 24; the number is actually 22, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (Jute and Copra).  The discrepancy highlights the complexities of India's agricultural policies and the challenges in achieving export targets while ensuring farmer welfare.\n\n\n6. Consider the following statements regarding the \"middle-income trap\":\n\n1.  The World Bank coined the term \"middle-income trap\" in 2007.\n2.  The World Bank classifies economies with per capita GNI between US$1,135 and US$13,846 as MICs.\n3.  India's per capita GDP is currently above US$13,846.\n4.  The \"3i strategy\" proposed by the World Bank involves Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 4\n(b) 1 and 4 only\n(c) 2 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The World Bank did indeed coin the term \"middle-income trap\" around 2007, highlighting the challenge for rapidly growing economies to transition to high-income status.  Their classification of Middle-Income Countries (MICs) based on per capita Gross National Income (GNI) within the specified range is also accurate.  The World Bank's suggested \"3i strategy\" \u2013 Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation \u2013 is a widely discussed approach to escaping the middle-income trap. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's per capita GDP is significantly *below* US$13,846, placing it firmly within the MIC category. The inaccuracy in statement 3 serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of economic indicators.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF):\n\n1.  From independence to economic liberalization, investment remained consistently above 10% of GDP.\n2.  GFCF rose significantly in the 2000s, reaching approximately 27% of GDP in 2007-08.\n3.  Private investment in GFCF has consistently increased since 2011-12.\n4.  GFCF is also known as investment.\n\nHow many of the above statements regarding GFCF are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 2 and 4 are correct.  GFCF did experience substantial growth in the 2000s, peaking around 27% of GDP in 2007-08.  The term GFCF is indeed synonymous with investment in the context of macroeconomic analysis. However, statement 1 is incorrect; investment fluctuated around 10% of GDP during the period from independence to economic liberalization, not consistently above it.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; private investment in GFCF *decreased* significantly from 2011-12 onwards, before showing a recent uptick.  The inclusion of these partially true, yet ultimately incorrect, statements makes this a challenging question, requiring careful attention to detail.\n\n\n8. Consider the following about the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):\n\n1.  Approximately 1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty.\n2.  The MPI includes indicators related to education, health, and living standards.\n3.  India introduced its National MPI (NMPI) in 2020.\n4.  The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).\n\nWhich of the statements above are accurate regarding the MPI?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 1, 2, and 4\n(c) 2, 3, and 4\n(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  Globally, approximately 1 billion people are estimated to be living in acute multidimensional poverty.  The MPI, both globally and in its national adaptations, includes indicators across education, health, and living standards. The NMPI in India does utilize data from the NFHS. However, statement 3 is incorrect; India's NMPI was introduced in 2021, not 2020.  The slight chronological inaccuracy makes this a more challenging question, testing the candidate's precise recall of dates and initiatives.  The inclusion of largely correct, yet slightly inaccurate information, enhances the difficulty level.\n\n\n9. Consider the following initiatives related to India's dairy sector:\n\n1.  \"White Revolution 2.0\" focuses on enhancing milk production through improved breeding practices.\n2.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to improve the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds.\n3.  The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) targets the eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis.\n4.  The Pandemic Fund Project focuses solely on enhancing vaccine manufacturing facilities.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives in India's dairy and animal husbandry sectors?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 1, 2, and 4\n(c) 2, 3, and 4\n(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect ongoing initiatives in India's dairy and animal husbandry sectors. \"White Revolution 2.0\" aims to boost milk production through various means, including improved breeding and technological advancements. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission specifically targets the development and conservation of indigenous cattle breeds.  The NADCP is a significant program aimed at controlling and eradicating FMD and Brucellosis. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Pandemic Fund Project has a broader scope than just vaccine manufacturing; it encompasses enhancing surveillance, data management, and overall institutional capacity related to animal health security. The inclusion of a partially correct, but ultimately inaccurate statement, adds to the question's complexity.\n\n\n10. Consider the following about the Preston Curve:\n\n1.  It was first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975.\n2.  It demonstrates a direct and proportional relationship between per capita income and life expectancy.\n3.  It suggests that increases in per capita income always lead to significant increases in life expectancy.\n4.  It highlights that beyond a certain point, increases in per capita income have diminishing returns on life expectancy.\n\nWhich of the above statements correctly describe the Preston Curve?\n\n(a) 1, 2, and 3\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n(c) 1 and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Preston Curve.  The curve was indeed first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975.  Importantly, it demonstrates that the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy is not linear; beyond a certain level of income, further increases have a diminishing impact on life expectancy.  This is because other factors, such as healthcare access and lifestyle choices, become more significant determinants of life expectancy at higher income levels.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect; the curve doesn't show a direct, proportional relationship, and income increases don't always lead to significant life expectancy increases beyond a certain point.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true but ultimately misrepresent the Preston Curve's core concept increases the question's difficulty.\n"

The World Development Report 2024 focuses on the middle-income trap and its implications for economic growth. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) directly measures multidimensional poverty across countries. The Human Development Report (HDR) examines major global challenges affecting human development, including poverty and inequality, through indices like the HDI and GII.  Therefore, the World Development Report, the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index, and the Human Development Report are all centrally concerned with aspects of economic development, poverty, or inequality.  The Preston curve, while related, is more of a specific analytical tool within the broader context of development analysis.\n"

India is significantly reliant on costly imports of coking coal, primarily from Australia, to meet its steel production needs.  This dependence makes the steel sector vulnerable to price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions in the international market. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's per capita steel consumption is considerably *lower* than the global average and significantly behind China. Statement 3 is false; the steel industry is globally recognized as an extremely energy-intensive and carbon-emitting sector. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India's steel exports to the EU are indeed threatened by the imposition of carbon taxes, creating a significant hurdle for competitiveness in the European market.

The RBI\u2019s role in monitoring UCBs is primarily advisory and not regulatory.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's oversight of UCBs?\n\n",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the RBI's role in overseeing UCBs.  The RBI does monitor key financial indicators and can place underperforming UCBs under PCA.  Statement 3 is partially correct but the condition is for four successive quarters, not two. Statement 4 is incorrect; PCA implementation is based on multiple risk indicators, not just profit decline. Statement 5 is incorrect; the RBI\u2019s role is both regulatory and supervisory, not solely advisory.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the RBI\u2019s oversight mechanisms for UCBs.\n"

        "question_text": "Consider the following related to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India:**\n\n1.  The FI-Index measures the extent of financial inclusion across the country.\n2.  The index has a range from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial inclusion.\n3.  The index includes parameters related to banking, investments, insurance, and pensions.\n4.  The index is published quarterly by the Ministry of Finance.\n5.  A higher FI-Index score always indicates improved access to formal financial services.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the FI-Index?\n",
        "option_a": "Only one\n",
        "option_b": "Only two\n",
        "option_c": "Only three\n",
        "option_d": "Only four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the FI-Index.  It measures financial inclusion, has a 0-100 range, and covers multiple financial sectors. Statement 4 is incorrect; the index is published *annually*, not quarterly, by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Finance. Statement 5 is partially true but oversimplified; while a higher score generally suggests better access, other factors can influence the interpretation.  Therefore, only three statements provide a fully accurate picture of the FI-Index.\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India:\n\n1.  It is published biannually by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n2.  The index uses a single value ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing complete financial inclusion.\n3.  Access, Usage, and Quality are the three broad parameters considered, with Usage having the highest weightage.\n4.  The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually*, not biannually, by the RBI.  Statement 2 is correct. The FI-Index indeed uses a single-value scale from 0 to 100, where 100 signifies complete financial inclusion. Statement 3 is also correct. The three broad parameters are Access, Usage, and Quality, with Usage carrying the highest weightage (45%).  Statement 4 is accurate; the index encompasses data across the specified sectors, providing a holistic view of financial inclusion. Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n\n\n2. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank \u2013 Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):\n\n1.  It was launched in 2022 as a part of the RBI's Alternate Grievance Redressal (AGR) Framework.\n2.  It is established under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n3.  The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to services provided by RBI-regulated entities.\n4.  It covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), irrespective of their asset size.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n(b) 3 only\n(c) 2 and 4\n(d) 1 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RB-IOS is established under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; the RBI Act, 1934; and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, not the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's primary objective is to provide a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances. Statement 4 is incorrect. The scheme does *not* cover all NBFCs; it specifically excludes Housing Finance Companies and only covers those with assets of \u20b9100 crore and above.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.\n\n\n3. Consider the following statements related to India's minimum wage system:\n\n1.  The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, specifies the exact minimum wage for all occupations across all states.\n2.  The Code on Wages, passed in 2019, aims to establish a universal minimum wage floor applicable to all states upon implementation.\n3.  Wage payment discrepancies are absent due to the robust enforcement of the national wage floor across all states.\n4.  India currently follows a \"living wage\" system, ensuring that wages meet the cost of living.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, provides guidelines but *does not* specify a precise minimum wage for all occupations nationwide.  Statement 2 is correct. The Code on Wages aims to establish a universal minimum wage, although its complete implementation across states is still pending. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Significant wage payment discrepancies persist due to the lack of consistent enforcement of a national wage floor. Statement 4 is incorrect.  India currently follows a minimum wage system, not a living wage system.  A living wage is a significantly higher standard that aims to cover the cost of living, which is not currently mandated.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following about Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) in India:\n\n1.  IRDAI designates D-SIIs based solely on their asset size.\n2.  The distress or failure of a D-SII would have minimal impact on the domestic financial system.\n3.  Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has been identified as a D-SII.\n4.  D-SIIs are insurers whose size, market importance, and interconnectedness are such that their failure could significantly disrupt the domestic financial system.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. IRDAI's designation of D-SIIs considers factors beyond just asset size, including market importance and interconnectedness. Statement 2 is incorrect. The failure of a D-SII would indeed cause a significant dislocation within the domestic financial system, justifying their identification and enhanced regulatory oversight. Statement 3 is correct. LIC is among the insurers identified as a D-SII by IRDAI. Statement 4 accurately defines D-SIIs, emphasizing their systemic importance and the potential consequences of their failure.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements concerning Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:\n\n1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding \u20b93,00,000 are classified as microfinance loans.\n2.  MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.\n3.  The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs operating in India.\n4.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations (2010) focused on regulating NBFC-MFIs.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The income limit for loans considered microfinance is *up to* \u20b93,00,000, not exceeding it. Statement 2 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk involved in lending to low-income borrowers. Statement 3 is correct. The RBI is the primary regulatory authority for MFIs in India. Statement 4 is also correct. The Malegam Committee's report significantly contributed to the regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):\n\n1.  It provides loans up to \u20b910 lakh to corporate and farm-related small/micro enterprises.\n2.  Loans under PMMY are categorized into \u2018Shishu\u2019, \u2018Kishore\u2019, and \u2018Tarun\u2019 based on loan amount.\n3.  The 2024 Union Budget reduced the maximum loan limit under PMMY.\n4.  PMMY aims to provide financial inclusion and support to marginalized socio-economic groups.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to *non-corporate* and *non-farm* small/micro enterprises. Statement 2 is correct. The loan categories reflect the stage of growth and funding needs of borrowers. Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2024 Union Budget *increased* the maximum loan limit, introducing a \"Tarun Plus\" category. Statement 4 is correct. The scheme's primary goal is to enhance financial inclusion and support for marginalized communities.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):\n\n1.  An NPA is a loan overdue for more than 180 days.\n2.  Gross NPAs (GNPAs) represent the sum of all loan assets classified as NPAs.\n3.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, is irrelevant to NPA resolution.\n4.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, empowers secured creditors to take possession of collateral in case of loan defaults.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. An NPA is overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days. Statement 2 is correct. GNPA accurately reflects the total value of NPAs. Statement 3 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, plays a crucial role in resolving stressed assets and NPAs, especially for corporate debtors. Statement 4 is correct. The SARFAESI Act provides a legal framework for secured creditors to recover dues through the seizure of collateral. Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements related to the Financial Stability Report (FSR):\n\n1.  The FSR is published annually by the Ministry of Finance.\n2.  It assesses the health of the Indian financial system based on inputs from the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).\n3.  The FSR's assessment is solely based on data from Scheduled Commercial Banks.\n4.  The FSDC is chaired by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The FSR is published *biannually*, not annually, by the RBI. Statement 2 is correct. The FSR's assessment relies heavily on the FSDC's sub-committee's analysis. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the FSR analyzes Scheduled Commercial Banks, it also considers data from other financial institutions to provide a comprehensive overview. Statement 4 is incorrect. The FSDC is chaired by the *Finance Minister*, not the RBI Governor. Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India:\n\n1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce government spending on infrastructure projects.\n2. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs handles policy-level matters related to PPPs.\n3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.\n4. The World Bank\u2019s Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report assesses PPP regulatory landscapes globally.\n\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 3\n(b) 2 and 4\n(c) 1, 2 and 3\n(d) 2, 3 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The NMP aims to *generate investment* by monetising existing government assets, not to reduce government spending.  Statement 2 is correct. The Private Investment Unit plays a key role in PPP policy. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects. Statement 4 is correct. The World Bank report indeed benchmarks PPP regulatory frameworks across many economies. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding Co-lending in India:\n\n1.  Co-lending involves a single lender providing loans to borrowers.\n2.  Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.\n3.  Co-lending helps increase lending capacity and reduce risk for individual lenders.\n4.  As per RBI guidelines, banks must bear at least 80% of the credit risk in co-lending arrangements with NBFCs.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Co-lending involves *multiple* lenders, not a single lender. Statement 2 is incorrect. Banks are *not* allowed to co-lend with NBFCs from their promoter group. Statement 3 is correct. Co-lending effectively diversifies risk and expands lending capacity. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The minimum credit risk for NBFCs is 20%, meaning banks bear at least 80%, not the other way around. Therefore, only two statements are correct.\n\n"

The global MPI, launched in 2010, measures deprivations in education, health, and living standards.\n3. The NMPI includes indicators on maternal health and bank accounts, in addition to the global MPI's indicators.\n4. The World Bank's report, \"Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet,\" indicates a significant increase in global poverty reduction over the past five years.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India's MPI and related poverty reduction efforts?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The NITI Aayog did introduce the NMPI in 2021 using NFHS data. The global MPI measures deprivations as stated.  The NMPI does include the additional indicators mentioned. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The World Bank's report actually highlights a *stalling* of global poverty reduction, not a significant increase, over the past five years.  Therefore, three statements are correct.\n\n\n5. Consider the following statements related to India's agricultural exports and the challenges faced by the sector:\n\n1. India's agricultural exports declined by 8% in 2023-24, falling short of the target set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.\n2. The \"cobweb phenomenon\" refers to the cyclical fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices due to inefficient supply chain management.\n3.  India's agricultural R&D expenditure is significantly higher than that of China and Brazil as a percentage of agricultural GDP.\n4.  The level of mechanization in Indian agriculture is higher than that of China and Brazil.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the current state of India's agricultural exports and the challenges faced by the sector?\n\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are correct.  Agricultural exports did decline as stated, and the \"cobweb phenomenon\" accurately describes the price fluctuations.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. India's agricultural R&D expenditure is actually lower than that of China and Brazil as a percentage of agricultural GDP.  Similarly, the level of mechanization in Indian agriculture is also lower than that of China and Brazil.  This leaves only two accurate statements.\n\n\n6. Consider the following statements about  India's initiatives related to the dairy sector and White Revolution 2.0:\n\n1. The Ministry of Cooperatives released Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on 'White Revolution 2.0'.\n2. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds.\n3. The National Programme for Dairy Development focuses primarily on reducing milk prices for consumers.\n4. Operation Flood was a single-phase initiative led by Dr. Verghese Kurien.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives and aspects of India's dairy sector?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1 and 2 are correct. The Ministry of Cooperatives did release SOPs for White Revolution 2.0, and the Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on indigenous breeds.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The National Programme for Dairy Development aims to enhance milk quality and increase organized milk procurement, not primarily to reduce consumer prices. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Operation Flood was implemented in three phases.  This leaves only two correct statements.\n\n\n7. Consider the following about Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and infrastructure development in India:\n\n1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.\n2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.\n3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce government spending on infrastructure projects.\n4. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report analyzes PPP regulatory landscapes globally.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of PPPs and infrastructure development in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The Private Investment Unit handles policy-level PPP matters. The Appraisal Committee evaluates projects. The World Bank report does analyze global PPP regulatory landscapes.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP aims to *generate investment* by monetizing government assets, not to reduce government spending. This makes three statements correct.\n\n\n8. Consider the following regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its impact on agriculture and food security:\n\n1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, led to the formation of the WTO.\n2. The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) reached a permanent solution to the public stockholding (PSH) issue.\n3. The PSH policy aims to enable governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs).\n4.  \"De minimis limits\" refer to restrictions on the amount of subsidies that developing countries can provide to their farmers.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the WTO and its relation to agriculture and food security?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement did lead to the WTO's formation. The PSH policy aims to enable government procurement at MSPs. \"De minimis limits\" do refer to restrictions on subsidies.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The MC13 did *not* reach a permanent solution to the PSH issue.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.\n\n\n9. Consider the following regarding the \"middle-income trap\" and economic development:\n\n1. The World Bank coined the term \"middle-income trap\" in 2007.\n2. The World Bank's World Development Report 2024 suggests a \"3i strategy\" (Investment, Infusion of global technologies, Innovation) for countries aiming for high-income status.\n3. The Preston Curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between income and life expectancy.\n4.  \"Creative destruction\" refers to the process by which new innovations replace outdated industries, leading to economic transformation.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe concepts related to the \"middle-income trap\" and economic development?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements are accurate. The World Bank did coin the term in 2007. The 3i strategy is proposed in the report. The Preston Curve depicts the income-life expectancy relationship. \"Creative destruction\" accurately describes the innovation-led transformation process.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.\n"

The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its platinum jubilee, marking a significant milestone in the sector's history.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's silk production and the relevant organizations?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately reflect the status of India's silk industry. India's significant global production share is well-documented. Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are consistently major producers. India's diverse silk production across various types is a key feature. The Central Silk Board's platinum jubilee is a significant event marking its long history of supporting the industry. Therefore, all four statements are correct.\n\n\n8. Consider the following statements related to offshore mineral resources in India:\n\n1.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including precious and base metals.\n2. The Geological Survey of India has delineated resources of various minerals in offshore areas, including lime mud, heavy mineral placers, and phosphorite.\n3. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals except mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and certain minerals specified in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.\n4. These rules mandate rigorous exploration standards for the accurate assessment and sustainable development of offshore mineral resources.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the status and regulation of offshore mineral resources in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll four statements accurately reflect the current state of knowledge and regulations regarding offshore mineral resources in India. The vast mineral potential within the EEZ is well-established. The Geological Survey of India's work in delineating resources is a crucial part of resource assessment. The 2024 rules clearly define their scope and exclusions.  The emphasis on rigorous exploration standards underscores the government's focus on sustainable resource management. Therefore, all four statements are correct.\n\n\n9. Consider the following statements about India's financial sector institutions:\n\n1. The Financial Services Institution Bureau (FSIB) is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament.\n2. The FSIB's primary function is to recommend candidates for appointments as whole-time directors in financial services institutions.\n3. Ways and Means Advances (WMA) are long-term loan facilities provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the Government of India.\n4. The interest rate on WMA is always 2% higher than the repo rate.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the roles and functions of these institutions?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOnly two statements are entirely accurate. While the FSIB does recommend candidates for appointments, its exact legal status might need clarification depending on the interpretation of \"statutory body\".  The description of WMA as a long-term loan is incorrect; they are short-term. The interest rate on WMA is not fixed at 2% above the repo rate; it varies. Therefore, only statements 2 is entirely correct. Statement 1 needs further clarification, while statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.\n\n\n\n1. Consider the following statements related to India's agricultural initiatives:\n\n1. KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for yield estimation improvement.\n2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) primarily focuses on weather forecasting data for farmers.\n3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes AI, remote sensing, and GIS for agricultural decision-making.\n\nHow many of the above statements are accurate representations of the respective initiatives?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoinformatics) explicitly aims to improve yield estimation by leveraging space technology and geoinformatics.  This is a key component of its design and implementation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While ADeX does utilize geospatial data, its primary focus is not on weather forecasting.  Instead, it concentrates on compiling and providing farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data\u2014crucial for targeted agricultural services and policy interventions. Weather data might be incorporated as a supplementary dataset, but it's not the core function.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) is explicitly designed to facilitate informed decision-making in agriculture through the application of AI, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  These technologies are integral to its operational framework.\n\n\nTherefore, only two of the three statements are accurate.  The incorrect statement misrepresents ADeX's core functionality, highlighting a common pitfall in understanding the nuanced roles of different agricultural technology platforms.\n\n\n2. Consider the following aspects of Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:\n\n1. MSP is the minimum rate at which farmers sell their crops to private buyers.\n2. MSP covers only Kharif crops, excluding Rabi and commercial crops.\n3. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP without government oversight.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the MSP system?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is the minimum price at which the *government* purchases crops from farmers, not private buyers. This crucial distinction safeguards farmers from distress selling at lower market prices.  The government acts as a buyer of last resort, ensuring a baseline price for their produce.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The MSP system in India covers a wider range of crops than just Kharif crops. It encompasses 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra), along with additional MSPs for Toria and de-husked coconut based on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra, respectively. This broad coverage reflects the government's commitment to supporting diverse agricultural production.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. This process ensures that political and economic considerations are integrated into the MSP determination, reflecting the broader national interest.\n\nConsequently, none of the provided statements accurately depict the MSP system.  The statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding the buying entity, crop coverage, and decision-making authority, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of this critical agricultural policy mechanism.\n\n\n\n3. Consider the following regarding India's Agricultural Export Policy:\n\n1. Agricultural exports in India have consistently increased annually since the policy's inception.\n2. The policy's ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 was achieved.\n3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) solely focuses on improving domestic agricultural infrastructure.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly reflect the performance and components of India's Agricultural Export Policy?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports in India did *not* consistently increase annually after the policy's inception.  In fact, there was an 8% decline in 2023-24, indicating the policy's challenges in achieving consistent growth despite its stated aims. This highlights the complexities of international markets and the need for adaptive strategies in agricultural export promotion.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was *not* achieved.  The shortfall underscores the gap between policy aspirations and on-the-ground realities, highlighting the need for a reassessment of the policy's strategies and targets.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is not solely focused on domestic agricultural infrastructure.  It aims to improve infrastructure with *export linkages*, such as border haats, land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers. This export-oriented focus is essential for facilitating efficient and competitive agricultural exports.\n\n\nTherefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the policy's performance or components.  The statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding export growth, target achievement, and the scope of TIES, demonstrating the need for a thorough understanding of the policy's impact and mechanisms.\n\n\n\n4. Consider the following statements related to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark:\n\n1. The ISI mark is solely managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n2.  The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.\n3. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and managing the ISI mark.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the ISI mark and its governance?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a significant role in promoting standards and quality control, the ISI mark is not solely managed by this ministry. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the primary body responsible for its development and implementation, operating under the overall framework of government policy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The ISI mark is *not* mandatory for all products sold in India.  The Central Government mandates it for *specific* products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), based on considerations of safety, quality, and public interest.  This selective approach ensures that the mandatory application of the ISI mark is targeted and effective.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), established under the BIS Act, 2016, is responsible for developing and managing the ISI mark.  It sets the standards, oversees testing and certification, and ensures that products bearing the mark meet the specified quality and safety requirements.  This role is central to the ISI mark's credibility and effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, only one statement accurately describes the ISI mark and its governance.  The incorrect statements highlight potential misconceptions about the scope of the ISI mark's mandatory application and the specific agency responsible for its management.\n\n\n\n5. Consider the following features of  Household Savings in India:\n\n1. Household savings are categorized solely into financial savings.\n2. A decline in financial savings benefits the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.\n3. The household sector typically invests all its savings internally, without lending to other sectors.\n\nHow many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of household savings in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Household savings in India are categorized into *both* financial savings (currency, deposits, life insurance funds, etc.) and physical savings (physical assets, gold, and silver).  This dual categorization reflects the diverse forms in which households accumulate savings, reflecting both liquid and illiquid assets.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. A decline in financial savings poses *challenges* for the banking sector in maintaining liquidity and managing credit risk.  Financial savings are a crucial source of funds for banks, and their reduction can constrain lending capacity and increase credit risk.  This highlights the interconnectedness of household savings and the stability of the financial system.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. In India, the household sector typically generates *surplus* savings relative to its investments, lending the excess to other sectors of the economy.  This surplus plays a vital role in financing investment and economic growth, contributing to national capital formation.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement is incorrect.  The incorrect statements reveal a misunderstanding of the diverse composition of household savings, their impact on banking sector stability, and the role of household savings in broader economic activity.\n\n\n\n6. Consider the following regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India:\n\n1.  Excise duty under GST applies to all goods and services.\n2. State Excise duty is levied on petroleum products by the Central Government.\n3. The GST Compensation Cess was designed to compensate states for revenue losses due to GST implementation.\n\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the GST system in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  Excise duty under the GST regime does *not* apply to all goods and services.  It primarily applies to petroleum products and alcohol.  Many other forms of excise duty that previously existed were subsumed under the GST, simplifying the tax structure but leaving specific items under the purview of excise duty.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. State Excise duty is levied on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances, not petroleum products. Petroleum products remain subject to central excise duty, reflecting the continuing distinction in tax administration at the central and state levels.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was enacted precisely to levy a Compensation Cess on certain goods, compensating states for revenue losses that might arise from the implementation of the GST. This mechanism aimed to ensure fiscal stability during the transition to the new tax regime.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement is correct.  The incorrect statements demonstrate a lack of clarity on the scope of excise duty under GST and the specific products subject to State Excise duty, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the GST's structure and its implications for different tax categories.\n\n\n\n7. Consider the following statements concerning India's tax treaties and international tax cooperation:\n\n1. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS aims to curb tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).\n2.  The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS was signed by India in 2023.\n3. Pillar One of the BEPS Two-pillar approach focuses on reallocating profits of MNEs to countries where their production takes place.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe India's involvement in international tax cooperation?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a global initiative explicitly designed to combat tax avoidance strategies employed by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  India's participation in this framework underscores its commitment to ensuring fair tax practices globally.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  India signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS in 2017, not 2023.  This date reflects the timeline of India's engagement in this crucial international tax agreement.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Pillar One of the BEPS Two-pillar approach focuses on reallocating profits of MNEs to countries where their *consumers* are present, not where their production takes place.  This consumer-centric approach addresses the challenges of taxing large digital companies that may have minimal physical presence in the jurisdictions where they generate significant revenue.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement is correct. The incorrect statements reveal inaccuracies regarding the timing of India's convention signing and the specific focus of Pillar One in the BEPS framework, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of this complex area of international tax cooperation.\n\n\n\n8. Consider the following features of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:\n\n1.  All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n2.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating methodologies and conflict of interest guidelines.\n3.  The RBI solely regulates all aspects of CRAs' operations in India.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape of CRAs in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While several CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions, not *all* of them are.  Brickwork Ratings, for example, is a notable exception. This highlights the nuanced regulatory overlap between SEBI and RBI in overseeing CRAs' operations.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, clearly mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines on dealing with conflict of interest. This transparency requirement is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of credit ratings.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The RBI does not solely regulate all aspects of CRAs' operations. SEBI also plays a significant regulatory role, particularly concerning the disclosure and transparency requirements of CRAs.  This shared regulatory responsibility reflects the importance of maintaining both financial stability and investor protection in the credit rating sector.\n\nTherefore, only one statement accurately reflects the regulatory landscape of CRAs. The incorrect statements highlight misconceptions about the extent of RBI accreditation among SEBI-registered CRAs and the exclusive nature of RBI's regulatory authority.  This underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the multi-agency regulatory framework governing CRAs in India.\n\n\n9. Consider the following statements regarding Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India:\n\n1. InvITs are exclusively used for investing in residential real estate projects.\n2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) does not regulate InvITs.\n3.  InvITs allow investors to participate in infrastructure projects through relatively low ticket sizes.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe InvITs in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. InvITs are *not* exclusively used for investing in residential real estate.  They primarily focus on infrastructure projects such as toll roads, power lines, and pipelines.  This distinction is crucial in understanding their role in financing large-scale infrastructure development.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) *does* regulate InvITs, setting the framework for their establishment, operations, and investor protection.  This regulatory oversight is essential for ensuring transparency and investor confidence in this investment vehicle.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. InvITs offer a mechanism for investors to participate in infrastructure projects through relatively low ticket sizes.  This accessibility makes infrastructure investment more inclusive, broadening the participation beyond large institutional investors.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement accurately describes InvITs.  The incorrect statements reflect misconceptions about the types of projects InvITs finance and the regulatory oversight they are subject to.  This emphasizes the need for a clear understanding of this important investment vehicle's characteristics and regulatory environment.\n\n\n10. Consider the following about Jute cultivation and related initiatives in India:\n\n1. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) primarily focuses on exporting raw jute.\n2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for all commodities.\n3. JCI's Jute I-CARE project promotes mechanization in jute farming.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of jute cultivation and related initiatives in India?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is a price support agency, not primarily focused on exporting raw jute. Its role is to ensure fair prices for jute farmers and stabilize the market, rather than directly engaging in large-scale export activities.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, does not mandate the use of jute packaging for *all* commodities.  It mandates its use for *specific* commodities, reflecting a targeted approach to promoting jute usage while considering the broader needs of different sectors.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. JCI's Jute I-CARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) Project does indeed aim to promote mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting using microbial consortium.  This initiative reflects a broader effort to improve efficiency and sustainability in jute production.\n\n\nTherefore, only one statement is accurate.  The incorrect statements reveal misunderstandings about JCI's role and the scope of the compulsory jute packaging act, highlighting the need for a more precise understanding of these policies and their implementation.\n"

        "question_text": "Consider the following:**\n\n1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)\n2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)\n3.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)\n4.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)\n5.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)\n\nHow many of the above are primarily concerned with financial regulation, restructuring, or support for specific sectors of the Indian financial system?\n",
        "option_a": "1, 2 and 3\n",
        "option_b": "2, 3 and 4\n",
        "option_c": "3, 4 and 5\n",
        "option_d": "All five\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nNUCFDC is an umbrella organization for urban cooperative banks, involved in regulation and support. The PCA framework for UCBs is a direct regulatory mechanism. PMMY provides financial support to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). ARCs handle the resolution of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the banking system. InvITs facilitate investment in infrastructure projects. Therefore, all five initiatives are directly concerned with financial regulation, restructuring, or support for specific sectors within the Indian financial system, albeit in different capacities. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more relevant initiatives, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the Indian financial landscape. The question tests the candidate's overall understanding of the various mechanisms and institutions that constitute the Indian financial system.  The inclusion of seemingly disparate elements (like PMMY and InvITs) makes the question challenging and ensures that only candidates with a thorough understanding will be able to correctly identify all the relevant options.\n"

Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP)\n4.  Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the WTO\n5.

        "option_c": "Three\n",
        "option_d": "Four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nDRTs handle debt recovery cases. NCLAT deals with appeals related to company law matters. PPIRP provides a framework for insolvency resolution. The AoA of the WTO deals with agricultural trade policies, impacting financial flows and disputes. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies addresses trade related to the fisheries sector.  Therefore, all four of these entities or agreements are directly involved in legal frameworks or international trade agreements related to resolving financial disputes or regulating specific economic sectors. Option (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of the relevant entities or agreements, suggesting a lack of comprehensive understanding of the interplay between legal and international trade mechanisms in economic regulation.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between domestic and international legal frameworks and their respective roles in economic governance. The inclusion of both domestic and international aspects (DRTs and WTO agreements) further increases the complexity of the question.\n\n"
