These strategies often involve shifting profits to countries with lower tax rates or exploiting loopholes in tax laws.  The statement accurately defines the core concept of BEPS.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The PPT is a key element in the BEPS initiative.  It aims to look beyond the formal structure of a transaction to assess its actual purpose. If the primary goal of a transaction is to obtain a tax advantage, the tax benefit may be denied even if the transaction complies with the letter of the law.  The statement accurately describes the function of the PPT in combating BEPS.\n"

The statement subtly reverses the key element of the definition, acting as a distractor for those with a superficial understanding of IDS.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

Statement 1 correctly states the agreement's primary objective: to curb harmful fishing subsidies that threaten the sustainability of global fish stocks.  The agreement's effectiveness, however, depends on its ratification by a sufficient number of WTO members.

The process of reaching consensus on international environmental agreements often involves balancing diverse national interests and priorities.\n\n\nStatement 2 correctly summarizes India's key demands within the context of the agreement.  India, along with other developing countries, advocates for a moratorium on distant-water fishing by developed countries to protect the fishing grounds of developing nations.  The \"polluter pays principle\" and \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" are crucial principles in international environmental law, emphasizing that those most responsible for environmental degradation should bear a greater burden in addressing it.  India's position reflects a broader concern about equitable burden-sharing in addressing the global challenge of overfishing.\n"

The complexities of balancing the interests of innovators with the needs of consumers and the public domain remain a central challenge in the application and interpretation of TRIPS.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the TRIPS Agreement aims to harmonize IPR protection to a certain extent, it does *not* mandate a completely uniform level of protection across all WTO members. The agreement allows for some flexibility to accommodate national differences and priorities.  The diverse economic and developmental contexts of WTO members necessitate a degree of differentiation in IPR policies.  The tension between harmonization and flexibility remains a key feature of the TRIPS Agreement's ongoing evolution and interpretation.

The stipulated minimum net worth, the five-year performance track record requirement, the profitability condition, and the asset quality thresholds (G-NPA and N-NPA) are all integral parts of the RBI's guidelines. These stipulations aim to ensure the financial soundness and stability of institutions making this transition.\n\nStatement 2 also correctly describes additional criteria. The requirement for stock exchange listing ensures greater transparency and accountability. The preservation of existing promoter shareholding and dilution plans reflects the RBI's focus on maintaining stability in ownership structures during the transition.  The preference for diversified loan portfolios is consistent with promoting a balanced and resilient banking model.\n\nOptions (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements correctly reflect the RBI's stipulations for SFBs aiming to become Universal Banks. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate and relevant to the transition process.\n"

The statement wrongly asserts that there will be no private sector involvement. The landlord port model is a strategic approach common in modern port development worldwide, aiming to leverage private sector efficiency and expertise.\n"

This distinction between lease/license and outright sale is fundamental to understanding AM's financial mechanisms.  The incorrect description of AM as a one-time sale completely misrepresents the core principle of generating long-term revenue.\n"

Credit rating agencies assess a nation's economic stability, including its ability to manage its external debt.  A large current account deficit signals a potential vulnerability, as it implies the country is relying heavily on foreign borrowing or capital inflows to finance its spending. This can lead to a downgrade in the country's credit rating, making it more expensive to borrow money internationally, as lenders perceive a higher risk.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While a high trade deficit does carry negative consequences such as depletion of foreign exchange reserves and potential currency depreciation, it's not universally detrimental.  There can be positive aspects.  For instance, increased imports of capital goods can boost domestic investment and long-term productivity growth.  Access to a wider range of goods can benefit consumers and increase overall welfare.  The net impact of a trade deficit depends on the underlying factors driving it and the overall economic context.  A temporary trade deficit to facilitate necessary investments might be a positive sign of future growth, while a persistent and large deficit fueled by unsustainable consumption could be damaging.\n"

Confusing the target diseases is a significant error.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Effective vaccination and robust disease surveillance are indeed cornerstones of the NADCP\u2019s strategy.  A successful disease control program necessitates widespread vaccination to achieve herd immunity and a comprehensive surveillance system to detect and promptly respond to outbreaks.  These two elements are intrinsically linked to the program's effectiveness in achieving its stated goals.\n"

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) does indeed aim to increase pulse production through area expansion and productivity improvement.  PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan) also includes oilseeds and pulses under its price support scheme, ensuring minimum support prices (MSPs).  While both schemes deal with pulses, their primary focuses differ. NFSM emphasizes production enhancement, whereas PM-AASHA primarily focuses on price support and procurement.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP), while a sub-scheme of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, is not exclusively limited to the Green Revolution states. Although it initially focused on these areas, its scope has expanded to include other regions needing crop diversification.  The statement's assertion of exclusive targeting is inaccurate.\n"

The dependence on rainfall is a major constraint to achieving consistent high yields.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The NMEO-OP aims to increase oil palm cultivation significantly, with a particular focus on the North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar Islands due to their suitability for oil palm cultivation. The initiative combines strategies like technological advancements, expansion of cultivated area and price support mechanisms to boost domestic oil production and reduce reliance on imports.

The focus was on maximizing short-term gains for the colonizer, often through forced labor, taxation, and control of trade.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  In colonies with fewer inhabitants, particularly those suitable for European settlement (like parts of North America, Australia, and New Zealand), colonial powers often adopted a different approach.  They established institutions that aimed to attract European settlers and foster economic growth within the colony. This often included creating property rights, establishing legal systems that protected investment, and encouraging the development of markets and infrastructure.  These policies aimed to create a self-sustaining economy that would benefit both the colonists and the colonizing power in the long run.

The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package) targets *harmful* fisheries subsidies\u2014those that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.  It doesn't aim to eliminate all subsidies.  Some subsidies might have positive impacts, such as those promoting sustainable fishing practices or supporting small-scale fishers. The agreement focuses on identifying and addressing the subsidies that cause the most environmental damage and undermine the sustainability of fisheries resources.  This targeted approach reflects the need to balance economic interests with environmental protection.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Geneva Package was adopted at the 12th Ministerial Conference, it wasn't unanimously approved by all member countries.  The negotiations were complex and involved significant disagreements among member states regarding the scope and implementation of the agreement.  The final agreement represents a compromise that reflects the diverse interests and priorities of WTO members.  The fact that it wasn't unanimously adopted highlights the challenges of reaching consensus on global environmental and trade issues.\n"

The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, specifically exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals listed in Part B of the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. This exclusion reflects the separate regulatory frameworks and complexities associated with the extraction of oil and gas resources compared to other minerals.  The rules focus on a specific set of offshore minerals, excluding those already covered under different legislation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The rules indeed mandate the use of a modified version of the UNFC and CRIRSCO Template for exploration stages and feasibility studies. This requirement ensures a standardized and internationally accepted approach to exploration and resource assessment.  Adopting these internationally recognized standards enhances transparency, consistency, and comparability of data related to offshore mineral resources.  It also facilitates international collaboration and investment in the sector by aligning Indian practices with global best practices.  This is crucial for ensuring the sustainable and responsible development of these valuable resources.\n"

It provided temporary protection to developing countries' PSH programs from WTO dispute settlement actions.  However, it did not resolve the underlying concerns about the trade-distorting effects of PSH, leaving the issue open for future negotiations and potential challenges.  The temporary nature of the peace clause highlights the ongoing tension and need for a lasting solution to address the concerns of both developed and developing countries.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  There's a significant divergence of views on PSH between developed and developing countries. Developing countries argue that PSH programs are essential for food security and protecting their vulnerable populations.  They advocate for higher de minimis limits (the permissible level of subsidies) to allow for larger-scale procurement and distribution of food grains.  Developed countries, on the other hand, often express concerns that PSH programs can distort markets and provide an unfair advantage to domestic producers.  They generally advocate for stricter regulations and limitations on PSH, reflecting their concerns about fair trade practices and market competitiveness.  This global divide underscores the complexities of balancing food security concerns with international trade rules.\n"

The plan encompasses a comprehensive database of ongoing and future projects from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN, demonstrating its focus on a unified and comprehensive infrastructure development strategy.  Ignoring existing assets would be a significant oversight in a plan aiming for national-scale logistical efficiency.\n"

This disagreement highlights the tension between the need for food security in developing nations and the WTO's rules aimed at promoting free and fair trade. The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi demonstrated the ongoing difficulty in finding a permanent solution to this issue.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture imposes limits on agricultural subsidies, referred to as \"de minimis\" limits. These limits define the permissible level of support a country can provide to its farmers without triggering WTO dispute settlement procedures.  The current calculation of these limits, using a reference price from 1986-88, is criticized by developing countries as outdated and inadequate.  They argue that the formula does not reflect the increased costs of agricultural production and fails to account for the specific needs of their farmers.
