PSL certificates (PSLCs) are *tradable* instruments, not non-tradable.  The tradability feature allows banks with a surplus of PSL to sell certificates to those with a shortfall, promoting efficient allocation of credit resources.

The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).\n3.

The number of crops covered and their categorization are accurately represented in the statement.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The process of determining MSPs involves a recommendation from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), followed by a final decision from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).  This two-step process ensures comprehensive consideration of various factors before MSPs are finalized.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The ambitious target set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, to achieve agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022 was not met.  While India's agricultural exports have grown, they fell short of this target.  This highlights the challenges in achieving such ambitious goals in the agricultural export sector.\n"

The IFSC Act, 2019, grants the IFSC Authority its legal basis and powers.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The IFSC Authority acts as a unified regulator, meaning it oversees all financial products, services, and institutions within Indian IFSCs.

The target amount of \u20b96.0 lakh crore is accurate.  The slight inaccuracy in the timeframe makes the statement partially incorrect, but given the other options, it's the closest to being entirely true.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant to improve project feasibility. This is a significant factual error.\n\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the IIPDF does aid in developing PPP projects, it doesn't focus solely on the renewable energy sector.  Its support extends to various infrastructure projects.  This statement misrepresents the scope of the IIPDF.\n\n\nTherefore, only statement 1 is partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer.  The other options include completely false statements.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to Indian infrastructure development initiatives, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall.

Developing countries advocate for an increase in the \"de minimis\" limit and amendments to the formula used to calculate price support subsidies for government procurement, arguing that the current system unfairly penalizes their food security programs.\n2.  Developed countries generally contend that PSH programs distort markets and should be subject to stricter limitations, even proposing the complete elimination of export restrictions related to food stockholding.\n3.

They argue that the existing \"de minimis\" limits and the formula for calculating price support subsidies are inadequate and hinder their ability to maintain essential food security programs.  They seek adjustments to allow for greater flexibility and higher levels of support.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes the stance of many developed countries. They often view PSH programs as potentially trade-distorting, advocating for stricter regulations or limitations on such programs. Their concerns center around the potential for unfair competition in global agricultural markets.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The \"Peace Clause\" was an *interim* solution, not a permanent one.  It provided temporary protection for countries' PSH programs while negotiations continued to find a lasting solution.  The issue of PSH remains a significant point of contention within the WTO.\n"

The MSP is the minimum price at which the government purchases all agricultural produce from farmers, ensuring complete market protection.\n2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends the MSP, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.\n3.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the MSP aims to prevent distress selling, it doesn't guarantee that the government will purchase *all* agricultural produce at that price. The government's procurement is often based on availability, storage capacity, and market demand. The statement oversimplifies the complexities of MSP implementation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The CACP plays a crucial advisory role in recommending MSPs, but the final authority rests with the CCEA, reflecting the political and economic considerations involved in setting these prices.  The question highlights the division of responsibilities between the advisory body and the decision-making body.\n\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The FCI is a major procuring agency, primarily for wheat and paddy, but other agencies at the state and central levels also participate in MSP procurement. The statement falsely presents the FCI as the only entity involved in procurement.\n"

Preston in 1975, demonstrates a consistent linear relationship between per capita income and life expectancy across all levels of economic development.\n2. The curve illustrates that in poor countries, initial increases in per capita income lead to significant improvements in life expectancy due to factors like improved nutrition and healthcare access.\n3.

However, it's not solely focused on economic downturns.  The World Bank's report highlights the convergence of several crises, including slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty. These crises are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, creating a more complex and challenging situation than isolated economic problems.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The World Bank's report directly states that the polycrisis has stalled global poverty reduction and widened the prosperity gap during the past five years.  This demonstrates the significant impact of interconnected crises on global development goals.  The report emphasizes the need for comprehensive and integrated strategies to address these challenges.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The prosperity gap, as defined in the World Bank's report, aims to bring everyone to a standard of $25 per person per day, not $10. This higher figure reflects a more ambitious target for global prosperity and highlights the significant income disparities that need to be addressed.  The difference between $10 and $25 is substantial, reflecting a critical detail in understanding the scale of the challenge.\n"

While NaBFID is indeed a Public Financial Institution (PFI) notified under the Companies Act, 2013, it is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's oversight is crucial given NaBFID's role in the financial system and its focus on infrastructure financing. SEBI, on the other hand, primarily regulates the securities market.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support the development of *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing.  The focus on long-term financing is critical for sustainable infrastructure development, and non-recourse financing reduces the risk for borrowers.  Short-term, high-risk financing would be counterproductive to NaBFID's goals of sustainable and responsible infrastructure development.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.

This projection reflects the anticipated growth in the sector, driven by factors such as increasing internet penetration and digital adoption.  The difference between $325 billion and $400 billion may seem small but reflects an important factual inaccuracy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  In 2022, the Indian e-commerce sector made up approximately 7% of India's total retail market, not 10%. While the sector is growing rapidly, it still constitutes a relatively smaller portion of the overall retail market compared to traditional retail channels. The difference between 7% and 10% is significant in terms of market share analysis.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  100% FDI under the automatic route is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.  This restriction aims to protect the interests of India's unorganized retail sector.  FDI is permitted in the marketplace model, where the e-commerce entity acts as a facilitator between buyers and sellers, not as an owner of inventory.  The distinction between these models is crucial for understanding FDI regulations in the Indian e-commerce sector.\n"

Exceeding this income threshold would typically place the individual outside the scope of microfinance.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) usually charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates compared to commercial banks.

While the exact proportion dedicated to expressways might vary slightly from the statement, the core objective remains the expansion of the national highway network.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The DFCs aim to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic, but the statement incorrectly suggests they aim to *surpass* the National Rail Plan 2030 target of 45% by 2030. The goal is to *reach* that target, not exceed it.  The statement also misrepresents the timeline, implying that the 27% figure is from 2019, and the 45% is the 2030 target.  The actual figures may vary slightly.  DFCCIL's role in planning and development is accurate.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While LEEP focuses on freight transport efficiency and PM GatiShakti aims for overall logistics efficiency, both initiatives are not solely focused on road infrastructure.  Both actively consider and promote multimodal transportation systems to improve efficiency and connectivity across various modes of transport.
