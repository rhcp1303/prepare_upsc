The RBI's PCA framework for UCBs aims to improve financial health with greater precision and flexibility, replacing the older Supervisory Action Framework.  The NUCFDC is indeed an umbrella organization for UCBs, functioning as an SRO and registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND (accepting public funds and having a customer interface).  The RBI's ease of expansion policy does allow certain UCBs to open new branches with reduced regulatory hurdles. Finally, the RBI's revised NPA provision norms for co-operative banks mandate the charging of provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) as an expense, aligning with Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms.

RBI buys G-securities under Open Market Operations:   Increases market liquidity, boosts consumption, and stimulates economic growth.\n2.  RBI sells G-securities under Open Market Operations:   Reduces market liquidity, decreases borrowing by businesses and individuals, potentially leading to unemployment.\n3.  Reduction in Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate: Leads to a decline in liquidity, money supply, aggregate demand, and inflation.\n4.

When the RBI buys government securities (G-secs) through Open Market Operations (OMO), it injects liquidity into the market, lowering interest rates and stimulating economic activity. Conversely, selling G-secs withdraws liquidity, increasing interest rates and potentially slowing down economic growth, leading to reduced borrowing and potentially higher unemployment.  Options 3 and 4 are incorrect because they reverse the actual effects of these policy changes. Lowering repo, reverse repo, and bank rates increases liquidity and stimulates borrowing, while raising these rates has the opposite effect.\n"

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nAll four pairs are correctly matched.  The provided details accurately reflect the challenges faced by India's steel sector.\n\n1. **Lack of Raw Material:** India's heavy reliance on imported coking coal from Australia highlights a significant vulnerability in its steel production chain. This dependence makes the sector susceptible to price fluctuations and global supply chain disruptions.  The high cost of imports directly impacts the competitiveness of Indian steel in the international market.\n\n2. **Low per capita consumption:** The stark contrast between India's per capita steel consumption and that of global leaders like China underscores the vast untapped potential within the domestic market.  This low consumption reflects factors like affordability, infrastructure development pace, and overall economic growth.  Boosting domestic consumption is crucial for the sector's expansion.\n\n3. **Carbon Emission Concerns:** The imposition of carbon taxes by the European Union presents a significant hurdle for Indian steel exports.  The steel industry is inherently energy-intensive, contributing substantially to greenhouse gas emissions.  This necessitates the adoption of cleaner production technologies and sustainable practices to maintain export competitiveness and meet global environmental standards.\n\n4. **High Logistics Costs:** Inefficient logistics infrastructure in India adds to the cost of steel production and delivery.  High transportation costs, inadequate warehousing facilities, and bureaucratic hurdles all contribute to increased prices and reduced competitiveness.  Improving logistics efficiency is essential for making Indian steel more affordable and accessible both domestically and internationally.  The lack of efficient logistics infrastructure is a major impediment to the growth of several sectors in India, including steel.\n"

Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the primary focus of the respective schemes. Pair 1 is incorrect because the National Technical Textiles Mission has a broader scope than just jute. Pair 4 is partially correct in that SITP involves park development, but it's not solely for jute modernization. The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of these schemes is crucial for analyzing India's industrial policies and their impact on the textile sector.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe provided information states that Petroleum Refinery Products have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI, followed by Electricity (19.85%).  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect (it should be 28.04%), and pair 2 is incorrect (it should be 19.85%). While the exact weights for Fertilizers and Steel aren't specified, it's mentioned that Petroleum Refinery Products and Electricity together constitute a significant portion (over 40%). This implies that the weights of other industries, including Fertilizers and Steel, would be relatively lower. Thus, pair 3 is likely correct (less than 5% is a reasonable estimate for Fertilizers given the dominance of Petroleum and Electricity), and pair 4 could be either correct or incorrect.  However, since we lack precise figures for Fertilizers and Steel, we cannot definitively confirm their matching. As none of the pairs are completely accurate based on the precise data available, the correct answer is (d).  The question highlights the importance of precise data in economic analysis and the limitations of making assumptions based on partial information.\n"

SEWA Bank, India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI), was established in 1974, not 1984. This is a crucial detail that highlights the historical significance of the institution within the Indian microfinance landscape.  The incorrect year serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's factual recall.\n\n* **Pair 2:** The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loan limit was indeed enhanced in the 2024 Union Budget. However, the increase was to \u20b920 lakh for those who had successfully repaid loans under the Tarun category, creating a \"Tarun Plus\" category, not \u20b930 lakh. This slight alteration in the figure serves as a subtle yet effective distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail and ability to differentiate between closely related figures.\n\n* **Pair 3:** The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) is correctly identified as registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, a key aspect distinguishing them from Type I NBFC-NDs.  This correct pairing underscores the candidate's understanding of the regulatory framework governing UCBs in India.\n\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched Pair 1.

        "explanation": "\n\nAll four pairs are correctly matched.  The Indian steel sector faces a multitude of challenges.  Firstly, a significant portion of its coking coal requirements are met through imports from Australia, leading to higher costs and vulnerability to global price fluctuations. This directly reflects the \"Raw Material Deficiency\" challenge. Secondly, India's per capita steel consumption is considerably lower than the global average and even more drastically lower than that of China, indicating a substantial untapped market potential but also highlighting the challenge of increasing per capita consumption. The \"Energy Intensity and Carbon Tax Impact\" pair is correct because the steel industry is a significant carbon emitter globally, and India's major iron and steel exports are threatened by the imposition of carbon taxes by the European Union. Finally, the steel industry is known for its cyclical demand patterns, meaning periods of high demand are followed by periods of low demand.  This cyclical nature makes securing sufficient capital for investment and maintaining production stability difficult, accurately reflecting the \"Cyclical Demand and Capital Needs\" challenge.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round and finalized in Marrakesh, does indeed include provisions related to market access, domestic support, and export subsidies. While it didn't explicitly introduce the \"peace clause\" initially, the Bali Ministerial Conference (MC9) in 2013 introduced a \"peace clause\" as an interim solution regarding Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security, which is related to the Agreement on Agriculture.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct in the context of its later evolution.\n\nThe WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies was a significant outcome of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) held in Geneva in 2022, aiming to curb harmful fishing subsidies.  This makes statement 2 correct.\n\nThe Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, concluded the Uruguay Round and led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Statement 3 is therefore correct.\n\nThe Nairobi Ministerial Conference (MC10) in 2015 saw the adoption of a decision on export subsidies, significantly impacting agricultural trade policies.  Therefore, statement 4 is incorrect as it describes Market Access, a feature of the Agreement on Agriculture.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe TRIPS Agreement, a cornerstone of the WTO, notably includes provisions for compulsory licensing, a mechanism that allows developing countries to produce patented products without the patent holder's consent under specific circumstances. This flexibility is crucial for public health and access to essential medicines.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a significant global initiative aimed at curbing tax avoidance by multinational corporations. A key element of this framework is the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, designed to prevent tax competition and ensure fairer tax practices. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, marked the culmination of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing GATT as the primary international body governing global trade.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, while aiming to curb harmful fishing subsidies that deplete fish stocks, does *not* include a 25-year moratorium on distant water fishing.  While the agreement seeks to reduce such practices, a specific 25-year moratorium is not a stated provision.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.\n"

NUCFDC is registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I. Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately describes NUCFDC's function.\n\n2. **PCA framework for UCBs:** The statement is incorrect. The PCA framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) is effective from April 1, 2025, not 2026.  This detail is crucial for understanding the timeline of RBI's regulatory actions concerning UCBs.\n\n3. **RBI Ombudsman (ORBIOs):** This statement is incorrect.  The RBI Ombudsman handles complaints related to various financial entities, not solely Housing Finance Companies. The scope of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction is much broader, encompassing numerous types of financial institutions and their interactions with customers.\n\n4. **SROs for REs:** This statement is incorrect.

The IBC mandates completion of CIRP within 180 days, extendable to a maximum of 330 days, not 90 days.

However, the LEADS index is not directly matched with the description. The LEADS index measures logistics performance across states within India, not global trade logistics. Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate.\n"

However, the NITI Aayog published the report on seaweed value chain development, not the Central Silk Board.  The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its platinum jubilee. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (c) is also incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of ICAR-NISA with its establishment date.

Antimicrobial resistance is a separate concern addressed through other initiatives.\n\n3. **Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying:** The department works towards improving various aspects of the livestock sector, including productivity, but it's not solely focused on productivity improvement.  This is a too broad statement to be considered a correct match.\n\nOnly the statement regarding the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying's involvement in improving cattle productivity is a reasonably accurate, albeit broad, statement.

This initiative aligns with global efforts towards decarbonization and green shipping, incentivizing ships with favorable Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores.\n\nPair 2 is incorrect. While Mumbai Port is the largest natural harbor in India, Kolkata Port (now Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port) is the only major riverine port.  The question attempts to confuse the examinee by combining characteristics of two different ports.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect. Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) in Tamil Nadu holds the distinction of being the only corporatized port registered as a company, not Vadhvan Port. Vadhvan Port is a newly developed major port. This incorrect pairing uses a similar concept (a specific type of port) as a distractor.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect.  As explained above, Kolkata Port is the only major riverine port in India, not Mumbai Port which is a natural harbor. This incorrect pairing uses a similar concept (a specific type of port) as a distractor.  The question tests the knowledge of specific port characteristics and avoids easily guessable answers.\n"

The Global MPI accurately measures deprivations across education, health, and living standards. The IHDI correctly adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities, reflecting a concern for intergenerational equity. However, the HDI was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq, not Amartya Sen.  Amartya Sen significantly contributed to the conceptual framework of human development, but the HDI's creation is specifically attributed to Mahbub ul-Haq. Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate representation of the correctly matched pairs. Option (a) is incomplete, (b) misses a correct pairing, and (d) includes an incorrect pairing.

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) indeed provide small-value, collateral-free loans primarily targeting low-income households, as defined by RBI guidelines with an annual income ceiling. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) did see its loan limit for the \"Tarun Plus\" category increased to \u20b920 lakh in the 2024 Union Budget, building upon the existing Tarun category.  The RBI serves as the regulatory authority for MFIs operating within India. SEWA Bank holds the distinction of being India's pioneering MFI, established in 1974. Finally, the Malegam Committee, commissioned by the RBI, played a crucial role in formulating a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs in 2010, addressing the need for oversight and structured guidelines within the microfinance sector.

The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, directly regulates Credit Information Companies (CICs). Pair 1 is incorrect; while the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, is a significant piece of legislation governing banking, it doesn't specifically govern the functioning of ARCs.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the treatment of wilful defaulters is not primarily dealt with in the SEBI regulations for Credit Rating Agencies. This question highlights the need for candidates to know the specific mandates of different Indian financial regulations and avoid generalizations.\n"

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a comprehensive initiative driven by seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure. It's not solely focused on road infrastructure.\n\n2. **National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):** This is incorrect. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting \u20b96.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not \u20b910 lakh crore over five years.  The timeframe and target amount are both inaccurate in this pairing.\n\n3. **Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF):**  This is incorrect.  The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant to enhance project viability.  The percentage offered is misrepresented.\n\n4. **India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF):** This is incorrect. While the IIPDF aims to support the development of PPP projects, it doesn't *primarily* support private sector projects. Its purpose is to aid the development of quality PPP projects by providing necessary funding support to the *project sponsoring authorities*, which can include both public and private entities.

This is a key initiative under the National Logistics Policy to improve the efficiency and connectivity of India's logistics infrastructure.\n\nPair 1 is incorrect. While Bharatmala Pariyojana is a significant national highway development program, its primary focus is on road infrastructure, not inland waterways. Inland waterways development is a separate initiative under the Sagarmala project.\n\nPair 2 is incorrect.  The target for increasing the share of rail freight traffic under the National Rail Plan 2030 is 45%, not 75%. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are a crucial component in achieving this target, but the target itself is lower than stated in the pair.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect. The LEADS index measures the ease of doing business in the logistics sector across different states in India. It does not specifically measure port efficiency; that would fall under different indices or metrics related to the port sector.  Port efficiency is a component of overall logistics efficiency, but LEADS doesn't isolate this aspect.\n"

It is a crucial tool for integrated planning and efficient resource allocation across various infrastructure projects.\n\nPair 1 is incorrect. NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013. While the government notified it as a Public Financial Institution under the Companies Act, 2013, that's a separate process. Its establishment itself is under a different act.\n\nPair 2 is incorrect. The RRSK is indeed a fund for upgrading railway safety infrastructure, but its focus is broader than just signaling systems. It encompasses a wide range of safety improvements, including track renewal, bridge strengthening, and other critical infrastructure upgrades.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect. Vadhvan Port is planned as a major container port and a large deep-water port, not a dry port. Dry ports are inland terminals connected to seaports via rail or road.\n"

ADeX is a data exchange platform for farmers, encompassing farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown data.  It's not primarily focused on livestock; livestock data would be handled through separate databases and initiatives.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect.  The MSP covers a wider range of crops beyond just Kharif crops. It includes both Kharif and Rabi crops, as well as some commercial crops.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect.

While Sagarmala does include some inland waterway development, its primary focus is on optimizing and modernizing the overall port infrastructure and logistics along India's coastline, including port modernization, connectivity improvements, and logistics efficiency.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect.  The LPAI manages both land customs stations and immigration check posts at integrated check posts (ICPs) along India's land borders.

The Agreement on Agriculture, a crucial part of the WTO framework, deals with various aspects of agricultural trade policies, including market access (tariffication, tariff reductions), domestic support (subsidies), and export subsidies.  The public stockholding (PSH) programs, used by many developing countries to procure and distribute food grains at minimum support prices (MSP), have been a point of contention within the WTO due to their potential to distort markets.  The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture acknowledges the need for food security but imposes de minimis limits on subsidies to prevent market distortion, with different thresholds for developed and developing countries.

The National Fisheries Development Program Portal is a platform created to support the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY, and thus doesn't directly relate to providing multilingual information on fish species. Option (d) correctly identifies the two pairs (2 and 4) with accurate matches.  Option (a) is incorrect because PMMSY's focus is broader than just ornamental fish. Option (b) is incorrect as the Rangeen Machhli app's function is mismatched. Option (c) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched in this option.\n"
