    "correct_option": "(d)",
    "explanation": "\n\nOption (d) correctly describes the key aspects of the RBI's surplus transfer mechanism.  The Bimal Jalan Committee's Economic Capital Framework (ECF) is central to this process. The ECF establishes thresholds for both realized equity (5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet) and economic capital (CGRA, 20.8% to 25.4% of the balance sheet). If the RBI's holdings exceed these prescribed ranges, the excess is transferred to the central government.  This framework ensures the RBI maintains adequate capital reserves while contributing to the government's finances. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.  The RBI consistently generates a surplus, not a deficit, due to its net interest income significantly outpacing its expenses.  Section 47 of the RBI Act mandates transferring *profits*, not losses, to the Centre.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations led to *increased*, not decreased, surplus transfers.\n"

They are agreements between the tax authority (CBDT) and a taxpayer to determine the arm's length price (ALP) of transactions beforehand, minimizing future disputes.  Option (a) is incorrect because APAs don't deal with domestic transactions; their focus is on cross-border transactions. Option (b) is also incorrect, as APAs are not involved in settling GST-related disputes. They are an instrument for resolving transfer pricing disputes under the Income Tax Act, not indirect tax laws.

The question highlights its overarching goal and mentions its association with key supporting schemes like the PLI scheme for textiles and the PM MITRA Scheme. These schemes are integral components of the Mission's strategy to boost domestic production and competitiveness in the technical textiles sector. Option (a), SITP, while related to the textile industry, doesn't have the same overarching ambition. Option (b), the Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme, focuses on modernization and technology upgrades within the broader textile industry, not specifically technical textiles. Finally, Option (d), VisioNxt, is a fashion forecasting initiative, unrelated to the stated objective.  The National Technical Textiles Mission's comprehensive approach, encompassing various supportive schemes, makes it the most accurate answer.\n"

    "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because the question directly describes the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index).  The FI-Index is a comprehensive measure created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to assess the level of financial inclusion across India. It considers various aspects of financial access, usage, and quality across different sectors, including banking, investments, insurance, postal services, and pensions. The index is represented by a single numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies complete financial exclusion, and 100 represents full financial inclusion. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The RBI's Financial Stability Report focuses on the overall health of the financial system, not specifically on financial inclusion.  The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a government initiative aimed at promoting financial inclusion, but it's not an index itself.

    "explanation": " The Narasimham Committee \u2013 II (1998) played a crucial role in shaping the Indian financial landscape by recommending the establishment of ARCs.  This committee, tasked with reviewing the financial sector reforms, recognized the need for specialized institutions to address the growing problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the banking system.  The committee proposed a model for ARCs, drawing on the experience of similar asset management companies in other countries.  The subsequent enactment of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act), laid the legal groundwork for the establishment and operation of ARCs in India. The other committees mentioned focused on different aspects of the Indian legal and financial system, such as criminal justice reform (Malimath Committee) or inter-governmental relations (Sarkaria Committee).  The Verma Committee's work, while significant, did not directly address the creation of ARCs.  The Narasimham Committee's recommendation thus holds a pivotal position in the genesis of ARCs in India.\n"

This act empowers ARCs to acquire NPAs from banks and financial institutions, thereby helping banks clean up their balance sheets and focus on their core lending functions. The other acts listed deal with different aspects of the Indian legal and financial system. The Competition Act, 2002, focuses on competition policy; the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, primarily regulates banks; and the Companies Act, 2013, governs the incorporation and operations of companies.  Therefore, the SARFAESI Act is the specific legislation under which ARCs are registered and regulated, reflecting its targeted approach towards resolving the issue of stressed assets in the Indian financial sector.

A longer period could lead to increased costs and complexities, while a shorter period might not be sufficient to address the complexities involved in asset resolution.  The 8-year limit strikes a balance between the need for timely resolution and the practicalities involved in asset recovery and management.

Option (a) describes Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), not MAP. Option (b) is too broad; while MAP *can* involve individual income, its focus is on the treaty's provisions, not solely individuals. Option (d) is a separate goal in international tax policy, not the direct function of MAP.  Understanding the distinction between MAP (dispute resolution) and APAs (dispute prevention) is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of international tax mechanisms.\n"

The NFSM focuses on production enhancement, the CDP on diversification, and KISAN on crop insurance and yield estimation; none directly address price volatility in the same way as PM-AASHA.  Therefore, PM-AASHA is the most appropriate answer.  Understanding the nuances of each scheme is crucial for accurately answering this question.\n"

    "explanation": "\n\nThe cobweb phenomenon arises from the time lag between farmers' planting decisions (based on current prices) and the subsequent harvest, when the market price may have changed. If the price is high, farmers plant more, leading to a surplus and lower prices in the next period. Conversely, low prices lead to reduced planting, resulting in shortages and higher prices later. This creates a cyclical pattern. While climate change and procurement delays can impact prices, they don't directly explain the inherent cyclical nature of the cobweb phenomenon as well as the time lag between production and market response. The Agricultural Export Policy has a broader impact but doesn't specifically cause this cyclical fluctuation.\n"

While a Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) involves setting aside profits, its purpose is to pay dividends in future years, not to cover potential losses.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) is a framework to address the financial health of banks, not a specific accounting practice.

The agreement significantly broadened the scope of international trade rules to encompass services, intellectual property rights, and investment, creating a more comprehensive and modern multilateral trading system.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they refer to different phases or events in the history of international trade negotiations. The Tokyo Round predates the Marrakesh Agreement, while the Doha Development Round followed it.  GATT existed before the WTO, being superseded by the latter.  Therefore, the establishment of the WTO, a direct consequence of the Marrakesh Agreement, makes (a) the only accurate answer.\n"

    "explanation": "\n\nPublic Stockholding (PSH) schemes, where governments procure agricultural produce at Minimum Support Prices (MSP), store them, and distribute them to the needy, have been a major point of contention within the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture. Developed countries argue that PSH schemes distort markets and violate existing subsidy limits. Developing countries, however, contend that these schemes are crucial for food security and poverty alleviation, requiring higher de minimis limits and adjustments to the calculation of price support subsidies.  While MSPs are related, they are not the direct focus of WTO debate in the same way as PSH. Agricultural export subsidies and tariffs/non-tariff barriers are also addressed by the Agreement on Agriculture, but the ongoing discussion specifically focuses on the implications of PSH for global trade and its compatibility with WTO rules.  Therefore, the persistent disagreement surrounding the compatibility of PSH with WTO rules makes it the most accurate answer.\n"

    "option_a": "The National Infrastructure Pipeline\n",
    "option_b": "The Bharatmala Pariyojana\n",
    "option_c": "The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan\n",
    "option_d": "The Sagarmala Project\n\n\n",
    "correct_option": "(c)",
    "explanation": "\n\nThe PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is the correct answer.  The question highlights key features: its 2021 launch date, its use of a digital master planning tool based on open-source technology, and the integration of satellite imagery. These details uniquely identify the PM GatiShakti initiative. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all significant infrastructure development programs in India, but they do not possess the specific characteristics described in the question.  The National Infrastructure Pipeline is a broader plan outlining infrastructure projects, Bharatmala focuses on road development, and Sagarmala focuses on port-led development. None of these utilize the described digital master planning tool with the specified technological features.  The PM GatiShakti plan's integrated approach, leveraging technology for efficient planning and coordination across various ministries, distinguishes it from the others. This integrated approach is crucial for efficient infrastructure development and aligns with current government priorities for holistic infrastructure development.\n"

    "question_text": "The regulatory body responsible for overseeing the functioning of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India and which recently saw a significant milestone with the 50th anniversary of India's first MFI is:**\n",
    "option_a": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n",
    "option_b": "The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)\n",
    "option_c": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\n",
    "option_d": "The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NABFID)\n\n\n",
    "correct_option": "(c)",
    "explanation": "\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the correct answer. The question points to the regulatory oversight of MFIs and the 50th anniversary of SEWA Bank, India's first MFI.  The RBI's role in regulating MFIs is well-established, stemming from its broader mandate in overseeing the financial sector. SEBI, IRDAI, and NABFID have different regulatory domains: SEBI regulates securities markets, IRDAI regulates insurance, and NABFID focuses on infrastructure financing.  The inclusion of the 50th-anniversary detail further strengthens the link to the RBI, which has played a crucial role in the evolution of the microfinance sector in India, including the regulatory framework governing MFIs and the growth of the sector since the establishment of SEWA Bank.  The RBI's Malegam Committee report further highlights its involvement in shaping the regulatory landscape for MFIs.\n"

    "option_a": "Focus on Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability.\n",
    "option_b": "Implementation effective from April 1, 2025.\n",
    "option_c": "Application to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions.\n",
    "option_d": "Mandating the immediate nationalization of financially unsound UCBs.\n\n\n",
    "correct_option": "(d)",
    "explanation": "\n\nOption (d) is the correct answer because the PCA framework does not mandate immediate nationalization. While the PCA framework aims to address the financial health of UCBs, it employs a tiered approach with corrective actions depending on the severity of the issue.  Immediate nationalization is not a standard procedure under the PCA framework. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all accurate descriptions of the PCA framework. The focus on Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability is central to the framework's design. The implementation date and the exclusion of UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions are also correctly stated. The PCA framework is designed to provide a more nuanced and flexible approach to addressing financial health issues in UCBs than simply resorting to immediate nationalization. This approach recognizes the need for a balance between regulatory intervention and preserving the autonomy of UCBs wherever possible.\n"

    "correct_option": "(c)",
    "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) \u20b96.0 lakh crore. The question directly asks for the target amount of the NMP.  The other options are plausible distractors, but the stated target of \u20b96.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) is the accurate figure mentioned.  This initiative reflects the government's strategy to leverage existing assets for generating investment and boosting infrastructure development. The NMP's focus on asset monetization is a significant policy shift that has implications for public finance management and the role of the private sector in infrastructure development.  The success of the NMP will depend on several factors, including attracting private investment, ensuring transparent processes, and balancing the goals of revenue generation with the preservation of public assets.\n"

The question describes the organization's functions (liquidity support, regulatory compliance, technology platform) and its registration as a Type II NBFC-ND with the RBI.  These characteristics pinpoint the NUCFDC. The other options are involved in the cooperative or financial sectors, but they do not match the specific description in the question. The NCDC focuses on cooperative development, NABARD on rural development, and SIDBI on small industries. The NUCFDC's role in providing a cohesive framework for UCBs is a significant step in strengthening the urban cooperative banking sector in India.  The creation of this umbrella organization underscores the government's focus on strengthening the regulatory and operational capabilities of UCBs.\n\n"
