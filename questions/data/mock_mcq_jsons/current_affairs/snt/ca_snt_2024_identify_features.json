While rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are all components found in lunar regolith,  agglutinates are unique to the Moon. Agglutinates are formed by the welding together of fine-grained soil particles by impact events.  The high-energy impacts melt the surface material, which then cools and glues the particles together. This process is unique to the Moon's environment due to the lack of atmosphere and significant bombardment by meteoroids.  Therefore, only agglutinates are a peculiar component only found on the Moon, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly suggest that multiple components are unique to the lunar surface.\n"

The separation of the lander from the propulsion module and its subsequent descent necessitates precise navigation and control over a considerable distance.  The extremely high initial velocity requires a complex system of retro-rockets and thrusters to decelerate the lander to zero velocity safely, particularly given the lack of atmospheric drag. Lunar dust is a known hazard, potentially obscuring cameras and other sensors, leading to incorrect readings.  Sunlight's abundance is not a challenge; in fact,  the lack of sunlight during the lunar night presents a more significant challenge to the mission's survival.

Nuclear fusion is a process where two lighter atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen) fuse together under immense pressure and heat to form a heavier nucleus (like helium), releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. This fusion reaction occurs in a state of matter known as plasma\u2014an extremely hot, ionized gas consisting of positively charged ions and free-moving electrons.  The fusion process faces a significant hurdle: the Coulomb Barrier, which is the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.  Overcoming this barrier requires supplying massive amounts of energy. Currently, the energy required to initiate and sustain controlled nuclear fusion reactions in experimental settings exceeds the energy generated by the fusion process itself.  Significant advancements are needed to achieve net energy gain, making the process commercially viable for electricity generation.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, indeed mandate licenses for drug formulations containing a single active ingredient, explicitly mentioned by its proper (generic) name.  This promotes transparency and avoids confusion stemming from multiple brand names for the same drug.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but requires nuance. While the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) plays a significant role in promoting generic medicine usage, the rules themselves don't directly grant pharmacies this specific power.  The DTAB's recommendations influence the practice, but the legal framework is more complex.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While prescriptions are essential for many drugs, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules don't entirely prohibit the sale of drugs without prescriptions in all cases.  Over-the-counter medications and certain other categories may not require prescriptions.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The Rules encompass a comprehensive framework for the approval and registration of new drugs, ensuring quality control and safety standards are met before they enter the market.  This involves stringent testing and documentation processes.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the core principles of the 1945 Rules regarding licensing and drug registration.  Statement 2 is partially true due to DTAB's influence, and statement 3 is entirely false.\n"

While biosimilars undergo rigorous regulatory scrutiny, the process is not identical to that of completely novel biological drugs.  The regulatory pathways might differ slightly, recognizing that a biosimilar's similarity to an already approved drug reduces the need for extensive testing in certain areas.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Biosimilars are developed after the original biological medicine's patent has expired, allowing other manufacturers to produce and sell similar versions.  This promotes competition and reduces drug prices.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 4 are entirely accurate.

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nWeb 3.0 is characterized by its decentralized nature, aiming to eliminate the reliance on central authorities and intermediaries that dominate Web 2.0.  Peer-to-peer transactions, facilitated by blockchain technology, are a core feature, allowing direct interactions between users without needing intermediaries like banks or payment processors.  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are self-governing entities operating on blockchain, representing a shift away from centralized corporate control.  Enhanced data security is a key benefit, as user data is often distributed and encrypted across the network, making it more resistant to breaches compared to centralized systems in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Blockchain-based social networks are also emerging, offering users more control over their data and interactions. Option (a) accurately reflects these characteristics. Option (b) is incorrect because Web 3.0 explicitly aims to reduce reliance on intermediaries. Option (c) is partially correct in highlighting enhanced security, but it omits the other crucial aspects. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of the reliance on intermediaries, which is a feature of Web 2.0, not Web 3.0.\n"

The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, indeed mandate licensing for single-active-ingredient formulations using only the proper name, promoting generic prescribing.  This is a crucial aspect of the regulatory framework aiming to streamline the process and make generic medications more accessible.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The DTAB's role in allowing pharmacies to dispense generic equivalents, even with branded prescriptions, reflects a policy to encourage the use of cost-effective generic alternatives while respecting patient choice, as communicated through the prescription.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct but misleading in its wording. The Indian Medical Council regulations strongly encourage generic prescribing, but the wording \"strongly encourage, but don't mandate\" makes it less impactful than it actually is.  While not a strict legal mandate with explicit penalties, the ethical guidelines carry significant weight and influence prescribing practices. The statement subtly downplays the importance of the ethical guidelines.\n\nStatement 4 is also partially correct. The National Medical Commission Act does empower State Medical Councils to take disciplinary action, but the lack of specific penalties mentioned in the statement creates a sense of uncertainty.  While the ability to take action exists, the statement's vagueness is a distractor. The actual disciplinary actions can vary significantly depending on the council and the context.\n\nTherefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) accurately reflect aspects of the regulatory landscape, although statements 3 and 4 contain subtle nuances that make them less precise than they could be.\n"
