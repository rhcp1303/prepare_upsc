The other options are all valid challenges:  uneven terrain complicates navigation and altitude control; the distance between the lander and propulsion module adds complexity to the separation and descent process; and lunar dust can interfere with sensors and imaging systems. The absence of an atmosphere to slow the descent is a key difference between landing on the Moon and landing on planets with atmospheres like Mars.

Over vast periods, this gravitational interaction has synchronized the Moon's rotation period with its orbital period around the Earth, resulting in only one side of the Moon being perpetually visible from Earth.  The other options are incorrect. While the Earth's magnetic field and solar wind do influence the Moon, they are not the primary drivers of tidal locking. Similarly, the Moon's internal geological activity plays a minor role compared to the dominant effect of Earth's gravity. Understanding tidal locking is crucial for mission planning, as it dictates the availability of sunlight and influences the design of solar-powered lunar missions. The implications of tidal locking extend to the thermal conditions on the lunar surface, necessitating careful consideration of mission durations and operational strategies during lunar nights.\n"

This is characteristic of Carbon-14 dating. Options (a) and (b) are used for dating much older geological materials. Option (d) is a newer technique still under development. Carbon-14 dating is a widely used and well-established technique for dating organic remains. The method is based on the constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere during the lifetime of an organism.  After death, the carbon-14 decays at a known rate, allowing scientists to estimate the time elapsed since the organism died. The half-life of carbon-14 (approximately 5,700 years) limits the applicability of this method to relatively recent materials.  The development of newer techniques like Calcium-41 dating may eventually extend the range of radiometric dating.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nWhile iron fortification addresses widespread iron deficiency, it presents a potential risk of iron overload for individuals already suffering from conditions like thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.  These conditions involve an existing excess of iron in the body, and further iron intake can exacerbate health problems.  Therefore, the primary concern is the potential for adverse effects in individuals with pre-existing iron imbalances.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are less significant concerns compared to the risk of iron overload in vulnerable populations.\n"

However, assembling complex genomes with repetitive sequences becomes challenging due to the difficulty in accurately ordering these small fragments. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, generates longer sequences, making it easier to assemble genomes with repetitive regions.  Therefore, option (a) is correct as short-read sequencing is less effective for complex, repetitive genomes. Option (b) is incorrect; long-read does not break the genome into smaller fragments *before* sequencing, but it does fragment and tag the DNA to track fragments.

This is achieved by incorporating genetic material encoding for a gene, Cas9 enzyme (acting as molecular scissors), and CRISPR (repetitive DNA sequences) into an organism's DNA.  The Cas9 enzyme, guided by CRISPR, cuts the DNA at a specific location, allowing the desired gene to be inserted or modified, increasing its inheritance likelihood.

The magnetic field lines are forced to circulate around the superconductor, creating a sort of magnetic shielding effect. Option (b) correctly describes the Meissner effect. Option (a) is incorrect; superconductors have zero resistance. Option (c) describes the opposite phenomenon. Option (d) describes Cooper pair formation which is a mechanism behind superconductivity. The Meissner effect has significant implications for various applications of superconductors, such as magnetic levitation and sensitive magnetic field measurements.\n\n"

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  Option (b) ignores the energy input required. Option (c) refers to conversion efficiency, not the fundamental criterion of NEG. Option (d) focuses on the environmental benefits, not the core definition of NEG. The achievement of NEG represents a major breakthrough in fusion energy research, potentially opening the door to a clean, safe, and abundant energy source.  The significance lies in the transition from experimental fusion reactions to self-sustaining and commercially viable power generation.\n"

This contrasts with the broader scope of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which provides the overarching legal framework. The NLEM 2022 focuses on pricing and essential medicines, and the Indian Medical Council regulations deal with physician conduct, not drug licensing directly.  The specificity of the licensing requirement for single-ingredient formulations points directly to the detailed regulations within the 1945 rules.\n"

The primary advantage of placing a solar observatory at L1 is the continuous, uninterrupted view of the Sun, without any eclipses or obstructions from the Earth. While L1 offers some gravitational stability, reducing fuel requirements for maintaining the spacecraft\u2019s position, the continuous view of the Sun is the defining benefit for solar observation missions.  L1 does not inherently offer superior protection from solar radiation compared to other locations."

        "explanation": "  Fusion reactions require extreme temperatures and pressures to overcome the Coulomb barrier repelling the positively charged atomic nuclei.  Containing and controlling this plasma at these conditions is technologically extremely challenging.   Fusion fuels, primarily isotopes of hydrogen, are abundant. Fusion does not produce the same level of long-lived radioactive waste as fission. And, in fact, fusion reactions release far more energy than fission reactions per unit mass of fuel."

Nutation is a small, periodic variation in the Earth's axis of rotation. Orbital resonance describes a situation where two or more orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other.  Tidal locking is a direct consequence of the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon, resulting in the observed synchronization of the Moon's rotation and orbital motion.

Unlike subtractive manufacturing, which removes material to create a shape, 3D printing adds material, allowing for the creation of complex geometries and intricate designs that are difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional methods. This process offers several advantages, including reduced material waste, faster prototyping, and the ability to produce customized products on demand. The other options, subtractive manufacturing, injection molding, and CNC machining, are all subtractive manufacturing processes that involve removing material from a larger block to create the desired shape.
