It's not suitable for dating objects much older than approximately 50,000 years because the amount of remaining carbon-14 becomes too small to accurately measure.  Beyond this limit, other radiometric dating methods, such as those using longer-lived isotopes like Potassium-40 or Uranium, are employed.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Calcium-41 is indeed a rare, long-lived radioisotope of calcium with a half-life significantly longer than carbon-14. Its lower abundance compared to carbon-14 makes it less commonly used in radiometric dating, although recent research suggests its potential in this field using Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA).\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  While Calcium-41 is a rare, long-lived radioisotope found in the Earth's crust and produced by cosmic ray interactions, its half-life is significantly longer than 10,000 years; it's approximately 99,400 years. This difference in half-life significantly affects its application in dating.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a highly sensitive technique used in radiometric dating, capable of measuring extremely low concentrations of Calcium-41. This allows for the dating of materials older than the typical range of Carbon-14 dating (approximately 50,000 years).\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Calcium-41 is less frequently found than Carbon-14. The relative scarcity of Calcium-41 necessitates the use of highly sensitive techniques like ATTA for its detection and analysis in radiometric dating.\n"

Member nations are not legally obligated to adhere to them.  The statement misrepresents the voluntary nature of Codex standards.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The WTO's SPS Agreement explicitly recognizes Codex standards as a benchmark for international food safety regulations.  While not legally binding in themselves, Codex standards carry significant weight in resolving trade disputes related to food safety and sanitary measures.  The statement incorrectly claims that the SPS Agreement ignores Codex standards.\n"

SDNs are enzymes that cut DNA at specific locations, allowing for precise insertions, deletions, or replacements of genetic material.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  SDN1 and SDN2 methods, unlike SDN3, do not introduce foreign genetic material.  The alterations made are within the organism's existing genetic code, making the final product genetically similar to conventionally bred organisms. This is a crucial distinction from methods involving transgenes.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  This statement reverses the roles of GMOs and genome editing. GMOs, by definition, involve the introduction of foreign genes (transgenes) into an organism's genome, whereas genome editing techniques, like CRISPR-Cas9, modify the existing genetic material without necessarily introducing foreign DNA.  Genome editing can be used to create GMOs, but it's not limited to that; it can also be used to make precise changes without adding foreign genetic material.  The key difference lies in the source of the genetic material being modified.\n"

SDNs are enzymes that cut DNA at specific locations, allowing for precise modifications.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The three SDN categories (SDN-1, SDN-2, and SDN-3) differentiate based on the source of the genetic material.  SDN-1 and SDN-2 utilize only the organism's existing genetic material, while SDN-3 introduces genetic material from an external source. This distinction is crucial in understanding the potential implications of different gene editing approaches.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Gene editing techniques like CRISPR are distinct from the creation of GMOs. While GMOs involve introducing foreign genes, gene editing primarily focuses on modifying existing genes within an organism's genome.  The changes made through gene editing are often subtle and precise alterations, not the introduction of entire genes from different species.  The result of gene editing might be indistinguishable from naturally occurring variations.\n"

Nuclear fusion involves the combination of two *light* atomic nuclei (not heavy) to form a single heavier nucleus, releasing vast amounts of energy.  This process is the energy source of stars, including our Sun.  Statement 2 is correct. The Coulomb Barrier is a significant hurdle in achieving controlled nuclear fusion.  The positive charges of the nuclei repel each other strongly, requiring substantial energy input to overcome this repulsion and bring the nuclei close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and initiate fusion. Statement 3 is also correct.  Currently, achieving net energy gain in fusion reactions remains a major challenge.  More energy is needed to initiate the fusion process than is currently produced by the fusion reaction itself.  This is a key obstacle that the ITER project aims to overcome.

In fact, the Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India (DTAB) actively supports the sale of generic versions even when branded versions are prescribed. This is to promote affordability and access to essential medicines.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, cover general quality control, they don't have specific provisions solely dedicated to biosimilars.  The regulation of biosimilars involves a more nuanced and complex regulatory framework, often handled by specialized bodies within the CDSCO.  The rules provide a broader framework for drug safety and quality but lack the specific detail needed for biosimilars.\n"
