Chandrayaan-2 significantly expanded on Chandrayaan-1's objectives, aiming for a soft landing and achieving further observations related to water signatures and the distribution of minor elements like chromium and manganese.  While it detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately, this was more significantly a finding of Chandrayaan-1. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a successful soft landing on the Moon's South Pole, a significant feat, but the specific detection of  hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately is primarily attributed to earlier missions. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

The NOTP, an initiative under NOTTO, establishes and maintains a national registry of organ and tissue donation and transplantation.

        "explanation": "\n\nMaternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are techniques used in Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), also known as three-parent baby procedures.  These methods involve replacing a mother's diseased mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor to prevent mitochondrial diseases from being passed on to offspring.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) uses replacement enzymes, not these specific reproductive techniques. Long-read genome sequencing helps in understanding genomes, but it's not directly involved in creating synthetic human embryos.  The creation of synthetic embryos utilizes stem cell technology.  Only the pairing of Pronuclear Transfer with its correct application is accurate.  A comprehensive understanding of assisted reproductive technologies and their applications is crucial for evaluating ethical and scientific considerations in reproductive medicine.\n"

Web 2.0, not Web 3.0, is characterized by its centralized nature and heavy reliance on intermediaries such as social media platforms and search engines.  Web 3.0, in contrast, aims to decentralize the web, enabling peer-to-peer transactions and interactions without intermediaries.

Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus originating from fruit bats, capable of spreading through contaminated food or direct human-to-human transmission. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) is a subtype of the influenza A virus, primarily affecting birds but with rare human infections.  Finally, Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms and transmitted via mosquitoes.  Since all pairs are correctly matched, option (d) is the correct answer.

Lagrange points are indeed locations where the gravitational forces of two celestial bodies cancel out. Gravitational lensing correctly describes the bending of light around massive objects, leading to magnification. The event horizon defines the boundary of a black hole, beyond which escape is impossible.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.\n"

Additive manufacturing is indeed the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, which involves removing material to create a shape. Subtractive manufacturing does not involve laying down successive material layers; that's the core principle of additive manufacturing.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is indeed a cloud-based software delivery model where the cloud provider develops and maintains the application software.  The other pairs are incorrect. Web 3.0, in contrast to the statement, is designed to minimize reliance on intermediaries. Blockchain technology is fundamentally a decentralized and distributed ledger technology, not centralized. While Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies do utilize algorithms for validation, the description of the algorithm's function is overly simplified and doesn't capture its core purpose of securing the blockchain.  Finally, NFTs are explicitly *non-fungible*, meaning they are unique and cannot be exchanged for one another without a change in value;  the description of them as fungible is completely wrong.

Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is indeed presented as a cost-effective approach.  CAD is correctly identified as the digital model used in 3D printing.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  Additive manufacturing is the *opposite* of subtractive manufacturing\u2014it adds material layer by layer, not removes it.\n"
