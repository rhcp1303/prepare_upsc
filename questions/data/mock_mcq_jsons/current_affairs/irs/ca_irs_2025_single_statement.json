Reduced tensions lower the risk associated with trade and investment, encouraging greater economic exchange.  While options (a), (c), and (d) might be indirectly influenced by improved relations, they are not immediate or direct consequences of the troop disengagement agreement. Military expenditure reduction is a complex decision with multiple factors and not solely dependent on this agreement. Infrastructure project costs are also affected by many variables beyond improved relations.

Option (b) is incorrect; a high GCI ranking reflects strong commitments, but does not guarantee the absence of all vulnerabilities. Option (d) is incorrect as the MER assessment is a continuous process, and the complete elimination of such crimes is an ongoing goal.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",

Its location on the Gulf of Oman provides India with a crucial alternative route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing the need to transit through Pakistan.  This is of immense importance for India's regional connectivity and strategic interests. The port's alignment with the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) further underscores its role in facilitating trade and connectivity with landlocked countries in Central Asia and beyond. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. Chabahar's primary strategic value doesn't lie in connecting India to East Africa or South America, nor does it primarily serve the Southeast Asian trade route.  While it can contribute to trade with these regions indirectly, its core strategic importance is related to its access to Afghanistan and Central Asia, offering an alternative to traditional routes.\n"

Option (b) is incorrect as India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2022. While updated assessments occur, the initial adoption date remains 2010.

        "explanation": " The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), signed in 2009, aims to liberalize trade between ASEAN member states and India. The mention of a recent joint committee meeting and a trade deficit (imbalance) clearly points to AITIGA.  The SAARC Currency Swap Framework is a financial agreement, not a trade agreement. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's Supply Chain Agreement focuses on supply chain resilience, not broad trade liberalization. IMEC is a relatively new initiative focusing on connectivity, not on a pre-existing trade agreement.  For UPSC preparation, understanding AITIGA's impact on India's trade relations with ASEAN is important for demonstrating knowledge of India's economic diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region.\n"

MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that bind to messenger RNA (mRNA), silencing the mRNA and thus regulating protein production. This post-transcriptional gene regulation is a critical aspect of how organisms develop and function.  Option (a) is incorrect as their work doesn't involve a novel enzyme. Option (b) is incorrect as their research isn't directly focused on cancer therapy, although the implications of their discovery are relevant to various diseases. Option (c) is incorrect because their contribution isn't directly related to gene editing techniques. Their work revealed a naturally occurring regulatory mechanism, not a new technology for gene manipulation.

Nepal claims the Kali River originates west of Kalapani, justifying their claim to the territory. India, however, argues that the river's source lies further south, placing the boundary elsewhere.  Option (a) is incorrect as the McMahon Line is relevant to the India-China border. Option (b) is a related but secondary aspect; the Lipulekh Pass's location is a consequence of the broader river dispute. Option (d) is a misleading simplification; the dispute's core is geopolitical, not primarily economic.  Understanding the historical treaty interpretation and the geographical significance of the Kali River's source is crucial for grasping the complexities of this long-standing issue.
