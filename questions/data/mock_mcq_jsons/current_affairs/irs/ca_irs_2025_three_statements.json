While the exact details of the project's implementation are still evolving, its core objective is to bolster trade and economic relations through improved connectivity. Statement 1 is largely correct; though IMEC likely incorporates various modes of transport, maritime routes are anticipated to be a significant component.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the strategic implications of IMEC for India's broader economic strategy.  Diversifying trade routes and reducing dependence on traditional channels is a key goal of the initiative. Statement 3, however, is incorrect.  Such large-scale infrastructure projects often necessitate international collaboration and funding from various sources, including multilateral development banks and private sector investment. The Indian government's role is significant, but it's unlikely to be the sole funder.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude or misrepresent key aspects of the IMEC project.\n"

The  year 2000 is significant for India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, a separate piece of legislation.  The timeline is crucial for accurate understanding of India's participation in international efforts against financial crimes.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a vital role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.  Its collaboration with the ED (established in 1956) strengthens India's enforcement capabilities.  This statement accurately reflects the institutional framework.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The PMLA was enacted in 2002, not 1992.

The inaccuracy in the year of PMLA's enactment and the imprecise description of UAPA's role make this statement flawed.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.\n"

It's a line of control based on differing perceptions and claims by both sides, leading to frequent disputes and misunderstandings.  The lack of a formally agreed-upon border is a significant source of tension.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Galwan clash of 2020 marked a significant escalation in border tensions and resulted in casualties on both sides, making it the deadliest incident since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. This event significantly impacted the bilateral relationship.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  China's claim over Arunachal Pradesh as part of its Tibet Autonomous Region is a long-standing point of contention in the India-China border dispute. This territorial claim significantly complicates the border issue in the Eastern Sector.\n"

India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, utilizing a standardized methodology across all evaluated nations.\n3.

While the MER does assess measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's inaccurate to state that cybersecurity threats are explicitly excluded.

The PMLA, 2002, and UAPA, 1967, are crucial in India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. However, the statement's claim that they *don't* address the financing of organized crime is false.  While not their sole focus, both acts have provisions that indirectly or directly impact the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes linked to organized criminal activities.  The overlap between terrorist financing and organized crime is significant, making it difficult to completely separate these legal frameworks from the broader issue of organized crime financing.\n"

India and Bhutan have a long history of energy cooperation, with joint ventures involving the development of several hydropower projects, including Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu, but  these projects are primarily for Bhutan's domestic consumption and provide minimal export to India.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

Many large lakes are freshwater, but Turkana's high salinity and alkalinity are defining characteristics.  The largest freshwater lake by volume is Lake Superior.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Omo River, originating in *Ethiopia*, not Kenya, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana. This is a crucial geographical detail often overlooked. The river's flow significantly impacts the lake's ecosystem and water levels.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  A recent survey, conducted after a 50-year gap, actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana. This highlights the importance of periodic ecological assessments and the potential for sustainable resource management in challenging environments.  The findings suggest that the lake's ecosystem is more resilient than previously thought.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The LAC in the Western Sector (Ladakh) is highly disputed.  India considers the Johnson Line (1865) as its boundary, while China claims the McDonald Line (1899) and also bases its claims on the Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line.  There is no mutually agreed-upon LAC in this sector.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While the McMahon Line was indeed drawn during the Simla Convention of 1914, China does not recognize it as a legitimate border. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region.  The LAC in the Eastern Sector is therefore heavily disputed.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Galwan Valley clash of 2020 was a major escalation of the border dispute between India and China, resulting in significant casualties and marking the deadliest confrontation since the 1962 war.  This event significantly impacted the bilateral relationship.\n"

It's a comprehensive assessment of a country's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.  The statement wrongly limits the scope of the MER.\n\nStatement 2 is partially incorrect. While India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010 and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, the statement implies a mandatory on-site visit which is not always the case. The methodology can vary depending on the country's risk profile and cooperation. The process is a combination of desk reviews, documentation analysis, and potentially on-site visits.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The PMLA, 2002, the FIU-IND (established in 2004), and the MLAT Portal (launched in 2022) are all key components of India's efforts to combat money laundering.  These represent legislative frameworks, institutional mechanisms, and initiatives for international cooperation.  Therefore, this statement accurately reflects India's anti-money laundering measures.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is accurate. Australia's 2024 National Defence Strategy explicitly identifies India as a \u2018top-tier security partner\u2019 in the Indo-Pacific, reflecting a strategic shift towards closer security cooperation. This underscores the growing importance of the India-Australia partnership in maintaining regional stability.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the 2022 ECTA aimed to boost bilateral trade, it hasn't necessarily led to a significant *reduction* in India's trade deficit with Australia. Trade deficits are complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond a single trade agreement. The statement oversimplifies the impact of the ECTA.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The AIIPOIP is a broader initiative encompassing various aspects of cooperation beyond just military exercises and intelligence sharing. It includes collaborations in areas such as maritime security, sustainable development, and scientific research.  The statement presents a narrow and inaccurate portrayal of the partnership's scope. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n"
