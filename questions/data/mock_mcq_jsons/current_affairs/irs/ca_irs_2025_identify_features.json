The UNODC *does* publish the World Drug Report annually, but it covers a broader range of drugs than just cannabis, including opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The focus on cannabis production as the *primary* focus is a misleading distractor.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the INCB is involved in monitoring controlled substances, its mandate is much broader than just opium. It monitors the global trade in various drugs and precursors under international drug control treaties.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The CCPCJ's mandate encompasses a wide range of transnational organized crimes, not just cybercrime.  It addresses issues like drug trafficking, human trafficking, and corruption.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 2 (with the caveat about the misleading detail regarding the UNODC report's focus) are largely accurate.\n"

However, the phrasing of statement 4 is subtly misleading.  While India is a strong advocate for the goals of the Biological Weapons Convention,  it's important to note the subtle difference between being a \"party\" and having formally ratified it.

The 2024 Arab League Summit's location in Bahrain is a matter of public record. The AIIB's mandate includes assisting low-income countries, as confirmed by statements from the Union Finance Minister. The contested status of Nagorno-Karabakh, its dual names (Artsakh and Nagorno-Karabakh), and its official recognition as part of Azerbaijan are well-documented facts. The Nord Stream pipelines' function and location are widely known. The Kursk region's location relative to Ukraine and its inclusion of the Dnieper and Don river basins are accurate geographical details. Finally, the location of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, south of the Maldives, is a verifiable geographical fact.  Therefore, all six statements are correct.\n\n\n2. Consider the following:\n\n1.  The East Asia Summit includes ASEAN members plus Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US.\n2.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.\n3.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) operates on a principle of unanimity in decision-making.\n4.

The composition of the East Asia Summit, including the listed members, is correct. AITIGA's objective of reducing trade barriers between ASEAN and India is its core function. SAARC's decision-making process based on unanimity is a key characteristic. The Colombo Process focuses on migration management issues in the region. The inclusion of Bangladesh in the CSC is recent news. Finally, the WPFI 2024's release by RSF is a matter of public record.  Therefore, all six statements are true.\n\n\n3. Consider the following locations:\n\n1.  Lake Turkana (located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia)\n2.  Mount Kilimanjaro (located in Tanzania)\n3.  Lipulekh Pass (located near the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal)\n4.  Suez Canal (connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea)\n5.  The Gulf of Aden (a sea link between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea)\n6.

Lake Turkana's fish potential was recently surveyed. Mount Kilimanjaro featured in news related to an Indian expedition. The Lipulekh Pass is significant for border trade and pilgrimage. The Suez Canal has been in the news due to its role in global trade routes. The Gulf of Aden experiences pirate activity. The territorial dispute over Abu Musa Island between Iran and the UAE is an ongoing issue. Therefore, all six options are correct.\n\n\n4. Consider the following countries:\n\n1.

Ghana (borders Burkina Faso, Togo, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire)\n6.  Mali (borders Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, and Mauritania)\n\n\nHow many of the above countries are landlocked?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) Only four\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThree of the listed countries are landlocked: Rwanda, Mali, and the DRC.  Ukraine has extensive coastlines on the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Togo has a coastline on the Gulf of Guinea. Ghana also has a coastline on the Gulf of Guinea. Therefore, only Rwanda, Mali, and the DRC are landlocked.\n\n\n5. Consider the following:\n\n1.  The Tropic of Capricorn bisects Botswana.\n2.  The Tropic of Cancer passes through India.\n3.

The Tropic of Capricorn indeed bisects Botswana. The Tropic of Cancer passes through India. The Equator passes through Indonesia. The Arctic Circle passes through Norway. The Antarctic Circle passes through Chile.  The Prime Meridian does pass through Greenwich, England.  Therefore, all six statements accurately describe the geographical relationships.\n\n\n6. Consider the following statements regarding international organizations:\n\n1.  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is a currency swap agreement.\n2.  The Arab Maghreb Union aims to promote cooperation among five North African countries.\n3.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is involved in setting global economic policies.\n4.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) focuses on economic development.\n5.  The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with international trade regulations.\n6.  The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is responsible for maintaining international peace and security.\n\nHow many of the above statements accurately describe the functions or objectives of international organizations?\n\n(a) Only three\n(b) Only four\n(c) Only five\n(d) All six\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll six statements accurately describe the functions or objectives of the mentioned international organizations.  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is indeed a currency swap arrangement. The Arab Maghreb Union's focus on cooperation among North African countries is accurate. The IMF's role in global economic policy is well-known. The OECD focuses on economic development and related issues. The WTO's mandate includes international trade regulations.  The UNSC's responsibility for maintaining international peace and security is its primary function. Therefore, all six statements are correct.\n\n"

However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The INSTC is a multilateral initiative involving multiple countries, not solely India.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.\n\n\n10. Consider the following regarding regional organizations:\n\n1. BIMSTEC acquired legal personality after its charter came into force in May 2024.\n2.  The Quad Leaders' Summit adopted the Wilmington Declaration, outlining various collaborative initiatives.\n3.  SAARC has been largely dysfunctional since 2016, hindering regional cooperation.\n4.  The ASEAN Future Forum is a platform for ASEAN member states and partner countries to share ideas and policy recommendations.\n\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Three\n(d) All four\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d)\n\n**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate descriptions of the regional organizations mentioned. BIMSTEC's charter coming into force marks a significant step in its institutional development.  The Wilmington Declaration from the Quad Summit showcased collaborative efforts. The challenges faced by SAARC in recent years are well-documented.  The ASEAN Future Forum's role in facilitating dialogue and cooperation is also accurate.

Therefore, only three of the statements accurately identify the primary factions or drivers, making (c) the correct answer.  The description of the Kursk conflict as primarily between Russia and Ukraine is an oversimplification.\n"

IMEC focuses on connectivity, the SCO on broader security and economic cooperation, and the G7 on global economic governance and various initiatives, but not specifically on supply chain strengthening in a dedicated council format.  While supply chains may be indirectly impacted by the other initiatives, the question specifically asks about the primary focus.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include initiatives that do not have a dedicated council for supply chain strengthening as a primary focus.\n"
