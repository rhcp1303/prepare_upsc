        "explanation": "\n\nFast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) are a type of nuclear reactor that uses fast neutrons to induce fission in fissile material, primarily plutonium-239.  The \"fast\" designation refers to the high energy of the neutrons, which are not slowed down by a moderator as in other reactor types. This characteristic is crucial for their breeding capability.  Liquid sodium is a common coolant choice in FBRs because it does not moderate neutrons, allowing the fast neutron spectrum to be maintained.  A key feature of FBRs is their ability to breed fissile material, converting fertile isotopes like uranium-238 into fissile plutonium-239. This extends the usable lifespan of nuclear fuel and reduces the amount of waste.  Initially, many FBRs use MOX fuel, a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides.  Statement 5 is incorrect; FBRs do *not* operate at atmospheric pressure. They operate under high pressure to maintain the coolant in its liquid state and ensure efficient heat transfer.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe FBRs.\n"

The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, specifically Article 246, clearly defines the division of powers regarding taxation between the Union and the States, listing the subjects under the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Article 269 of the Constitution deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States.  This demonstrates a key aspect of fiscal federalism where the central government collects certain taxes but distributes a portion to the states.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Union Government plays a significant role, the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union is not solely determined by it.  The Finance Commission's recommendations heavily influence this distribution, ensuring a balance of power and resources between the Union and States.  Article 270 outlines this process.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  The Constitution does *not* prohibit discretionary grants. Article 282 allows the Union or a State to make grants for any public purpose, even outside their legislative competence. This flexibility is a crucial element of fiscal federalism, allowing for targeted assistance where needed.\n\nStatement 5 is incorrect.

Furthermore, biodiesel's compatibility with standard diesel engines is a significant advantage.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While biodiesel does produce slightly *higher* NOx emissions than petroleum diesel, it is not a *significant* increase.  The overall reduction in particulate matter, CO, and hydrocarbons typically outweighs the slight NOx increase, making biodiesel a net improvement in terms of air quality.  The emphasis on \"significantly\" makes this statement false in the context of the overall comparison.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because liquid nitrogen is explicitly described as non-flammable and non-corrosive. These are crucial safety features that distinguish it from other cryogenic fluids. Statement 2 is correct. Liquid nitrogen's extremely low temperature makes it ideal for cryotherapy (medical freezing) and rapid freezing of food products, preserving their quality during transportation and storage.  Statement 3 is correct, as -196\u00b0C is the accurate temperature of liquid nitrogen. Statement 4 is correct. The extremely low temperature of liquid nitrogen can cause rapid freezing of skin tissue and eye fluid, leading to severe cold burns and frostbite. This necessitates careful handling and safety precautions. Statement 5 is incorrect. Liquid nitrogen is not used in the artificial ripening of fruits. This process typically uses ethylene gas. Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe liquid nitrogen.\n"

Any source of ethylene gas coming in direct contact with fruits is permitted by FSSAI.\n3.  Ethylene is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable gas.\n4.  Ethylene is primarily used for freezing and transporting food products.\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?\n",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does indeed regulate the use of ethylene for artificial ripening, setting a maximum permissible concentration of 100 ppm to ensure food safety.  Going beyond this limit could lead to harmful effects on consumers.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Direct contact of ethylene gas with fruits is explicitly *not* permitted by FSSAI due to potential risks of uneven ripening and possibly harmful residue levels.  Controlled environment and application methods are necessary.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct. Ethylene is a colorless and odorless gas, but the statement is misleading as it omits the crucial fact that it is a flammable gas.  This omission makes the statement factually incomplete and therefore incorrect in the context of a precise MCQ.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. While ethylene is used in the food industry, its primary application is not freezing and transporting food products. That is a use case for liquid nitrogen. Ethylene's main role is in ripening.\n\nTherefore, only statements 1 and 3 (with the caveat about flammability) are partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer.\n"

Cas9 acts as molecular scissors, cutting the DNA at the target site.  This creates a double-strand break. The cell's repair mechanisms then either use Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) to repair the break, often introducing errors, or Homology Directed Repair (HDR), which utilizes a provided DNA template for precise repair.  While RNA Polymerase is crucial for *creating* the guide RNA, it's not directly involved in the DNA cleavage or modification itself.  Reverse Transcriptase is used in *some* CRISPR variations to convert RNA into DNA for insertion, but it is not a core component of the basic DNA cleavage mechanism.
