The Glycemic Index is a measure of how rapidly a carbohydrate-containing food elevates blood glucose levels after consumption, ranging from 0 to 100, with pure glucose at 100.\n2.  Professor David Jenkins of the University of Toronto proposed the GI in 1981, and it's primarily determined by internal factors such as amylose content, lipids, proteins, and dietary fiber.\n3. High GI foods contribute to rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, potentially stressing insulin production and utilization, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular issues in the long term.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(a) 1 and 3 only",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately defines the Glycemic Index (GI).  It's a numerical scale (0-100) that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods based on their effect on blood glucose levels after consumption.  Pure glucose, being the fastest-acting carbohydrate, serves as the reference point at 100.  Statement 3 correctly explains the health implications of high GI foods.  Foods with a high GI lead to a rapid spike in blood sugar levels.  This rapid increase forces the pancreas to produce large amounts of insulin to regulate blood sugar, potentially overwhelming the system over time.  This continuous stress on the insulin-producing cells increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, high GI diets are often associated with weight gain, increased triglyceride levels, and elevated blood pressure, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  However, statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Professor David Jenkins did indeed propose the GI in 1981,  the determination of GI is not solely based on internal factors. External factors such as cooking methods, processing techniques, and even the way food is stored significantly influence the GI of a food item.  The interaction between internal and external factors determines the final GI value.\n"

The process involves a strong magnetic field that aligns the hydrogen atoms in the body.  Radio waves are then used to perturb these aligned atoms, and the signals emitted as they return to their original alignment are detected and processed to generate images.  These images provide high resolution and excellent anatomical detail, allowing doctors to visualize various organs and tissues with remarkable clarity.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.

Exceeding the permitted concentration of 100 ppm (parts per million) can lead to negative consequences.  Statement 2 accurately describes another crucial FSSAI regulation. Direct contact between ethylene gas sources and fruits is strictly prohibited. This is to prevent uneven ripening, potential contamination, and to ensure that the ethylene gas is distributed properly and safely.  This controlled application method is crucial for food safety.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While controlled use of ethylene can be safe, it's not a universally accepted practice due to potential health and environmental concerns.

This process breaks down complex organic matter into simpler components: bio-oil (a liquid fuel), syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen), and biochar (a solid residue). Cracking is similar to pyrolysis, but it often involves the use of a catalyst to accelerate the breakdown of larger molecules into smaller, more desirable liquid fuel molecules, thereby improving the yield of liquid biofuels.  Hydrogenation is a chemical process used to enhance the quality and properties of bio-oil. In this process, hydrogen is added to bio-oil under high temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. This increases the energy content and improves the stability of the bio-oil, making it a more suitable fuel. Transesterification is a crucial process specifically used in biodiesel production.  It involves reacting vegetable oils or animal fats with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst. This reaction converts the triglycerides in the oils or fats into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), which constitute biodiesel, and glycerol, a byproduct.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Biodiesel can be produced from both vegetable oils and animal fats through the transesterification process. The use of animal fats is not universally prohibited, and many biodiesel producers utilize animal fats as feedstock, especially waste animal fats, to reduce reliance on vegetable oils.  The suitability of animal fats depends on factors such as purity, processing, and the intended application of the biodiesel.\n"

Diesel fuel does indeed have the highest energy density among the commonly used transportation fuels, which contributes to its efficiency in heavy-duty applications. Petrol (gasoline) follows with a somewhat lower energy density, making it suitable for various internal combustion engines. Biodiesel typically has a slightly lower energy density than diesel, and ethanol has the lowest energy density among the fuels listed, which is a key factor influencing its application and blending ratios in gasoline.  Statement 2 is also correct in highlighting the trade-offs associated with biodiesel and ethanol. Although biodiesel possesses a lower energy density than diesel, its advantages in terms of renewability and reduced emissions make it an attractive alternative fuel. This is especially important in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental impacts.  Similarly, ethanol's lower energy density is a limitation, but its renewable source and relatively clean burning characteristics make it a valuable component in fuel blends.

        "correct_option": "(a) 1 and 2 only",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately defines Gene-Drive Technology (GDT).  GDT is indeed a genetic engineering technique used to alter the natural inheritance patterns of genes within a population.  It aims to increase the probability of a specific gene being inherited by offspring, overriding the typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. This can be used to spread desirable traits or eliminate undesirable ones within a population more efficiently than conventional breeding methods.  Statement 2 correctly describes the key components of GDT systems.  A functional gene-drive system typically requires three main elements: a gene (the target gene to be spread), the Cas9 enzyme (a molecular scissor that cuts DNA at specific locations), and CRISPR (short palindromic repeats that guide the Cas9 enzyme to the target gene).  The genetic material encoding these three components is inserted into the organism's genome.  The Cas9 enzyme, guided by the CRISPR sequence, cuts the target gene, and the cell's repair mechanisms then incorporate a modified copy of the gene into the genome, ensuring the gene is inherited by offspring.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While GDT has shown promising results in controlling mosquito populations (by making them produce sterile offspring), its potential applications extend beyond mosquitoes.  Research is actively underway to explore GDT applications in various organisms, including other disease vectors, invasive species, and even for conservation purposes.  The feasibility and ethical implications of GDT are still being investigated in various species, and it's not limited to mosquitoes.\n"

Pure glucose, being the fastest-acting carbohydrate, has a GI of 100.  Foods with a high GI (above 70) raise blood sugar rapidly, while low GI foods (below 55) cause a slower, more gradual increase.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.

Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor in the treatment of methanol poisoning. Both methanol and ethanol are metabolized by the same enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase. By administering ethanol, a less toxic alcohol, it competes with methanol for the enzyme's active site, slowing down the conversion of methanol into its toxic metabolites (formaldehyde and formic acid).

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are derived from adult cells and can differentiate into all cell types of the body, similar to embryonic stem cells.\n3.  Stem cell therapy exclusively involves allogeneic transplantation, using stem cells from a donor to treat diseases.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew (divide and create more stem cells) and differentiate (develop into specialized cell types). This unique property makes them a focus of regenerative medicine research.  Their pluripotency or multipotency allows them to form a variety of different cell types, depending on the type of stem cell.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a revolutionary development in stem cell research.  Scientists can reprogram adult somatic cells (e.g., skin cells) back into a pluripotent state, meaning they can differentiate into any cell type in the body, similar to embryonic stem cells. This avoids the ethical concerns and limitations associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Stem cell therapy encompasses both autologous and allogeneic transplantation.  Autologous transplantation uses the patient's own stem cells, minimizing the risk of rejection. Allogeneic transplantation utilizes stem cells from a donor, requiring careful matching to reduce the risk of rejection.  The statement incorrectly limits stem cell therapy to only one method.\n"

Gene drive technology modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the likelihood that specific genes will be passed on to the next generation.\n2.  Gene drive systems consist of a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (acting as a molecular scissor), and CRISPR sequences, all inserted into an organism's DNA.\n3. GDT applications have shown promising results in reducing mosquito populations by increasing the frequency of genes that cause sterility in offspring, thereby impacting disease transmission.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Gene drive technology is a powerful genetic engineering technique that fundamentally alters the rules of inheritance.  It biases inheritance patterns, ensuring that a specific gene (or set of genes) is passed down to a much higher proportion of offspring than would be expected under normal Mendelian inheritance.  This allows for rapid spread of the modified gene within a population.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A typical gene drive system incorporates three key components: the target gene to be spread, the Cas9 enzyme (a DNA-cutting enzyme), and guide RNA sequences (CRISPR) that direct Cas9 to the specific location in the genome where the gene should be inserted or modified. These elements are integrated into the organism's genome to ensure their inheritance.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  One of the most promising applications of GDT is in controlling disease vectors, particularly mosquitoes. By introducing genes that cause sterility or other detrimental effects, GDT can significantly reduce mosquito populations, thereby impacting the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.  Successful field trials have demonstrated the potential of this technology.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does allow the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits. However, strict regulations are in place to ensure safety.  The permitted concentration is capped at 100 ppm (parts per million) to minimize potential health risks associated with excessive exposure to the gas. Direct contact with the gas source is prohibited.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is indeed used extensively in the food industry for its cryogenic properties.  Its extremely low temperature (-196\u00b0C) allows for rapid freezing of food products, preserving their quality and extending their shelf life.  However, direct skin contact with LN2 can cause severe cold burns or frostbite due to its extremely low temperature.  Proper safety measures are essential when handling liquid nitrogen.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the regulation of food additives and technologies varies slightly across states, the use of liquid nitrogen is not entirely unregulated across India.  The example given in the source content shows that at least one state (Tamil Nadu) actively monitors its use in food items, indicating a level of regulatory oversight.  This suggests that regulatory frameworks are in place, or in the process of being developed, in other states as well.  The statement is therefore an overgeneralization.\n"

This is a common approach, especially in bone marrow transplantation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While stem cells can be used in toxicology research, their primary application isn't assessing drug impact on the immune system. Instead, they are valuable tools for modeling drug effects on various cell types and tissues, helping to predict toxicity and efficacy before human clinical trials.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Radiometric dating is a powerful technique used in various fields, including archaeology and geology, to determine the age of materials.  It relies on the predictable and consistent decay rates of radioactive isotopes.  By comparing the ratio of parent isotope to daughter isotope, scientists can estimate the time elapsed since the material's formation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is a specific type of radiometric dating, but its application is limited.  It is primarily used for dating organic materials up to approximately 50,000 years old.  The half-life of Carbon-14 is relatively short, making it unsuitable for dating much older materials.  Other radiometric dating methods, employing isotopes with longer half-lives, are used for older materials.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a highly sensitive technique used to measure the abundance of rare isotopes, including long-lived ones like Calcium-41.  This technique enhances the precision and applicability of radiometric dating, particularly for materials where conventional methods may not be effective.  ATTA's sensitivity enables the measurement of isotopes present in extremely low concentrations.\n"

Transesterification is a chemical process where vegetable oils or animal fats react with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce FAMEs (biodiesel) and glycerol.  Fermentation is used in ethanol production. Statement 2 is correct. Ethanol, a biofuel produced via fermentation of sugars, has a lower energy density than petrol (gasoline). However, its renewable source and reduced greenhouse gas emissions make it a valuable alternative fuel.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While hydrogen is a clean fuel and its production via electrolysis using renewable energy is environmentally beneficial (\"green\" hydrogen), the process is currently energy-intensive and expensive.  The cost of renewable energy sources and the efficiency of the electrolysis process significantly impact the overall cost of hydrogen production.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.\n"

The annihilation of matter and antimatter is a fundamental principle of physics. When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they completely annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc\u00b2.  Statement 3 accurately describes the current state of antimatter production.  High-energy particle colliders, such as those at CERN, can produce antimatter by smashing particles together.  However, the process is extremely energy-intensive, making large-scale antimatter production economically unfeasible and technologically challenging at present.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Gene silencing is a process that regulates gene expression without permanently altering the DNA sequence.  It involves mechanisms that prevent or reduce the production of a protein from a gene, but the gene itself remains intact.  This is a key difference between gene silencing and gene editing, which does involve permanent changes to the DNA sequence.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful and widely used gene silencing technique.  It leverages small RNA molecules, such as siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) and miRNAs (microRNAs), to target specific mRNA molecules, leading to their degradation and preventing protein synthesis. This mechanism is crucial in regulating gene expression naturally and is also exploited in laboratory settings for research and therapeutic applications.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While gene silencing is a natural process observed in organisms, it is also extensively studied and manipulated in laboratories using various techniques, including RNAi, CRISPR-Cas9 systems (for targeted silencing), and other gene-editing tools. These techniques allow scientists to control gene expression for research purposes or to develop therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by gene overexpression or malfunction.\n\n"

The cells then translate this mRNA into the corresponding protein, which is presented to the immune system.  This harmless antigen triggers an immune response, preparing the body to fight off the actual virus if encountered later.  The mRNA itself is typically degraded shortly after it has been translated.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Unlike traditional vaccines, which utilize weakened or inactivated pathogens, mRNA vaccines use only the mRNA molecule carrying the genetic instructions for the antigen.  This method avoids the risks associated with using live or attenuated pathogens.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While mRNA vaccines are highly effective at generating a strong immune response, they typically do not provide lifelong immunity.  Booster shots are often necessary to maintain protection over time, as the level of antibodies produced by the initial vaccination can wane.  The duration of immunity can vary depending on factors such as the vaccine itself, the individual's immune response, and the nature of the pathogen.\n"

The chromosphere's temperature gradient, ranging from roughly 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top, is a well-established characteristic of this solar atmospheric layer.  This temperature increase is crucial for understanding energy transport within the Sun.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Sunspots and coronal holes are both darker and cooler than their surroundings, but their magnetic field configurations differ significantly. Sunspots possess intensely strong, tangled magnetic fields, leading to their characteristic appearance and activity. In contrast, coronal holes are characterized by open, unipolar magnetic fields, allowing the escape of solar wind plasma.  This distinction is a key aspect of solar physics.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.

Dicer does cleave long double-stranded RNA molecules into short fragments, but these are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), not microRNAs (miRNAs).  miRNAs are also short non-coding RNAs, but they are distinct from siRNAs in their origin and mechanism of action.  While both participate in RNA interference, siRNAs are generally exogenous (introduced from outside the cell), whereas miRNAs are endogenous (produced within the cell). The question plays on this subtle difference to create a distractor.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process and a powerful tool used in gene silencing. It involves the introduction of small RNA molecules (siRNAs or miRNAs) that target and bind to complementary mRNA sequences. This binding triggers the degradation of the mRNA molecule, preventing protein synthesis.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are, by definition, *not* translated into proteins. They are involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, but their mechanism of action in gene silencing differs from that of siRNAs or miRNAs. They primarily regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, often by interacting with chromatin or other regulatory molecules.

        "option_b": "1 and 3 only\n",
        "option_c": "1 only\n",
        "option_d": "2 and 3 only\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The first confirmed detection of exoplanets was in *1992*, not the 1970s.  This reflects the timeline of exoplanet discovery.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The transit method is a widely used technique for detecting exoplanets, relying on the subtle dimming of a star's light as a planet transits across its surface.  This accurately describes one of the key exoplanet detection methods.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Exoplanets are difficult to observe directly due to the overwhelming brightness of their host stars.  Indirect methods like the transit method are generally employed.  The statement misrepresents the observational challenges in exoplanet research.\n"
