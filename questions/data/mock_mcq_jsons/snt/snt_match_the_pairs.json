        "explanation": "\n\nPlant Tissue Culture (PTC) involves the cultivation of *undifferentiated* plant cells, tissues, or organs on synthetic media under aseptic conditions. Option 1 is therefore incorrect.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) accurately describes the transfer of the mother's nucleus (containing the majority of genetic material) to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) correctly describes the transfer of pronuclei (nuclear genetic material from both parents) from the mother's fertilized egg to a donor's fertilized egg with healthy mitochondria.  Option 4 is incorrect because CRISPR/Cas9 uses a different mechanism than zinc finger nucleases; it employs guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA sequences for cutting and editing. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (a) is correct because it accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.  Tantalum is indeed known for its high corrosion resistance, a key property that makes it valuable in various applications. Lithium is the lightest metal, possessing the lowest density among all metals. Carbon nanotubes, due to their unique structure, exhibit exceptionally high surface-to-volume ratios, leading to their use in diverse applications.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect because it includes White Phosphorus, which while used in some applications, is not primarily associated with fertilizers. The main use of white phosphorus is as an incendiary agent in military applications, though it does have some limited use in other applications. Its inclusion is a distractor playing on its chemical nature.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of Carbon Nanotubes with their high surface-to-volume ratio.  It only includes the correctly matched Tantalum and Lithium pairs.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Graphene with low thermal conductivity.  Graphene, in fact, is renowned for its exceptional thermal conductivity, a property that makes it very useful in electronics and other high-heat applications. This is a crucial distractor testing the candidate's knowledge of material properties.  The inclusion of White Phosphorus and omission of Graphene's high thermal conductivity makes this option highly flawed.\n\n\n"

This is a well-established fact within nuclear technology.\n\nPair 1 is incorrect because Fast Breeder Reactors primarily use a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides (MOX fuel), not solely Uranium-235.  The use of Uranium-235 is a distractor, playing on the fact that Uranium is a key component of nuclear fuel.\n\nPair 2 is incorrect. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be smaller and have a much lower power output than traditional nuclear reactors which typically exceed 1 GW. This is a deliberate distractor aiming to test understanding of reactor scale.\n\nPair 4 is incorrect. Thorium reactors, while still under development, would utilize thorium as fuel, not deuterium and tritium, which are isotopes of hydrogen used primarily in fusion reactors.  This is a distractor playing on the concepts of fission and fusion.\n\nPair 5 is incorrect. Tokamaks are a type of magnetic confinement fusion reactor, not inertial confinement.  Inertial confinement fusion uses lasers or particle beams to compress and heat fuel pellets. This is a key distractor focusing on the different approaches to fusion.\n\n\n"

Post-transcriptional gene regulation is primarily carried out by other types of non-coding RNA, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

Chandrayaan-3 achieved a soft landing near the lunar south pole and made other discoveries, but the detection of the hydroxyl radical (OH) is particularly associated with Chandrayaan-2. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are completely accurate.  Option (a) is incorrect because Chandrayaan-1 is not solely credited with Argon-40 detection. Option (c) is incorrect because while Chandrayaan-3 made significant discoveries, it's not primarily associated with the hydroxyl radical detection in this context.  Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairing Chandrayaan-1 and 3 with the listed findings.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nA coronagraph is specifically designed to block out the intense light from a central object (like the sun) to study fainter surrounding structures.  A telescope, in contrast, is a more general-purpose instrument used across various wavelengths.  Semi-cryogenic engines use liquid oxygen and refined kerosene, while cryogenic engines use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. High Altitude Pseudo Satellites (HAPS) operate at the specified altitude range. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatches in the descriptions of coronagraphs, semi-cryogenic and cryogenic engines.\n"
