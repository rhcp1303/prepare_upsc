        "option_b": "Agglutinates are sharp, angular soil grains with freshly fractured surfaces.\n",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because agglutinates are indeed a unique characteristic of lunar regolith. They are not simply one type of material (like volcanic glass or sharp soil grains), but rather a composite material.  Micrometeorite impacts are the primary process responsible for their formation. These impacts melt and fuse together fine-grained particles of lunar dust and soil, creating these distinctive, welded aggregates. Option (a) is incorrect because while volcanic glass is present in lunar regolith, it's not the defining characteristic of agglutinates. Option (b) describes the characteristics of individual soil grains, not the composite agglutinates. Option (d) is incorrect because, while some agglutinates may incorporate material from the lunar mantle, their formation is primarily a surface process related to micrometeorite impacts. The unique nature of agglutinates and their formation mechanism are crucial aspects of lunar geology.\n"

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe main challenge is the extreme temperature variations. The absence of an atmosphere on the Moon means there's no insulation against the intense solar radiation during the day and the extreme cold of the night. This dramatic temperature swing (from over 120\u00b0C to -130\u00b0C) can severely impact the electronics and other sensitive components of spacecraft. Options (b), (c), and (d) are all factors that affect lunar missions, but they are not the primary challenges during the lunar night.  Micrometeoroid impacts are a risk throughout the mission, not solely during the night. Reduced solar radiation is the reason for the temperature drop, not the primary challenge itself.  Dust accumulation is a concern, but temperature extremes pose a more significant threat to the survival of equipment.\n"

Firstly, LNPs provide significant stability to the inherently fragile mRNA molecule, protecting it from degradation by nucleases in the body. This enhanced stability translates to better efficacy, as a higher proportion of the mRNA reaches its target cells.  Secondly, LNPs are relatively easy to administer via intramuscular injection, a standard and well-established method.  Finally, the clinical trials of mRNA vaccines using LNPs, notably the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, have demonstrated high efficacy and safety profiles.  In contrast, free mRNA in solution is highly unstable and quickly degrades. Polymer-based delivery systems are still under development and face challenges in terms of biocompatibility and efficacy.

        "explanation": "\n\nmRNA vaccines work by instructing the host cell to produce viral proteins.  The mRNA, encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle, enters the host cell's cytoplasm. The cellular machinery then translates the mRNA into viral proteins, specifically those found on the surface of the target virus (e.g., the spike protein in COVID-19 vaccines).  These viral proteins are displayed on the cell surface, triggering an immune response.  The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign and mounts an attack, producing antibodies and activating T cells.  mRNA vaccines do *not* integrate into the host genome. They do not suppress host gene expression. While the innate immune system plays a role, the primary mechanism is the production of viral proteins that stimulate the adaptive immune response.\n"

This repulsive force, described by Coulomb's Law, increases dramatically as the nuclei get closer. To overcome this repulsion and initiate fusion, extremely high temperatures and pressures are needed to provide the kinetic energy necessary to force the nuclei close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and bind them together. Option (a) is incorrect as there is no such protective layer; (c) is wrong because the energy released in fusion currently exceeds the energy required to initiate it, but the technology to efficiently harness the net energy is still under development; (d) is partially correct, as plasma is a necessary state, but it doesn't define the Coulomb Barrier itself.\n"

Electroporation is a method used to introduce genetic material into cells by creating temporary pores in the cell membrane.  mRNA therapies using LNPs are indeed highly efficacious and have demonstrated a good safety profile in numerous clinical trials, but the LNP encapsulation itself is the key to stability and room temperature storage, not electroporation.  Option (a) is incorrect because LNPs, while offering improved stability compared to other methods, still often require cold storage. Option (b) is incorrect because direct injection lacks the precision and controlled delivery offered by other methods, making it less efficient, and its safety and efficacy haven't been established across the board.  Option (d) is partially true; viral or bacterial vectors can indeed take longer to develop, but their stability depends heavily on the specific vector and the storage conditions.  The statement that they are generally more stable at room temperature is a significant oversimplification.\n"

This precise gene-editing technique allowed researchers to reduce the glucosinolate content, resulting in a less pungent taste, comparable to canola. Option (a) is incorrect; gene editing does not necessarily involve GMOs. Option (b) is incorrect; the main achievement was a *reduction* in glucosinolate content.

The extreme speed of lunar modules upon entering the lunar atmosphere necessitates a precise and controlled deceleration to zero velocity for a safe landing.  Lunar dust can also significantly impair the functionality of cameras and other vital sensors. However, the Moon lacks a substantial atmosphere. This absence of atmospheric drag makes controlled descent significantly more difficult, as parachutes cannot be used to slow the spacecraft's descent.  Instead, the lander relies entirely on its thrusters for precise maneuvering and braking, increasing the complexity and precision required for a successful soft landing.

In the case of the Earth-Moon system, tidal locking results in the Moon always presenting the same face to the Earth.  This synchronization between the Moon's rotation and its orbit around Earth is due to the gravitational pull exerted by both bodies on each other, causing a distortion in their shapes and slowing down the Moon's rotation. While the Sun's gravity influences the Moon's orbit, the primary driver of tidal locking is the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. The Moon's rotational speed is essentially constant due to tidal locking, and tidal locking is not directly involved in causing lunar eclipses, which are caused by the alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

        "explanation": " This question assesses knowledge of a specific type of power generation system used in space exploration.  The description of an RTG clearly outlines its components: a Radioisotope Heater Unit (RHU) for heat generation, a heat-to-electricity conversion mechanism (often using thermocouples), and batteries for storing the generated electricity.  Solar panels are not a component of an RTG, as RTGs are designed to function independently of sunlight, making them suitable for deep space missions. The correct identification of this detail shows a strong understanding of RTG technology.\n"

        "explanation": " This question assesses basic understanding of optics. A magnifying glass uses a convex lens to enlarge the image of an object.  Convex lenses converge light rays, while concave lenses diverge them.  Plano-concave and concavo-convex lenses are variations of concave lenses and would not magnify an object.  The ability to recall this fundamental optical principle is essential.\n"

High-GI foods cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, which can be problematic for people with diabetes because their bodies struggle to regulate these spikes effectively.
