These edits can involve alien genetic material, making the end result distinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.\n2.

Gene-drive technology is a form of genome editing that utilizes SDNs to modify an organism's DNA, potentially impacting physical traits and disease susceptibility.  Crucially, while some GDT applications might not involve alien genetic material (SDN1 and SDN2), others do utilize foreign genes (SDN3), resulting in a product that differs from conventionally bred varieties.  The statement accurately reflects this variability in the application of GDT within the broader context of GE.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While CRISPR/Cas9 is indeed a gene editing technology used to create the low-pungent mustard, classifying it solely as SDN2 is an oversimplification. The CRISPR/Cas9 system's versatility allows for modifications that could fall under SDN1, SDN2, or SDN3, depending on the specific approach and the nature of the genetic material introduced or removed.  The fact that the low-pungent mustard example *did not* use foreign genetic material doesn't mean all CRISPR/Cas9 applications are limited to SDN2.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nBoth statements accurately reflect aspects of the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load.  Statement 1 correctly defines the core principle of the GI:  foods with a higher GI value cause a faster and more significant rise in blood glucose levels after consumption than foods with a lower GI. This is because of differences in the rate of carbohydrate digestion and absorption.  Statement 2 is also correct, as the Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive metric than the GI alone. While the GI ranks foods based on their rate of glucose absorption, the GL takes into account both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates present in a typical serving. This provides a more accurate reflection of the overall impact of a food on blood sugar levels, making it a more useful tool for dietary management, especially for individuals with diabetes. Therefore, both statements are true and accurately describe the concepts of GI and GL.\n"

It has a faintly sweet, pungent odor.  Its primary use is not as a solvent in plastics production; rather, it finds applications in various chemical processes, including the synthesis of  dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Statement 2 is correct. The treatment of methanol poisoning focuses on inhibiting the metabolism of methanol by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.  This is achieved by administering ethanol, which competes with methanol for the enzyme's active site, slowing down the conversion of methanol to its toxic metabolites (formaldehyde and formic acid). Fomepizole is another antidote that acts as a more specific and potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of methanol and its toxicology.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is fundamentally different from X-rays in that it does not utilize ionizing radiation.  X-rays use high-energy electromagnetic radiation that can potentially damage cells and DNA. MRI, on the other hand, employs a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate images. This makes MRI a safer imaging modality, especially for repeated scans or for patients who are sensitive to ionizing radiation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  MRI is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that provides detailed images of the body's internal structures.  It works by using a powerful magnetic field to align the hydrogen atoms within the body's tissues.  Radio waves are then used to perturb these aligned atoms, and the signals emitted as the atoms return to their original state are detected and processed by a computer to construct detailed images. The technique is non-invasive, avoiding the need for surgical procedures or injections of contrast agents in most cases.\n"

This sensitivity makes them suitable for detecting minute changes in magnetic fields, which can be translated into valuable diagnostic information.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.

Nuclear fission involves the *splitting* of a heavy atomic nucleus (like uranium or plutonium) into smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy.  In contrast, nuclear fusion involves the *combining* or merging of two light atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen) to form a heavier nucleus (like helium), also releasing a substantial amount of energy.  The energy released in fusion is even greater than that in fission, per unit mass.  This distinction is crucial to understanding the different processes and their applications.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Nuclear fusion reactions require extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged atomic nuclei.  These extreme conditions create a state of matter called plasma, a highly ionized gas where electrons are stripped from atoms, resulting in a mixture of positive ions and free electrons.  The plasma state is essential for fusion to occur because it allows the nuclei to get close enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and fuse together.  The sustained confinement and heating of plasma are significant challenges in achieving controlled nuclear fusion.\n"

While it can detect some near-infrared light, its main focus is on observing the universe in the infrared spectrum. This is crucial because infrared light can penetrate dust clouds that obscure visible light, allowing the JWST to see objects that are hidden from visible-light telescopes.  The high resolution is a product of its large mirror and sophisticated instruments, but the primary observational range is infrared.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The JWST's infrared capabilities are specifically designed to detect the faint heat signatures of distant objects, including galaxies formed in the early universe.  The infrared light emitted by these objects is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, making it undetectable by visible light telescopes. The JWST's advanced infrared detectors can capture this redshifted light, providing invaluable data for understanding the universe's formation and evolution. This is a key advantage over previous telescopes and justifies its high cost and complexity.\n"

This limitation is a trade-off for the benefits of using a liquid fuel.\n"

Elemental semiconductors are made of a single type of atom (e.g., silicon or germanium), while compound semiconductors are formed from a combination of two or more different elements (e.g., gallium arsenide). This is a fundamental concept in semiconductor physics.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  It reverses the roles of electrons and holes in N-type and P-type semiconductors. N-type semiconductors are created by doping with elements that contribute extra electrons, leading to electron-dominated current flow. Conversely, P-type semiconductors are formed by doping with elements that create \"holes\" (electron deficiencies), resulting in current flow primarily through these holes.  This reversal serves as a potent distractor, relying on the candidate's potential confusion regarding the terminology and the underlying mechanisms of charge carrier movement in doped semiconductors.\n"

The need for extreme pressure conditions is a significant hurdle, as many materials cannot withstand such pressures without structural failure.  The failure to form Cooper pairs (pairs of electrons that move through the material without resistance) at higher temperatures is a fundamental limitation.  Thermal energy at room temperature disrupts the delicate balance required for Cooper pair formation, causing scattering and resistance.  Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects the scientific obstacles. Statement 2 contains a factual error regarding the discovery date of the Meissner Effect. While the Meissner Effect is indeed the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor below its critical temperature, it was discovered much earlier than 2011, by Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld in 1933. This incorrect date renders the statement inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n"

This protein is then displayed on the cell surface, prompting an immune response.\n\n2.  The mRNA in mRNA vaccines integrates with the host cell's DNA, permanently altering the genetic makeup of the cell to provide long-term immunity.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately describes the mechanism of mRNA vaccines. The mRNA instructs the cell to produce a viral protein (like the spike protein in COVID-19 vaccines), which is then presented on the cell surface. This triggers the immune system to produce antibodies, providing immunity.  The mRNA itself is degraded by the cell shortly after the protein is produced; it does not become part of the cell's DNA.  This is a key advantage of mRNA vaccines, as it reduces the risk of unintended genetic modification.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. A critical feature of mRNA vaccines is that the mRNA does *not* integrate with the host cell's DNA. It operates solely in the cytoplasm of the cell to direct protein synthesis, and is then broken down.  The idea of permanent genetic alteration is a significant misunderstanding of how mRNA vaccines function. This misconception is a common source of vaccine hesitancy, and it's important to clarify that mRNA vaccines do not alter the recipient's genome. The immunity provided is temporary and requires booster shots to maintain protection.\n"

The goal is to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases by replacing the mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.  Crucially, the child's nuclear DNA, which carries the majority of the genetic information determining the child's traits and characteristics, remains from the biological parents.  This ensures the child is genetically related to its parents, while avoiding the inheritance of potentially debilitating mitochondrial diseases.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  MRT techniques do *not* replace the mother's nuclear DNA.  The nuclear DNA, containing the vast majority of the genetic material, remains from the intended parents.  Only the mitochondria, which are responsible for energy production within the cell and contain their own separate DNA, are replaced.  The claim that the entire nuclear DNA is replaced is a fundamental misunderstanding of the procedure's mechanics.

The development of immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity, distinguishing it from innate immunity.\n\n\nStatement 2 describes innate immunity, not adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense, acting rapidly and non-specifically against a wide range of pathogens.  It does not involve the development of immunological memory.

While Dicer is indeed an enzyme that cleaves long double-stranded RNA molecules into shorter fragments, these fragments are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), not microRNAs (miRNAs).  miRNAs are a distinct class of small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, often originating from distinct genomic locations and processed differently than siRNAs.  The confusion arises because both siRNAs and miRNAs are involved in RNA interference and share some functional similarities, but their origins and processing pathways differ significantly.  This subtle distinction makes statement 1 factually inaccurate.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process and a powerful tool in biotechnology. It uses small RNA molecules, including siRNAs and miRNAs, to target specific mRNA molecules for degradation or translational repression.  This mechanism effectively silences gene expression by preventing the synthesis of proteins encoded by the targeted mRNAs. This statement accurately reflects the core principle and application of RNAi in gene silencing.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.\n"

        "option_a": "1 only\n",
        "option_b": "2 only\n",
        "option_c": "Both 1 and 2\n",
        "option_d": "Neither 1 nor 2\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is limited in its application. Its half-life of approximately 5,700 years restricts its use to dating materials that are relatively recent (up to around 50,000 years old).  Geological formations that are millions of years old require other radiometric dating methods that utilize isotopes with much longer half-lives, such as potassium-argon or uranium-lead dating.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Calcium-41, possessing a significantly longer half-life than Carbon-14, presents a promising alternative for dating older materials. Its relatively long half-life extends the timeframe for accurate dating beyond the limitations of Carbon-14. The use of Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) enhances the precision of Calcium-41 dating.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While particle accelerators are a primary method of producing antimatter, it also occurs naturally in processes like cosmic ray collisions and some radioactive decays. The current production in accelerators is indeed limited, but the scale is nanograms, not milligrams, reflecting the challenges and costs involved.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. PET scans effectively utilize antimatter in the form of positrons.  Positrons, the antiparticles of electrons, are introduced into the body. When they encounter electrons, annihilation occurs, producing gamma rays that are detected to create the medical image. This process provides valuable diagnostic information.\n"

The SCE-200 uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 kerosene, not liquid hydrogen (LH2), as propellants.  The use of RP-1 kerosene makes it a semi-cryogenic engine, distinct from fully cryogenic engines that employ LH2.  The SCE-200 is intended for the LVM3 and future heavy-lift vehicles.\n"

While they are often associated with sunspots, which are regions of intense magnetic activity, the flares themselves are powerful eruptions of energy in the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Solar winds are indeed a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona.  These winds travel at extremely high speeds, exceeding one million kilometers per hour, and interact with planetary magnetospheres, influencing space weather phenomena like auroras and geomagnetic storms.
