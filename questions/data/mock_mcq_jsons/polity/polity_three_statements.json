The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by directing the state to adopt policies promoting social and economic justice.\n2.

Statement 1 correctly highlights the overarching goal of the DPSP: to establish a welfare state committed to social and economic justice.  Statement 2 accurately points out the non-justiciable nature of the DPSP; they serve as guidelines for the state's actions but are not legally enforceable in courts.  Statement 3 correctly explains that the DPSP provides a framework for social and economic development and guides the state's policy-making, aiming for a just and equitable society.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete representations of the DPSP's nature and purpose.\n"

This standardized structure aimed for uniformity in rural local governance.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Act provides flexibility for states with populations below 20 lakhs.  Such states may opt not to establish the intermediate-level Panchayats, streamlining the structure to a two-tier system (village and district levels).  This recognizes that smaller states may not require a three-tier structure for effective governance.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment advocates for direct elections to all seats at the village level, the Chairpersons of the intermediate and district-level Panchayats are elected indirectly \u2013 by and from amongst the elected members of those bodies. This indirect election process is a key feature of the Panchayati Raj system's structure.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nWhile Article 5 is a crucial provision for citizenship by birth, it is not the sole determinant. Other articles, such as Articles 6 and 8, deal with specific circumstances of citizenship acquisition. This makes statement 1 incorrect. Parliament has significant power to amend citizenship laws, but such power is not unlimited. Judicial review can still apply to such amendments, particularly if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution. This makes statement 2 incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly forbid dual citizenship in all cases; the Citizenship Act allows for certain forms of dual citizenship under specific conditions.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Consequently, none of the statements are completely correct.\n"

The principle of treating equals equally is a fundamental tenet of fairness, ensuring that individuals in similar situations are treated identically.

A surgeon's expertise and the risks involved in their work justify higher compensation than a less demanding job, even though both are valuable to society.  Finally, the recognition of special needs is crucial for social justice.  It acknowledges that not all individuals start from the same baseline, and some require additional support to achieve equality of opportunity. This is particularly relevant in contexts of disability, poverty, or historical disadvantage, where affirmative action or targeted interventions might be needed to redress existing imbalances.

The parliamentary system promotes flexibility and responsiveness, allowing for changes in leadership without the need for a lengthy electoral process.  However, it also carries the risk of instability if the ruling coalition loses its majority.\n"

While the President can withhold assent to an ordinary bill, this power does not extend to Money Bills.

Article 21, through judicial interpretation, has broadened the scope of the right to life to include the right to a healthy environment.  This is a crucial aspect of environmental jurisprudence in India. Article 275(1) explicitly addresses the allocation of funds to improve governance and welfare in Scheduled Areas, focusing on the Scheduled Tribes' well-being. This provision acknowledges the unique needs and challenges faced by these communities.  Finally, Article 243(A) specifically outlines the constitution, powers, and responsibilities of the Gram Sabha, a crucial element of local self-governance in India.  Therefore, all three statements are correct representations of constitutional provisions.\n"

Gandhi's focus was on social harmony and reform, but a uniform civil code is a complex issue with varied interpretations.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 directly reflect Gandhian principles.  The emphasis on village Panchayats (statement 2) reflects his vision of decentralized governance and empowerment at the grassroots level.

Securing leisure and cultural opportunities (statement 4) resonates with his emphasis on the holistic development of the individual, encompassing both material and spiritual well-being.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 most accurately represent the Gandhian principles embedded in the Directive Principles.\n"

Statement 2 correctly highlights the role of Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) in shaping the state's obligations.  While DPSPs are not directly justiciable, the state's failure to provide food security, as mandated by DPSPs, can indirectly impact the justiciable right to life, making it a relevant consideration.

The Supreme Court has the power to adjudicate disputes between the Union and one or more States, and also between two or more States.

Disputes regarding elections are primarily handled by Election Tribunals and High Courts, and only through appeal do they reach the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the correct answer is (b).  It is important to distinguish between the Supreme Court's original and appellate jurisdiction.\n"

The Government of India Act, 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced several significant changes to the Indian governance system.  Diarchy, a system of dual governance dividing subjects between Indian and British officials, was introduced at the provincial level.  Separate communal electorates were introduced, giving separate representation to different religious communities, particularly Muslims.  The Act also devolved some legislative authority from the central government to the provinces, granting them greater autonomy in certain matters.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d) as all three features were key elements of the 1919 Act.  These reforms, though limited, marked a step toward greater Indian participation in governance.\n"

The Annual Financial Statement (budget) is presented to Parliament for scrutiny and approval.  The Appropriation Bill, which authorizes the government to spend the allocated funds, must be passed by Parliament before any money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.  The Finance Bill, which deals with taxation and other financial matters, also requires parliamentary approval. Statement 4, while desirable for enhanced oversight, is not a formally established constitutional or statutory mechanism.

This differs from an absolute veto, where the President's decision is final.  The qualified nature acknowledges the legislative process's supremacy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The President's power to return a bill is not absolute.  There is a mechanism for the legislature to pass the bill again if the President returns it for reconsideration.  The President's ability to return bills is a crucial part of the checks and balances system but is not an absolute power.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. A pocket veto occurs when the President neither signs nor vetoes a bill within the prescribed time frame, allowing the bill to lapse.  This is distinct from a direct veto, which involves an explicit rejection.  The pocket veto is a subtle but powerful tool, reflecting the balance of power between the executive and legislature.\n"

Larger states have a greater number of representatives than smaller states, ensuring that their interests are proportionally considered in the legislative process.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Local self-government in India is primarily a form of *democratic decentralization*, not direct democracy. While it increases citizen participation, it operates through elected representatives at the local level, not direct decision-making by all citizens on all matters.\n"
