The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is the landmark judgment that introduced the basic structure doctrine. This doctrine has indeed increased the judiciary's power of judicial review, and it's generally accepted across the political spectrum, though the precise definition of the basic structure remains a subject of ongoing debate.

This is a key aspect of inclusive governance.\n\n2. **Mandatory Periodic Elections:**  The 74th Amendment Act enshrines the principle of regular elections, ensuring democratic accountability and preventing the concentration of power. The five-year cycle is a common practice, though variations might exist based on state-level laws.\n\n3. **Governor's Role in Account Maintenance and Audit:** The state governor's power to determine accounting and audit procedures reflects the state's overall oversight of urban local bodies.

The Act ensures regular and periodic elections, every five years, to maintain democratic accountability and prevent stagnation in municipal governance.  Regular elections are vital for a healthy democracy at the local level.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the State Legislature has the power to make provisions regarding the maintenance of accounts and auditing, the State Governor does not directly decide the procedure.

The Act explicitly provides for the constitution of Nagar Panchayats to cater to the administrative needs of smaller urban areas.  This is a key feature of the tiered structure of urban local bodies.\n\nStatement 5 is correct.

Statement 5 is true as well; the Constitution mandates reserving at least one-third of seats for women, in addition to any seats already reserved for SC/ST women.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the State Governor has a role in overseeing the functioning of municipalities,  the exact procedures for maintaining accounts and conducting audits are typically determined by state legislation, not directly by the Governor.  The Governor's role is more of an oversight and approval rather than a direct determination of these procedures.\n"

In FPTP, a single representative is elected from each constituency, fostering direct accountability between the representative and their local voters.  Voters can directly judge their representative's performance and hold them responsible.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. PR systems aim to allocate seats proportionally to the votes received by different parties, thereby giving a voice to even smaller parties or minority groups that might not win any seats under FPTP.  This is particularly crucial for geographically dispersed minorities.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While PR aims for proportionality, it doesn't always achieve a perfect match between vote share and seat allocation.  Various PR formulas exist, and each has its own nuances regarding proportionality.  Factors like electoral thresholds and the specific formula used can lead to deviations from perfect proportionality.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. FPTP allows voters to support individual candidates irrespective of their party preferences.  A voter can choose the candidate they deem most suitable, even if they are from a party the voter doesn't typically support.  This contrasts with PR systems where the party list often dominates the selection of representatives.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nArticles 14, 17, 21, and 23 are directly concerned with the core aspects of social justice and equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws.  Article 17 abolishes untouchability, a practice that historically perpetuated social inequality. Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty, an essential element of social justice. Article 23 prohibits forced labour and human trafficking, vital for ensuring social justice. Article 25, while related to fundamental rights, focuses primarily on religious freedom rather than direct aspects of social justice and equality.  Therefore, only Articles 14, 17, 21, and 23 are most directly linked to the goal of social justice and equality.\n"

Statement 2 is also incorrect; it did not establish a fully responsible government at the center.  The executive remained largely under British control.  Statement 3 is correct; dyarchy (dual governance) was introduced at the provincial level, dividing the subjects into transferred and reserved subjects.  Statement 4 is largely correct; the Act did expand the Indian legislature's powers, although it remained significantly limited compared to a fully sovereign body.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 accurately depict aspects of the 1919 Act.\n"

Proportionate justice is demonstrated through bonuses for high-performing employees, recognizing their superior effort and skill.  Finally, the provision of additional support for employees with disabilities addresses the recognition of special needs.\n\nOption (b) only demonstrates equal opportunity and proportionate justice (rewarding high achievers).  It fails to address the special needs of students with disabilities.\n\nOption (c) only focuses on addressing historical inequalities through affirmative action, neglecting both proportionate justice and the special needs of individuals outside the affirmative action framework.\n\nOption (d) addresses the special needs of the disadvantaged (basic needs) but ignores both equal treatment for equals (in terms of opportunities and rewards) and the principle of proportionate justice, which recognizes that individuals should be rewarded according to their efforts and skills.  A truly just society should strive to balance all three.\n"

It does not advocate solely for merit-based rewards.\n\nStatement 3 is completely contrary to Rawls' theory.  He explicitly argues against a system that prioritizes the most privileged, emphasizing instead the need for a \"difference principle\" that ensures that inequalities benefit the least advantaged.\n"

This is a hallmark of federal systems.\n\nAn independent judiciary is essential for maintaining the balance of power in a federation.  The judiciary acts as an arbiter between the Union and States, ensuring that neither oversteps its constitutional boundaries.\n\nDistribution of powers, between the Union and States, is another core tenet of federalism. This division is enshrined in the Constitution, defining which areas of governance fall under the Union's purview and which are reserved for the States.\n\nThe supremacy of the constitution is central to the Indian federal system.  Both the Union and the State governments are bound by the provisions of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land.\n\nA rigid constitution is not necessarily a defining feature of all federations. While the Indian Constitution is difficult to amend, requiring specific procedures, this is not the defining characteristic of all federal systems.

The President is elected separately from the legislature and serves for a fixed term.  Separation of powers is a core principle, with distinct branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) having clearly defined roles and powers.  In contrast, the parliamentary system features a dual executive (Prime Minister and Head of State), collective responsibility of the cabinet, and a fusion of powers between the executive and legislature. A fixed term for the legislature is common to both systems, although the executive's term may vary. Therefore, only two features (single executive and separation of powers) are exclusively associated with the Presidential system.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include features present in both or primarily in the parliamentary system.\n"

Option 2 is incorrect because while the concept of natural rights underpins many democratic principles, the right to vote isn't a universally recognized natural right independent of legal systems. Its existence and specific parameters are defined by a nation's laws and constitution. Option 4 is also incorrect because the Preamble doesn't specifically mention the right to vote; it outlines the goals and aspirations of the Indian nation, but the mechanics of electoral rights are defined elsewhere in the Constitution. Option 3 is correct because the Constitution mandates that voting rights can be granted to citizens who fulfil specific criteria, like age, registration, and citizenship status.  These eligibility criteria are defined through legislation, not the Constitution itself.

Statement 1 is incorrect, as the executive and legislature are interconnected in a parliamentary system; the executive is drawn from the legislature.

Asymmetric federalism (Statement 1): This refers to the special provisions granted to certain states, such as Jammu & Kashmir (before its reorganization), through Articles 370 and 371. This creates a tiered system of federalism, defying the classical understanding of equal treatment for all units.\n\n2. Unequal representation in Rajya Sabha (Statement 2): The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, does not have equal representation for states. This is a departure from the classical concept of federalism, where equal representation of states in a bicameral legislature is often a key feature.\n\n3. Strong central government (Statement 3):  India has a strong central government with significant power over the states.

It cannot amend the core foundational principles of the Constitution. Therefore, this statement is partially incorrect.\n\n2.  **Power to Create All-India Services:** The Parliament has the power to create new All-India Services under Article 312. This is a crucial aspect of maintaining administrative uniformity across the country.  This statement is correct.\n\n3.  **Power to Alter State Boundaries:** The Parliament possesses the power to form new states and alter the areas, boundaries, or names of existing states (Article 3). This is essential for administrative reorganization and national integration. This statement is correct.\n\n4.  **Legislation on State List Matters:** Under Article 249, the Parliament can legislate on matters in the State List in the national interest if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to this effect. This is a crucial provision for addressing national concerns that transcend state boundaries. This statement is correct.\n\n5.  **Doctrine of Basic Structure:** The Supreme Court has established the doctrine of basic structure, which limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.

However, the state must maintain neutrality and avoid favoring any particular religion. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Freedom to Practice Religion:** Article 25 guarantees the freedom to practice, profess, and propagate one's religion. This is a fundamental right that is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, and health.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 are largely correct. Local self-government in India is primarily focused on democratic decentralization, empowering local communities. It involves delegating administrative powers from higher levels.  The 73rd (Panchayats) and 74th (Municipalities) Amendments were landmark steps in strengthening local governance.  However, statement 3 is an oversimplification; while local self-government promotes participation, it's not purely direct democracy. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while the amendments provided for more financial resources, local bodies don't have complete financial autonomy and are dependent on higher levels of government to some extent.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the core aspects of local self-government in India.\n"

Option 3 is correct because the right to vote is subject to conditions like age, citizenship, and registration on electoral rolls.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy incorporate several principles aligned with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.  Organizing village Panchayats (2) reflects Gandhi's emphasis on decentralized governance and Gram Swaraj. Promoting cottage industries (3) aligns with his vision of rural self-sufficiency and employment generation. Securing reasonable leisure and cultural opportunities for workers (4) resonates with his broader focus on social justice and the dignity of labor.  A uniform civil code (1), while not explicitly a Gandhian principle, can be seen as indirectly aligned with his vision of a unified and equitable society.  However, prioritizing industrialization (5) directly contradicts Gandhi's emphasis on rural development and sustainable livelihoods. Therefore, only four of the listed statements are accurate reflections of Gandhian ideals within the Directive Principles.\n"
