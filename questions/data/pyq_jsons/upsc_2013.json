        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\n\nexplanation:A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House).  The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) cannot reject a Money Bill, but it can only make recommendations within 14 days of receiving it. The Lok Sabha can then choose to accept or reject these recommendations. If the Lok Sabha doesn't return the bill to the Rajya Sabha within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed in its original form.  Therefore, the Lok Sabha can send the bill back to the Rajya Sabha for reconsideration if it chooses to do so.\n\n\nLok Sabha: The lower house of the Indian Parliament, possessing more power than the Rajya Sabha in financial matters.  It's primarily responsible for initiating and passing Money Bills.\n\nRajya Sabha: The upper house of the Indian Parliament.  While it can review and recommend amendments to Money Bills, it cannot ultimately reject them.\n\nMoney Bill: A bill that deals primarily with matters related to taxation, government spending, and borrowing.  It has a special procedure for passage, giving the Lok Sabha greater control.\n\nPresident:  The head of state in India. While they can give or withhold assent to a bill, the procedure for a Money Bill is relatively straightforward once the Lok Sabha has passed it.  A joint sitting is not involved in the process of a Money Bill.\n"

        "correct_option": "a",
        "subject": "polity",
        "year": 2013,
        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (a)\n\n* **explanation:** The statement (a) is correct.  The Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly prohibit a person from being appointed as Governor for multiple states simultaneously, but it's a convention that a single individual doesn't hold the governorship of more than one state at the same time.  This is due to the demanding nature of the role and the need for focused attention on each state's unique governance needs.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect.  High Court judges are appointed by the President, not the Governor. Option (c) is incorrect; the Governor can be removed by the President. Option (d) is incorrect;  in Union Territories with legislatures, the Chief Minister is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, but the appointment is based on the individual's ability to command a majority in the legislature.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Important Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Governor:** The Governor is the constitutional head of a state in India. Appointed by the President, they act as a representative of the central government in the state, but their powers are largely symbolic. They play a crucial role in the formation and dissolution of state governments, but their decisions are usually guided by the advice of the Council of Ministers.\n\n* **Chief Minister:** The Chief Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers in a state. They are appointed by the Governor and are usually the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislative assembly. The Chief Minister's office is the de facto executive authority in the state.  They are responsible for the overall administration and governance of the state.\n\n* **High Court:** The High Court is the highest court of a state in India.  It's responsible for upholding the rule of law within its jurisdiction.  Judges are appointed by the President of India, based on recommendations from the collegium system.\n\n* **Union Territory:** A Union Territory is an administrative division of India that is directly governed by the central government.  Some Union Territories have legislatures, while others do not.\n\n* **Lieutenant Governor:** The Lieutenant Governor is the head of a Union Territory. Their powers and functions are similar to those of a Governor in a state, but they are appointed by the President and report directly to the central government.\n\n* **President:** The President of India is the head of state.  While largely ceremonial, their role is important in matters of national and state governance, including appointments to key positions such as Governors and High Court judges.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers.\n\n* **Council of Ministers:**  The Council of Ministers is the body of ministers responsible for advising the Governor (in a state) or the President (at the national level).  In a state, the Chief Minister heads the Council of Ministers.  The Council is the real executive power in the government.\n\n* **Articles 163, 164, 167:** These articles of the Indian Constitution deal with the Council of Ministers, their relationship with the Governor, and the role of the Chief Minister. Article 163 establishes the Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor, Article 164 deals with the appointment of ministers, and Article 167 outlines the duties of the Chief Minister regarding the Governor.\n\n\nThe states mentioned (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka) are all states within the Republic of India, each with its own Governor, Chief Minister, and legislative assembly.\n"

        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (d)\n* **explanation:** The variation in the length of daytime and nighttime throughout the year is primarily caused by the tilt of Earth's axis (23.5 degrees) as it revolves around the Sun.  This tilt means that different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year.  When a hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences longer days and shorter nights (summer), while the opposite hemisphere experiences shorter days and longer nights (winter).\n\nThe Earth's rotation on its axis causes day and night, but not the seasonal variation in their lengths. The Earth's revolution around the sun in an elliptical orbit does slightly affect the length of seasons, but the primary cause is the axial tilt. Latitudinal position affects the amount of sunlight received, leading to differences in temperature, but doesn't directly explain the seasonal change in day length.\n\n\n**Short notes on keywords and named entities:**\n\n* **Earth:** The fifth largest planet in our solar system, Earth is the only known planet to support life.  It has a roughly spherical shape and is composed of various layers, including a core, mantle, and crust.  Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and supporting life.\n\n* **Sun:** The star at the center of our solar system.  It's a massive ball of hot gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, that generates energy through nuclear fusion.  The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets in orbit.\n\n* **Axis:** An imaginary line running through the center of a rotating object, such as the Earth. Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt is responsible for the seasons.\n\n* **Revolution:** The movement of one celestial body around another. Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, taking approximately 365.25 days to complete one revolution.\n\n* **Rotation:** The spinning of a celestial body on its axis.  Earth rotates on its axis, causing the cycle of day and night.  One rotation takes approximately 24 hours.\n\n* **Seasons:**  The four periods of the year (spring, summer, autumn, winter) characterized by changes in temperature, daylight hours, and weather patterns.

While the river flows between the Vindhyas and Satpuras mountain ranges, this is a consequence of the rift valley's location rather than the primary cause of its westward flow.\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **Narmada River:** A major river in central India, flowing westward into the Arabian Sea.  Its unique westward flow distinguishes it from most other peninsular rivers.\n\n* **Vindhyas:** A mountain range in central India, forming a significant geographical boundary.  They run roughly east-west and influence the drainage patterns of the region.\n\n* **Satpuras:** Another mountain range in central India, running roughly parallel to the Vindhyas, influencing the course of the Narmada River.  They are lower than the Vindhyas.\n\n* **Peninsular rivers:** Rivers originating in the Deccan Plateau of India, generally flowing eastward due to the slope of the land.  Examples include the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri.\n\n* **Linear rift valley:** A long, narrow valley formed by the subsidence of the Earth's crust along a linear zone. This geological feature plays a key role in the Narmada River's westward flow.\n"

Geothermal energy (2) causes volcanic eruptions and geysers, altering landscapes. Gravitational force (3) shapes landforms through erosion and sedimentation. Plate movements (4) are responsible for earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain building. The rotation of the Earth (5) causes day and night, influencing temperature variations and weather patterns. The revolution of the Earth (6) around the sun causes seasons, affecting climate and ecosystems.  All six factors contribute to dynamic changes on Earth's surface.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation:  Electromagnetic radiation encompasses a wide spectrum of energy, including visible light, ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation, and more. It plays a vital role in driving weather systems and influencing Earth's climate through processes like heating the atmosphere and oceans.\n\nGeothermal energy: Geothermal energy is heat from the Earth's interior. This heat drives plate tectonics and volcanic activity, resulting in significant changes to the Earth's surface through lava flows, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of new land.\n\nGravitational force:  Gravity is the fundamental force of attraction between objects with mass. On Earth, it's responsible for shaping landforms through processes like erosion (the wearing away of land by natural forces), and sedimentation (the deposition of eroded material).\n\nPlate movements: Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The movement of these plates causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains and ocean basins.\n\nRotation of the Earth: The Earth's rotation on its axis causes the daily cycle of day and night. This rotation significantly affects temperature variations across the globe, influencing weather patterns and wind systems.\n\nRevolution of the Earth: The Earth's revolution around the sun causes the seasonal changes experienced throughout the year. These seasonal variations influence temperature, precipitation, and the growth cycles of plants and animals.\n\nCFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons): CFCs are synthetic organic compounds that were widely used in refrigerants, aerosols, and other applications. They are now known to deplete the ozone layer, resulting in increased exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation.\n\nIPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): The IPCC is a UN body that assesses the science related to climate change.  Its reports provide comprehensive assessments of the state of climate science, informing policymakers and the public.\n\nGlobal Warming: Global warming refers to the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.  The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It includes both global warming and its effects, such as sea level rise; ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica, the Himalayas, and the Arctic; and changes in rainfall patterns.\n\nGHGs (Greenhouse Gases): Greenhouse gases are gases in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat.  Examples include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).  Increased concentrations of these gases contribute to global warming.\n\nGWP (Global Warming Potential): GWP is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere over a specific time period, relative to carbon dioxide.  It helps to compare the relative warming effects of different gases.\n\nOzone Depletion: Ozone depletion refers to the reduction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The ozone layer protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.  CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances have caused significant thinning of this layer.\n"

The Preamble sets out the goals and objectives of the Constitution, including justice\u2014social, economic, and political\u2014but doesn't provide mechanisms for achieving it. Fundamental Rights guarantee individual liberties and freedoms, while DPSPs outline the social and economic goals the state should strive for.  Therefore, 'Economic Justice' as a constitutional objective is found in the Preamble (aspirational goal) and the DPSP (mechanism for achieving the goal).\n\n\nPreamble: The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is a brief introductory statement that sets out the goals and objectives of the Constitution. It declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.  It was adopted on November 26, 1949.\n\nFundamental Rights: Part III of the Indian Constitution lists the Fundamental Rights, which are basic human rights guaranteed to all citizens.  These rights are enforceable by courts and protect citizens from state action that violates their fundamental freedoms.  They include the right to equality, freedom, against exploitation, freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, and the right to constitutional remedies.\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy: Part IV of the Indian Constitution contains the Directive Principles of State Policy, which are guidelines for the state to follow when making laws and policies. These principles aim to promote social and economic welfare.  They are not legally enforceable but serve as guidelines for the government to work towards a just society.  They include provisions relating to economic justice, social security, and equal pay for equal work.\n\nDirect Democracy: A form of democracy in which people decide policy initiatives directly.  This contrasts with representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.  Examples of direct democracy mechanisms include referendums, initiatives, recalls, and plebiscites.  Switzerland is often cited as a country with a strong tradition of direct democracy.\n\nDistributive Justice: A concept of fairness in the distribution of resources and opportunities within a society. It's often seen as encompassing both social and economic justice, ensuring that benefits and burdens are distributed equitably.  The ideal of distributive justice, especially concerning the equitable distribution of wealth and resources, has historical roots in various social and political movements, including the Russian Revolution.\n\nSovereignty: The supreme authority within a territory.  A sovereign nation is independent and free to govern itself without external interference.  The Indian Constitution establishes India as a sovereign nation, meaning it is not subject to the control of any other nation.\n\nLiberty: The state of being free from external constraints or restrictions.  The Indian Constitution guarantees various freedoms, including freedom of speech, expression, assembly, and religion.\n\nEquality: The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities.  The Indian Constitution aims to ensure equality before the law and equal opportunity for all citizens, regardless of caste, creed, religion, or gender.\n\nFraternity: A sense of brotherhood and solidarity among the citizens of a nation. The Indian Constitution promotes fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.\n\nBerubari Union Case: A 1960 case in which the Supreme Court of India held that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution and therefore cannot be used to interpret the Constitution's provisions.\n\nKesavananda Bharati Case: A landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that established the \"basic structure doctrine,\" which limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Court ruled that certain fundamental features of the Constitution are immutable and cannot be altered, even through constitutional amendments.\n"

These gases react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then fall to the ground as rain, snow, fog, or dry particles.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change but is not a primary cause of acid rain.  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion, also not directly involved in acid rain formation. Ozone (O3) is a component of smog and a respiratory irritant, but its role in acid rain is less significant compared to SO2 and NOx.  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas with a minor contribution to acid rain.  Therefore, the combination of nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide is the most accurate answer among the given options.\n"

While it involves a cessation of suffering and a state of peace (option c), it's not simply \"bliss and rest\" but rather the extinguishing of the cycle of suffering caused by craving and attachment.  Option (b) is incorrect because while the concept of self is challenged in Buddhism,  it's not necessarily a complete annihilation.

He left his princely life to seek enlightenment, achieving it at the age of 35 and subsequently spreading his teachings.  His teachings focused on the cessation of suffering through the Eightfold Path. His death at Kusinagara, around 483 BC, marked the beginning of the spread of Buddhism.\n\nNirvana:  The ultimate goal in Buddhism, a state of liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. It is achieved by extinguishing craving and attachment.  Various interpretations exist, but the core concept is freedom from suffering.\n\nBrahmin:  A member of the highest caste in the Hindu social hierarchy, traditionally associated with priestly duties.  The Buddha's teachings challenged the Brahminical authority and their interpretations of religious practices.\n\nShakya:  The clan to which the Buddha belonged.  Siddhartha Gautama was a prince of the Shakya clan.\n\nKapilavastu:  The ancient city where Siddhartha Gautama spent his early life as a prince.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: All three statements are applicable to Jain doctrine.\n\n1. **Penance and Karma annihilation:** Jainism emphasizes penance (tapas) as a crucial practice to reduce and ultimately annihilate karma.  Karma, in Jainism, is not simply a consequence of actions but a substance that clings to the soul, hindering its liberation.  Penance, through rigorous self-discipline and austerity, helps to shed this karmic burden.\n\n2. **Animism (Every object has a soul):**  Jainism is an animistic religion, believing that every object, no matter how small, possesses a soul (jiva).  This principle of Anekantavada (many-sidedness) emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the inherent value of all life.\n\n3. **Karma as the bane of the soul:**  Jain philosophy views karma as the primary obstacle to liberation (moksha).  The cycle of birth and death (samsara) is driven by the accumulation of karma.  The ultimate goal of Jain practice is to purify the soul by eliminating karma, leading to liberation from this cycle.\n\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **Mahavira:** The 24th and last Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) of Jainism, considered the founder of Jainism in its present form. He emphasized non-violence (ahimsa) and rigorous asceticism as paths to liberation.  His teachings are central to Jain philosophy and practice.\n\n* **Karma:** In Jainism, karma is not simply a consequence of actions but a subtle substance that attaches to the soul, causing suffering and rebirth. It is seen as the primary obstacle to liberation.\n\n* **Moksha (Liberation):** The ultimate goal in Jainism, the complete liberation of the soul from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) by shedding all karmic bonds.\n\n* **Svetambara and Digambara:** The two major sects of Jainism, differing primarily in their views on monastic practices, especially regarding the wearing of clothes.  Svetambaras wear white clothes, while Digambaras traditionally go naked.\n\n* **Penance (Tapas):**  A crucial practice in Jainism involving rigorous self-discipline, austerity, and self-mortification aimed at reducing and eliminating karmic accumulation.  Various forms of tapas exist, ranging from fasting to extreme physical endurance.\n\n* **Ahimsa (Non-violence):**  The core principle of Jainism, emphasizing the avoidance of harm to all living beings, extending to even the smallest organisms.  It guides all aspects of Jain life, from diet to occupation.\n\n* **Anekantavada (Many-sidedness):** A core Jain principle emphasizing that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives. It encourages a tolerance of diverse viewpoints and a rejection of absolutist claims.\n\n\n"

Land heats up and cools down much faster than water. During the day, land surfaces absorb solar radiation quickly, leading to higher temperatures. At night, land loses heat rapidly, resulting in lower temperatures. Water, on the other hand, heats and cools slowly, moderating temperature fluctuations. This creates a larger temperature difference between day and night and between summer and winter in continental interiors. While altitude (option 2) can influence temperature, it's not the primary reason for the contrast between continental interiors and coasts. Strong winds (option 3) can affect local temperatures but don't explain the overall difference. Rainfall amounts (option 4) are not directly linked to the annual temperature range.  Therefore, only option 1 is the most significant factor.\n"

The provided text states that Indian coal is bituminous, meaning it has undergone a moderate degree of metamorphism. Bituminous coal typically has a high ash content and a relatively low ash fusion temperature.  While the text mentions India lacks sulfur minerals, implying a low sulfur content in some minerals, it doesn't explicitly state this is true for all Indian coal. Therefore, only characteristics 1 and 3 are definitively supported by the given information.\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Indian Coal:** Coal found in India, primarily bituminous, characterized by high ash content and low ash fusion temperature.  Significant reserves exist in various regions like the Gondwana formations.  Lacks anthracite coal.\n\n* **Ash Content:** The percentage of non-combustible mineral matter in coal. High ash content reduces the coal's heating value and can cause operational problems in power plants.\n\n* **Sulfur Content:** The amount of sulfur present in coal. High sulfur content contributes to air pollution (acid rain) when burned.\n\n* **Ash Fusion Temperature:** The temperature at which the ash in coal starts to melt and fuse together.  A low ash fusion temperature can lead to slagging and fouling in power plants.\n\n* **Bituminous Coal:** A type of coal that is intermediate in rank between lignite and anthracite. It has a relatively high carbon content and is widely used as a fuel.\n\n* **Gondwana Formation:** A geological formation in India containing significant coal deposits.

Thermal power plants, especially coal-based ones, are significant consumers of water for cooling purposes. While the other options (textiles, paper and pulp, and engineering) also use water, the scale of water consumption in thermal power generation is considerably larger in India given its reliance on coal-fired plants.\n\nThe text provides information on various industries:\n\n* **Textiles:** This industry encompasses cotton, jute, silk, wool, and synthetic textiles.  Different regions of India specialize in different types of textiles (e.g., cotton in Mumbai, Ahmedabad; jute in Calcutta; wool in Punjab).  Water is used in various stages of textile production, including cleaning, dyeing, and finishing.\n\n* **Paper and pulp:** The paper industry uses wood pulp, bamboo, sabai grass, sugarcane bagasse, and recycled materials.  Significant water is required for pulping, papermaking, and cleaning processes. Major paper producing states include Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and Maharashtra.\n\n* **Engineering:**  The text mentions Hindustan Machine Tools, a Bangalore-based engineering company.  While engineering industries consume water, the scale is likely less compared to power generation or other water-intensive industries like textiles and paper.\n\n* **Thermal power:** As noted earlier, thermal power plants, especially coal-fired plants, are heavy water consumers for cooling systems.

An increase in the money supply (1) leads to more money chasing the same amount of goods, driving up prices. A decrease in the aggregate level of output (2) means fewer goods are available, increasing their relative scarcity and price. An increase in effective demand (3) signifies a surge in consumer spending and investment, exceeding the economy's capacity to produce, thus fueling inflationary pressure. Therefore, all three factors (1, 2, and 3) can contribute to a rise in the general price level.\n\n\nMoney supply: The total amount of money in circulation in an economy at a given time. It includes currency in circulation, demand deposits, and other liquid assets.  Changes in the money supply directly impact inflation.\n\nAggregate level of output: The total quantity of goods and services produced in an economy during a specific period.  A decrease in output can lead to cost-push inflation.\n\nEffective demand: The total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given price level, comprising consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports.  An increase in effective demand can lead to demand-pull inflation.\n\nCPI (Consumer Price Index): A measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  It's a key indicator of inflation.\n\nWPI (Wholesale Price Index): A measure of the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output. It's another indicator of inflation, often preceding changes in CPI.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product): The total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.\n\nGVA (Gross Value Added): A measure of the value of goods and services produced in an economy, net of the value of intermediate goods and services used in the production process.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation:Creating new money to finance a budget deficit (monetization of deficit) is the most inflationary option.  When a government creates new money, it increases the money supply without a corresponding increase in the production of goods and services. This leads to an increase in demand without a sufficient increase in supply, causing prices to rise \u2013 inflation.\n\nRepaying public debt reduces the money supply, having a deflationary effect. Borrowing from the public or banks to finance a deficit increases demand for loanable funds, potentially increasing interest rates but doesn't directly inject new money into the economy to the same extent as creating new money.  Therefore, it's less inflationary than option (d).\n\nA short note on the named entities:\n\n* **Inflation:** A general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.  When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money \u2013 a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.\n* **Public debt:** The total amount of money that a government owes to its creditors. This includes debt held by individuals, corporations, and other governments.\n* **Budget deficit:** The difference between a government's spending and its revenue in a given period.  If a government spends more than it earns in taxes and other revenue, it runs a budget deficit.\n* **Monetization of deficit:** The process by which a government finances its budget deficit by creating new money. This is typically done by the central bank purchasing government bonds.  It can lead to significant inflation if not managed carefully.\n* **Consumer Price Index (CPI):** A measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  It's a key indicator of inflation.\n* **Wholesale Price Index (WPI):** A measure of the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output. It's another measure of inflation, but it focuses on wholesale prices rather than consumer prices.  It often precedes changes in CPI.\n* **Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** India's central bank responsible for monetary policy, managing the country's foreign exchange reserves, and regulating the banking system.  Its actions significantly influence inflation.\n* **Fiscal policy:** Government policy relating to revenue, expenditure and debt management.  It has a significant impact on inflation.\n* **Monetary policy:** Actions undertaken by a central bank to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or restrain economic activity.

This is not a trick of the eye in the sense that the perception is based on a real phenomenon \u2013 the bending of light \u2013 but it is a misrepresentation of the sun's actual size.\n\n2. **Colour of the sun at dawn:** The sun appears reddish at dawn and dusk because of Rayleigh scattering.  Shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are scattered more by the atmosphere than longer wavelengths (red), leading to the reddish hue. Again, this is a real atmospheric effect that alters our perception of the sun's color.\n\n3. **Moon being visible at dawn:** The moon's visibility at dawn is not an illusion; it's a matter of its position relative to the sun and Earth.  It's simply a matter of celestial mechanics and not a perceptual trick.\n\n4. **Twinkle of stars:** Stars twinkle due to atmospheric turbulence. Light from stars bends as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, causing the apparent twinkling effect. This is a real atmospheric effect that affects our perception.\n\n5. **Polestar being visible:** The visibility of the Polestar (Polaris) is not an illusion; it's a result of its location near the celestial north pole. Its visibility depends on the observer's location and atmospheric conditions, but it's not an optical illusion.\n\nTherefore, only 1 and 2 can be considered optical illusions in the sense that they are misrepresentations of the sun's size and color due to real atmospheric effects.

When sunlight enters a raindrop, it is refracted (bent) and dispersed into its constituent colors.  Different colors of light have different wavelengths, and are refracted at slightly different angles.\n\n2. **Refraction:**  The bending of light as it passes from one medium (air) to another (water) is called refraction. This occurs twice in a raindrop: once when light enters and again when it exits.\n\n3. **Internal reflection:**  After the first refraction, the light undergoes internal reflection within the raindrop before exiting. This reflection further separates the colors and intensifies the effect.\n\nThe combination of these three processes separates the white sunlight into its constituent colors, resulting in a rainbow.\n\n\n**Short Notes on Important Keywords and Named Entities:**\n\n* **Dispersion:** The separation of white light into its constituent colors (spectrum) due to differences in their wavelengths.  This is observed when light passes through a prism or raindrops.\n\n* **Refraction:** The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index.

This happens when light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium.\n\n* **Sunlight:** Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun, composed primarily of visible light, infrared radiation, and ultraviolet radiation.  It is essential for photosynthesis and many other processes on Earth.\n\n* **Raindrops:** Droplets of water condensed from atmospheric water vapor. Their spherical shape and refractive properties are crucial for rainbow formation.\n\n\n"

The other options are less likely to be the primary cause of failure.  While unfavorable soil minerals (a) can impact growth, it's not the most common reason for failure immediately after transplanting. Root hairs gripping the soil too hard (b) is not a typical problem. Leaf damage (d) during transplantation can certainly stress the seedling, but root hair loss is generally a more significant factor affecting immediate survival.\n"

        "year": 2013,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (c)\nexplanation: Economic growth in country X doesn't *necessarily* occur due to (a) world technical progress, (b) population growth in X, or (d) world trade growth.  These factors can influence growth, but aren't guaranteed to lead to it.  Capital formation in X (c), however, is a necessary condition.  Capital formation refers to the increase in the stock of capital goods (machinery, equipment, infrastructure) within an economy.  An increase in capital goods directly contributes to increased productivity and output, which is the definition of economic growth.  Population growth without investment in capital can lead to lower per capita income.  Technological progress globally might not benefit country X if it doesn't adopt or adapt the technology. Similarly, increased global trade doesn't guarantee growth for country X if it doesn't participate or benefit from it.\n\nShort notes on important keywords and named entities:\n\n**Economic Growth:**  An increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is usually measured by changes in real gross domestic product (GDP).  Higher economic growth often leads to improved living standards, but it's not a perfect measure of overall well-being.\n\n**Technical Progress:** Advances in technology and knowledge that improve the efficiency of production. This can lead to higher output with the same or fewer inputs. Technical progress is a key driver of long-term economic growth.\n\n**Population Growth:** An increase in the number of people in a country or region. While it can increase the labor force and potentially boost economic activity, it also places demands on resources and infrastructure.  Rapid population growth without corresponding economic development can lead to poverty.\n\n**Capital Formation:** The process of creating and accumulating capital goods, including machinery, equipment, and infrastructure. It is crucial for economic growth as it enhances productivity.  Insufficient capital formation can hinder economic advancement.\n\n**Volume of Trade:** The total value or quantity of goods and services exchanged in international trade.  Higher trade volume can stimulate economic activity but is not a guarantee of economic growth for any single country.  A country might experience a trade deficit despite increased global trade.\n\n**Country X:** A hypothetical country used in the question to illustrate the relationship between different economic factors and growth.  The characteristics of Country X are not specified, making it a generic representation of an economy.\n\n"

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they rely entirely on the host cell's machinery for replication and metabolism. They lack the necessary enzymes and organelles for energy production (like mitochondria).\n\n2. **Viruses can be cultured in any synthetic medium:** This statement is incorrect. Viruses require living host cells to replicate.  They cannot be grown in artificial media alone because they lack the metabolic capabilities to synthesize the components they need for reproduction.\n\n3. **Viruses are transmitted from one organism to another by biological vectors only:** This statement is incorrect. While biological vectors (like mosquitoes for Zika virus) play a crucial role in the transmission of some viruses, many viruses are transmitted through various routes, including direct contact (e.g., influenza), respiratory droplets (e.g., COVID-19), fecal-oral routes (e.g., rotavirus), and contaminated objects (e.g., norovirus).\n\nTherefore, only statement 1 is correct.\n"
