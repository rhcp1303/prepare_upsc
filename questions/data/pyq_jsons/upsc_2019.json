        "year": 2019,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\n\nexplanation:Statement 1 is largely correct. Jagirdars received land assignments (jagirs) in exchange for military and administrative services, including judicial and police duties.  Zamindars, on the other hand, primarily held revenue rights, their main obligation being the collection of revenue for the Mughal state.  While some Zamindars might have had other responsibilities, it wasn't a defining feature of their position in the same way it was for Jagirdars.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the heritability of jagirs varied depending on the grant's terms and the ruler's whims, it was often hereditary.  Similarly, Zamindari rights could also be hereditary, although the degree of heritability varied across regions and time periods.  The Mughal system was complex, and the extent of heritability for both positions wasn't uniformly defined.\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Jagirdar:** A landholder in Mughal India who received a jagir (land assignment) in exchange for military service, administrative duties (including judicial and police functions), and revenue collection responsibilities. The size and duration of the jagir varied depending on the Jagirdar's rank and the ruler's favor.  Heritability wasn't always guaranteed.\n\n* **Zamindar:**  A landholder in Mughal India primarily responsible for collecting revenue from the peasants on behalf of the state.  While some Zamindars might have had additional administrative or judicial responsibilities, their primary function was revenue collection.  The extent of their power and the heritability of their rights were not uniform throughout the empire.\n\n* **Mansabdari system:** A unique system of military and administrative organization employed by the Mughal emperors. It involved assigning ranks (mansabs) to officials based on a dual ranking system (zat and sawar) that determined their salary, military responsibilities, and social status.  It played a crucial role in the administration and military of the Mughal Empire.\n\n* **Zat:**  One component of the dual ranking system in the Mughal Mansabdari system. It represented the personal rank of a mansabdar, indicating their social standing and status. It determined the official's salary and social standing.\n\n* **Sawar:** The second component of the dual ranking system in the Mughal Mansabdari system.  It represented the number of cavalrymen a mansabdar was expected to maintain. It showed the military capacity of the mansabdar.\n\n* **Akbar:** The third Mughal emperor, known for his administrative reforms, religious tolerance, and expansion of the empire. His reign is considered a golden age in Mughal history. His administrative and military reforms were significant.\n\n* **Aurangzeb:** The sixth Mughal emperor, known for his religious conservatism and expansionist policies. His reign marked a shift toward greater religious intolerance and the decline of the Mughal Empire.  His policies had significant negative consequences.\n\n* **Jahangir:** The fourth Mughal emperor, known for his patronage of arts and culture, and his relatively peaceful reign compared to some of his predecessors and successors. His reign saw some modifications in the Mansabdari system.\n\n\n"

        "subject": "modern_indian_history",
        "year": 2019,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (a)\n\nexplanation:The ceiling laws in India were designed to limit the maximum amount of land that an individual *family* could own.  The aim was to redistribute surplus land to landless farmers and reduce land concentration. Option (b) is incorrect because while providing land to the landless was a goal, it wasn't the *major* aim;  redistributing surplus land was equally, if not more, important. Option (c) is wrong because land reforms didn't predominantly shift cultivation towards cash crops. Option (d) is false because there were exemptions granted under the ceiling laws, often due to political influence or loopholes in implementation.  The Zamindari system, Mahalwari system, and Ryotwari system were pre-independence land revenue systems that the reforms aimed to dismantle.  The Bhoodan and Gramdan movement represented a non-violent approach to land redistribution.  The Naxalite movement, conversely, employed more forceful methods.  Telangana witnessed both communal legal and Naxalite movements related to land reforms. West Bengal and Kerala saw significant peasant mobilization for land rights.  Article 39 of the Indian Constitution guided land reform policy by emphasizing equitable distribution of resources.  The implementation of ceiling laws, however, faced significant challenges due to political resistance and loopholes.  Despite aims to distribute land to the landless, the actual redistribution was far less successful than intended.\n"

Statement 1 is correct: it ended the Company's monopoly on trade in India, except for tea and trade with China.  Statement 2 is incorrect: the Act did not explicitly assert the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Company's territories. While it increased British parliamentary control, it didn't directly transfer sovereignty. Statement 3 is correct: the Act increased parliamentary oversight of Indian revenues, giving the British Parliament more control over the Company's financial dealings. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.\n\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **Charter Act of 1813:** This Act marked a significant shift in British control over India, curtailing the East India Company's trade monopoly and increasing parliamentary oversight of its affairs.  It laid the groundwork for greater British influence over Indian governance and finances.\n\n* **East India Company (EIC):**  A powerful British trading company that held significant political and economic power in India from the 17th to the 19th centuries.

The Charter Act of 1813 enhanced the Parliament's influence over the East India Company's actions in India, particularly regarding financial matters.\n\n* **Revolt of 1857 (Sepoy Mutiny):** A major uprising against British rule in India. The aftermath of this revolt led to significant changes in the governance of India, including the abolishment of the East India Company's rule.\n\n* **Act for the Good Government of India:** This is another name for the Charter Act of 1813, reflecting its intent to improve the administration of India under British control.\n\n* **Abolition of EIC:** The East India Company's political power was abolished in 1858 following the Sepoy Mutiny, with the British Crown taking direct control of India's governance.  The Company continued to exist as a commercial entity for a short time after.\n\n* **Lord Warren Hastings:** The first Governor-General of Bengal, who played a crucial role in establishing British administrative control in India.\n\n* **Lord William Bentinck:**  Governor-General of India, instrumental in implementing social reforms and administrative changes during his tenure.\n\n* **Macaulay Committee:** A committee formed in 1854 to reform the civil service examination system in India, opening opportunities for Indians.\n\n\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: Satellite images and remote sensing data are used for measuring chlorophyll content in vegetation, estimating greenhouse gas emissions (though it might require additional data sources for precise quantification), and determining land surface temperatures.  Chlorophyll content is assessed using spectral reflectance properties of vegetation in satellite imagery. Land surface temperatures are directly measured by thermal infrared sensors on satellites.  Greenhouse gas emissions from localized sources like rice paddies are challenging to measure solely through satellite data due to the need for high spatial resolution and atmospheric correction techniques. While satellites can detect some indicators related to rice paddy emissions (e.g., methane plumes under specific conditions), ground-based measurements are typically required for accurate estimation. Therefore, options 1 and 3 are directly measurable, while option 2 requires a combination of satellite and ground-based data.\n\n\nShort notes on important keywords and named entities:\n\n* **Satellite images/remote sensing data:** Technology using satellites to capture images and data of Earth's surface. Various sensors measure different properties like light reflectance (for vegetation), thermal radiation (for temperature), and gaseous emissions.  Applications are diverse, covering environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and more.\n\n* **Chlorophyll content:** The amount of chlorophyll, a green pigment in plants essential for photosynthesis, present in vegetation. Chlorophyll levels indicate plant health and productivity, which are crucial factors in assessing vegetation health and carbon sequestration.\n\n* **Greenhouse gas emissions:** The release of gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to global warming and climate change.  Sources include industrial processes, agriculture, transportation, and natural sources.\n\n* **Rice paddies:** Flooded fields where rice is cultivated. They are significant sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, due to anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the waterlogged soil.\n\n* **Land surface temperatures:** The temperature of Earth's surface.  It's influenced by various factors, including solar radiation, atmospheric conditions, and land cover.  Land surface temperature data is vital for understanding weather patterns, climate change impacts, and ecosystem dynamics.\n\n* **IPCC-UN's IPCC:** The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body assessing the science related to climate change. Their reports synthesize scientific findings to inform policymakers and the public about climate change risks and mitigation strategies.\n\n"

Global warming could increase ocean temperatures and destabilize these hydrates, leading to the release of large amounts of methane into the atmosphere.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing significantly to global warming.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Significant deposits of methane hydrate are found in permafrost regions like the Arctic tundra and beneath the ocean floor in continental margins and deep-sea sediments. These areas provide the low temperatures and high pressures necessary for the formation of methane hydrates.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Atmospheric methane has a shorter lifespan than carbon dioxide.  It oxidizes relatively quickly in the atmosphere, typically within a decade or two, forming carbon dioxide and water vapor.  While this oxidation process removes methane, it converts it into another greenhouse gas (CO2), albeit one with a lower global warming potential per molecule than methane.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are correct.  Methane hydrate is a type of clathrate, a crystalline structure where a gas is trapped within a lattice of water molecules, making it a potential source of energy.

The 44th Amendment did not introduce an article placing the election of the Prime Minister beyond judicial review.  While the 44th Amendment made changes related to the Prime Minister's office and the relationship between the executive and legislature, it did not explicitly remove the possibility of judicial review concerning the Prime Minister's election.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court did strike down a part of the 99th Amendment to the Constitution.  The Supreme Court deemed this portion of the amendment to be inconsistent with the independence of the judiciary.  The specific details of the case and the part of the amendment struck down would require further research beyond this provided context.\n\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **44th Amendment to the Constitution of India:** This amendment, enacted in 1978, introduced several changes to the Constitution, primarily aimed at limiting the power of the executive and strengthening democratic institutions.  Significant changes included modifying the definition of \"Money Bill,\" impacting the relationship between Parliament and the executive.\n\n* **99th Amendment to the Constitution of India:** This amendment, enacted in 2014, dealt with the appointment of judges to the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).  The Supreme Court challenged the amendment's effect on judicial independence.\n\n* **Supreme Court of India:** The highest court of appeal in India, responsible for interpreting the Constitution and ensuring its enforcement. It has the power of judicial review, enabling it to examine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\n* **Judicial Review:** The power of the judiciary to review laws passed by the legislature and actions taken by the executive to determine their compatibility with the Constitution. It is a cornerstone of a constitutional democracy.\n\n* **Independence of Judiciary:** The principle that the judiciary should be free from interference from the executive or legislature, enabling it to act impartially in upholding the law and protecting the rights of citizens.  This independence is vital for the rule of law.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\n\nexplanation:The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) employ various measures to stabilize the Indian rupee.  Curbing non-essential imports and boosting exports increases the demand for rupees, strengthening its value.  Encouraging Masala Bonds, rupee-denominated bonds issued by Indian borrowers to overseas investors, brings in foreign currency, supporting the rupee. Easing external commercial borrowing regulations makes it easier for Indian entities to access foreign currency, indirectly supporting the rupee.\n\nHowever, an expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing the money supply, would likely weaken the rupee.  An expansionary policy lowers interest rates, making the currency less attractive to foreign investors and potentially increasing imports, thus putting downward pressure on the rupee's value.  Therefore, an expansionary monetary policy is the least likely measure to stop the rupee's decline.\n\n\nShort notes on important keywords and named entities:\n\n* **Indian Rupee:** The official currency of India.  Its value fluctuates based on various economic factors, including international trade, foreign investment, and domestic monetary policy.\n\n* **Government/RBI:** The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India are the primary authorities responsible for managing the country's monetary policy and exchange rate.  They work together to maintain macroeconomic stability.\n\n* **Masala Bonds:** Rupee-denominated bonds issued in international markets by Indian entities. They attract foreign investment and increase the demand for rupees.\n\n* **External Commercial Borrowing:**  Loans raised by Indian entities from foreign lenders.  Government regulations influence the ease of accessing these loans, which affect the supply of foreign currency in the country.\n\n* **Expansionary Monetary Policy:** A policy implemented by the RBI to increase the money supply, typically by lowering interest rates.  This can stimulate economic growth but may also lead to inflation and currency devaluation.\n"
