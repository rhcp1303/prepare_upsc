They are not typically used in lubricants, although some specialized lubricants might contain them.  Therefore, HFCs are used in three of the listed applications.\n\nAerosols:  Aerosols are colloidal systems containing small solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas.  HFCs are used as propellants in some aerosol products because they have low toxicity and do not deplete the ozone layer.\n\nFoam agents:  Foam agents create stable foams often used in fire suppression or other applications.  HFCs can be used as blowing agents to create the foam structure.\n\nFire retardants:  Fire retardants suppress or slow the spread of fire.  Some fire retardants utilize HFCs to help suppress combustion.\n\nLubricants: Lubricants reduce friction between moving parts. While HFCs have some properties that might seem suitable for lubrication, they are not commonly used as primary lubricants.  They might be present as minor components in some specialized applications.\n"

When the RBI sells foreign currency, it receives rupees, potentially increasing domestic liquidity. Sterilization involves offsetting this increase through actions like open market operations (OMOs).  Option (a), conducting OMOs, is the correct answer because the buying and selling of government securities in the open market is a key tool used by the RBI for sterilization.\n\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs):  The RBI's buying or selling of government securities to influence money supply and interest rates.  Buying securities injects liquidity, while selling withdraws it.\n\nOversight of settlement and payment systems:  The RBI's role in ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of payment systems like RTGS and NEFT.

It ensures that legal proceedings are fair and impartial, respecting fundamental rights and principles of justice. While it incorporates elements of natural justice (fairness and impartiality) and the procedure established by law, its core meaning lies in the equitable treatment of individuals under the law.  Equality before the law is a related but distinct concept, focusing on the absence of special privileges and equal subjection to the law, whereas due process emphasizes the fairness of the *application* of the law.\n\nNatural justice:  A set of principles ensuring fairness in legal proceedings, including the right to be heard and a fair trial.  It emphasizes impartiality and the avoidance of bias.\n\nProcedure established by law:  The legal processes and steps followed in the application of a law.  Due process requires that these procedures are fair and reasonable.\n\nFair application of law:  The equitable and impartial application of the law to all individuals, ensuring that no one is unfairly disadvantaged or discriminated against.  This is the core of due process.\n\nEquality before the law: The principle that all individuals are subject to the same laws and are treated equally under the law, without any special privileges or exemptions.\n\nRule of law:  A principle of governance where all individuals and authorities are accountable under the law.  It ensures justice, protects democratic values, and prevents arbitrary use of power.  The rule of law is essential for due process to function effectively.\n\nArticle 14 (Equality before the law): This article of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.  It prohibits discrimination based on factors such as religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.\n\nArticle 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty): This article guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. This is often interpreted to include the right to due process.\n\nVeroparan case (1950): This case dealt with the interpretation of Article 21 and the scope of due process in India.  It clarified the limitations of challenging the validity of a law based solely on its reasonableness or fairness.\n\nMenaka Gandhi case (1978): This landmark case significantly expanded the interpretation of Article 21 to include various facets of life and personal liberty beyond mere physical freedom, including the right to livelihood, privacy, and a healthy environment.

While a constitution may influence law-making objectives (a), enable government creation (b), and aim for social improvements (d), its core function is establishing a framework that constrains governmental authority to prevent tyranny and protect citizens' rights.  The provided text extensively details the Indian Constitution's functions, emphasizing the importance of limiting government power and protecting fundamental rights as central to its purpose.\n\nA constitution is a body of fundamental principles that determine how a state is organized and governed. It allocates power, defines rights, and sets limits on government authority.  The Indian Constitution, a prime example, goes beyond basic rules to reflect societal aspirations and goals.  A bill of rights is a list of fundamental rights protected by a constitution, such as those in the Indian and South African Constitutions.  The Indian Constitution\u2019s fundamental rights include equality, freedom, and protection against exploitation.  Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable guidelines for government action.  The Preamble summarizes the Constitution's goals.  The Constituent Assembly drafted the Indian Constitution.  First Past the Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) are different electoral systems.  The Election Commission of India is an independent body that conducts elections.  Preventive detention is the lawful imprisonment of a person to prevent future criminal activity.  Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws. Public Interest Litigation (PIL) allows individuals or groups to bring cases to court on behalf of the public interest.  Federalism is a system of government that divides power between a central government and regional governments.  The Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the Indian Parliament, representing the states.  The Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Indian Parliament, directly elected by the people.  The basic structure doctrine limits the amending power of the Parliament.\n```\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (b)\n\nexplanation: The 42nd Amendment is widely believed to have been enacted to overcome certain judicial interpretations of Fundamental Rights, particularly those related to the limits of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) established the \"basic structure\" doctrine, limiting Parliament's amending power. The 42nd Amendment, enacted in 1976, attempted to curtail this limitation, but was later partially overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe 1st Amendment addressed concerns regarding the interpretation of fundamental rights, but it did not directly counter a significant judicial interpretation in the same way the 42nd Amendment did. The 44th and 86th Amendments dealt with other constitutional matters and are not directly linked to overcoming judicial interpretations of Fundamental Rights in the same way the 42nd Amendment was.\n\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **1st Amendment:**  This amendment, passed soon after the adoption of the Indian Constitution, primarily aimed to clarify and restrict the scope of certain fundamental rights to prevent their misuse and to address concerns raised by the judiciary regarding their interpretation.\n\n* **42nd Amendment:** This amendment, enacted during the Emergency, made significant changes to the Constitution, including adding the words \"socialist,\" \"secular,\" and \"integrity\" to the Preamble.  A key aspect was its attempt to remove limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, a direct response to the Kesavananda Bharati case's \"basic structure\" doctrine.\n\n* **44th Amendment:** This amendment largely reversed some of the more controversial aspects of the 42nd Amendment, restoring some checks and balances to the amendment process.\n\n\n* **86th Amendment:** This amendment dealt with the right to education and is not directly related to judicial interpretations of fundamental rights.\n\n* **Kesavananda Bharati case (1973):** This landmark Supreme Court case established the doctrine of \"basic structure\" of the Constitution, limiting the power of Parliament to amend the fundamental aspects of the Constitution.  It declared that Parliament cannot alter the core features of the Constitution, even through amendments.\n\n* **Golak Nath case (1967):**  This Supreme Court case initially held that Parliament could not amend fundamental rights.  However, this decision was later overturned by the Kesavananda Bharati case.\n\n* **Shankar Prasad case (1951):** This Supreme Court case initially upheld Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights, but its interpretation was later challenged and modified by subsequent cases.\n\n* **Indira Gandhi vs Raj Narain (1975):** This case also related to the 42nd Amendment and its impact on the judiciary. It is important to note that the 42nd Amendment was largely a response to judicial pronouncements limiting the scope of amendments.\n\n* **Art. 13:** This article deals with judicial review, empowering courts to invalidate laws that violate fundamental rights.\n\n* **Art. 31A:** This article restricts the scope of fundamental rights relating to property.\n\n* **Art. 368:** This article deals with the procedure for amending the Constitution.\n"

Statement 1 is incorrect because while biofilters indirectly help manage uneaten feed by processing the resulting ammonia, they don't directly remove the feed itself.  Statement 2 is correct; nitrifying bacteria within the biofilter convert toxic ammonia (NH3) into less harmful nitrite (NO2-) and then nitrate (NO3-). Statement 3 is incorrect; biofilters don't increase phosphorus; they help remove it, although some phosphorus might be incorporated into the biomass of the filter media. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.\n\nRecirculating Aquaculture System (RAS): A closed-loop aquaculture system that recirculates water, minimizing water usage and waste discharge.  Biofilters are essential components of RAS.\n\nBiofilter: A biological filter that uses beneficial microorganisms (bacteria) to break down harmful waste products (e.g., ammonia) in aquaculture systems.  Different types of biofilters exist, each with varying media and designs to optimize microbial growth and efficiency.\n\nAmmonia (NH3): A highly toxic waste product of fish metabolism.

Water vapor, a significant component of the lower atmosphere, effectively absorbs infrared radiation. This absorption contributes to the greenhouse effect, warming the Earth's surface. Option (a) is incorrect because the amount of insolation received at the equator is significantly higher than at the poles, but not by a factor of 10. Option (b) is incorrect as visible light constitutes the largest portion of insolation. Option (d) is incorrect because infrared waves are not part of the visible spectrum; they are a type of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths.\n\nInsolation:  The amount of solar radiation received by the Earth's surface.  It varies with latitude, time of year, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nInfrared rays: A type of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths than visible light.  They are a significant component of Earth's heat balance, being emitted by the Earth's surface and absorbed by greenhouse gases.\n\nWater vapor:  A gaseous phase of water, a major component of the Earth's atmosphere.

While there is a high rate of decomposition due to high temperature and humidity (Statement-II is correct), the nutrients are quickly absorbed by the dense vegetation and are not stored in the soil.  The rapid decomposition and nutrient uptake leave the soil relatively nutrient-poor.  Therefore, Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I.\n\nTropical rain forests: These forests are characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall exceeding 200 cm annually.  The dense vegetation quickly absorbs nutrients, resulting in nutrient-poor soil despite rapid decomposition of organic matter.

This means that water requires more energy to raise its temperature by a given amount than land does.

The right to legal counsel is a crucial aspect of due process, even in preventive detention cases.\n\nStatement 3:  The Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002,  was controversial and its provisions were debated extensively.  While POTA aimed to address terrorism, it did *not* automatically exclude confessions made to the police as evidence.

It is a controversial provision, often used in cases of political conflict between the center and state.\n\n* **Article 19:** Article 19 of the Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights relating to freedoms of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.  These freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\n* **Article 20:** This article protects against ex post facto laws (laws that make something illegal after the act occurred), double jeopardy (being tried twice for the same crime), and self-incrimination.

The value of each MLA's vote is not directly proportional to the number of elective Assembly seats in their state.  The value is determined by a formula that considers the state's population and the number of elected members in its Legislative Assembly.
