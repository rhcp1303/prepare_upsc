This is a key aspect of the RBI's structure, highlighting the government's ultimate authority over the central bank.\n\n2. **Government's Power to Issue Directions:**  The Indian Constitution allows the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest. This provision ensures that the RBI's actions align with broader national economic goals and priorities.  The government's power is not absolute, however, and it must be exercised responsibly.\n\n3. **RBI Governor's Power Source:** The RBI Governor's powers and functions are primarily derived from the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This act lays out the RBI's mandate, structure, and the Governor's specific responsibilities in managing monetary policy, regulating banks, and overseeing the financial system.\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI): The central bank of India, responsible for monetary policy, regulating banks, and maintaining financial stability.  Its independence is crucial for sound economic management, though it operates under the ultimate authority of the government.\n\nCentral Government of India: The Union Government, representing the entire nation. It holds significant power over various aspects of governance, including the appointment of key officials like the RBI Governor and the issuance of directions in the public interest.\n\nRBI Act: The primary legislation governing the Reserve Bank of India. It defines the bank's structure, functions, and powers, providing the legal framework for its operations.  Amendments to this act can significantly impact the RBI's autonomy and functions.\n\nConstitution of India: The supreme law of India, outlining the structure of the government and the distribution of powers between the central and state governments. It provides the legal basis for the government's oversight of the RBI.\n"

EPF is primarily for employees in organized sectors and eligibility depends on factors like salary and employment type.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Casual workers are not automatically entitled to regular working hours and overtime payment.  Their working conditions and payment structures often vary depending on the agreement with the employer.  Labor laws in India offer some protections, but the extent of these protections for casual workers is often limited.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The government has the power to mandate wage payments through bank accounts for specific establishments or industries, as it is a tool for enhancing transparency and accountability in wage payments.\n\n\n**Short notes on important keywords and named entities:**\n\n* **Casual workers:**  Individuals employed on a temporary or irregular basis, often without the benefits and protections afforded to regular employees.

Eligibility is subject to specific criteria.\n\n* **Overtime payment:** Compensation paid to employees for working beyond their regular working hours. Entitlement varies depending on employment type and labor laws.\n\n* **Bank account:** A financial account held by an individual or entity with a bank, used for receiving and disbursing funds.  Government initiatives often promote the use of bank accounts for wage payments to improve financial inclusion and transparency.\n"

This involves increasing government spending on public projects (like infrastructure development) to boost aggregate demand and create jobs.  Option (b) directly reflects this approach.\n\nCut in tax rates (a) is often done to encourage spending and investment, but it's usually coupled with a decrease in interest rates, not an increase. Increasing interest rates (a) would likely contract the economy further, making it less attractive for borrowing and investment. Increasing tax rates (c) and reducing government expenditure (d) are contractionary fiscal policies, which are usually avoided during a recession.  A contractionary policy is used to cool down an overheated economy, not to stimulate a weak one.\n"

A substitute good is a product or service a consumer sees as the same or similar to another product or service.\n\n2. **Price of its complement increases:** If the price of a complement good increases, the demand for the good in question will decrease. Complement goods are products or services that are used together. An increase in the price of one reduces the demand for the other.\n\n3. **Inferior good and income increases:** An inferior good is one whose demand decreases as consumer income rises. If income increases, the demand for an inferior good will fall.\n\n4. **Its price falls:** The law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\n\nTherefore, only statement 1 is correct.

UCBs are allowed to issue equity shares and preference shares. Therefore, statement 2 and 3 are correct.\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**  These are financial institutions that operate primarily in urban areas, providing banking services to their members (usually individuals or small businesses). They are cooperative societies with a unique structure and governance.  They play a significant role in providing credit and financial services, particularly to smaller businesses and individuals who may not have access to traditional banking channels.\n\n* **Banking Regulation Act, 1949:**  This is a landmark legislation in India that regulates banking activities in the country.  It aims to maintain the stability and soundness of the banking system. The Act empowers the RBI to supervise and regulate banks, including UCBs.  Amendments to the Act have broadened its scope over the years.\n\n* **Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** The central bank of India, responsible for regulating the country's financial system. Its functions include monetary policy, banking regulation and supervision, currency management, and maintaining financial stability.  The RBI plays a crucial role in overseeing the health of various financial institutions, including UCBs.\n\n* **Equity Shares:** Represent ownership in a company; shareholders have voting rights and are entitled to a share of the company's profits (dividends).\n\n* **Preference Shares:** A type of share that offers preferential treatment to shareholders, typically in terms of dividend payments and repayment of capital in case of liquidation. They usually do not carry voting rights.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation: Indian Government Bond Yields (G-Sec yields) are influenced by a multitude of factors, including both domestic and international events.\n\nActions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed): The US Fed's monetary policy actions, particularly interest rate adjustments, significantly impact global capital flows.  Increased US interest rates often attract foreign investment away from emerging markets like India, leading to decreased demand for Indian government bonds and consequently higher yields. Conversely, easing of US monetary policy can lead to lower yields.  The US Fed is the central bank of the United States, responsible for managing the nation's monetary policy and financial system stability.\n\nActions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI): The RBI, India's central bank, directly influences bond yields through its monetary policy tools.  These include open market operations (OMOs) \u2013 buying or selling government securities to manage liquidity \u2013 and changes in the repo rate (the rate at which commercial banks borrow from the RBI).  Higher repo rates generally lead to higher bond yields. The RBI's actions aim to maintain price stability and support economic growth.\n\nInflation and short-term interest rates: High inflation erodes the real value of future bond payments, causing investors to demand higher yields as compensation for the reduced purchasing power. Short-term interest rates also impact bond yields; if short-term rates rise, investors may shift from longer-term bonds (like government bonds) to higher-yielding short-term investments, increasing G-Sec yields.  Inflation is a general increase in prices across an economy, while short-term interest rates are the interest rates on short-term debt instruments.\n\n\nTherefore, all three factors \u2013 US Fed actions, RBI actions, and inflation/short-term interest rates \u2013 significantly influence Indian Government Bond Yields.\n"

Let's examine the options:\n\n1. **Foreign currency convertible bonds:** These are debt instruments, not equity investments, so they don't represent FDI.\n\n2. **Foreign institutional investment with certain conditions:**  This can be FDI if the investment gives the investor significant control or influence over the foreign enterprise.  However, it may also represent portfolio investment if it doesn't involve such control.\n\n3. **Global depository receipts (GDRs):** GDRs represent ownership in a foreign company, but they are traded on international exchanges and don't necessarily provide control or influence.  Therefore, they are generally considered portfolio investment, not FDI.\n\n4. **Non-resident external deposits:** These are short-term deposits, not long-term investments aimed at gaining control of a foreign enterprise.  They are not FDI.\n\nTherefore, only option 2 *could* be considered FDI, depending on the specific conditions attached to the investment.  However, given the other options, (b) 3 only is incorrect.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation:Creating new money to finance a budget deficit leads to the most inflation.  This is because increasing the money supply without a corresponding increase in the production of goods and services leads to a rise in the general price level.  Repaying public debt has a contractionary effect, reducing money supply and potentially lowering inflation. Borrowing from the public or banks increases demand for money, but doesn't directly increase the money supply as much as creating new money.\n\n\nPublic debt: The total amount of money a government owes to individuals, institutions, and other governments.  High levels can impact investor confidence and crowd out private sector borrowing.\n\nBudget deficit: When government spending exceeds its revenue in a given period.  It needs to be financed through borrowing or money creation.\n\nBorrowing from the public:  The government issues bonds or other securities to raise funds from individuals and institutions.  This increases demand for loanable funds, possibly raising interest rates.\n\nBorrowing from banks: The government borrows money from commercial banks.  This can increase the money supply through fractional reserve banking, but less directly than money creation.\n\nCreation of new money: The central bank prints new money or credits government accounts.  This directly increases the money supply, leading to inflation if not matched by increased output.  This is often referred to as monetizing the deficit.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): A measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  It is a key indicator of inflation.\n\nWholesale Price Index (WPI): A measure of the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output.  It can differ from CPI and may not always reflect consumer inflation accurately.\n\nInflation targeting: A monetary policy framework where the central bank publicly announces an explicit inflation target for the economy and commits to achieving it.  A tolerance band is often set around the target.\n\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC): A committee responsible for setting interest rates and other monetary policy instruments to achieve the inflation target.\n\nFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act: Legislation aimed at improving fiscal discipline and reducing the fiscal deficit in India.  It sets targets for the deficit and public debt.\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI): The central bank of India, responsible for monetary policy, regulating banks, and managing the country's foreign exchange reserves.\n\nOpen Market Operations (OMO): The buying and selling of government securities by the central bank to influence the money supply and interest rates.  Buying securities increases the money supply.\n\nRegional Rural Banks (RRBs): Banks jointly owned by the central government, state governments, and sponsor banks, primarily serving rural areas.\n\nPriority Sector Lending (PSL):  A policy requiring banks to lend a certain percentage of their credit to priority sectors like agriculture and small-scale industries.\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs): Financial institutions that provide various financial services but do not accept demand deposits.\n\nHousing Finance Companies (HFCs): NBFCs specializing in providing loans for housing.\n\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI):  Legislation allowing banks to recover non-performing assets (NPAs) without going through lengthy court procedures.\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): A law providing a time-bound framework for resolving insolvency and bankruptcy cases.\n\nNational Payments Corporation of India (NPCI): An umbrella organization for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India.\n\nGoods and Services Tax (GST): A comprehensive indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services in India.\n\nFiscal deficit:  The difference between a government's total expenditure and its revenue receipts (excluding borrowings).

Increased government spending as part of a stimulus package increases aggregate demand, potentially fueling inflation.\n\n3. **Inflation-indexing wages:** When wages are indexed to inflation, it means they rise automatically with inflation. This can contribute to a wage-price spiral, where rising wages lead to higher prices, which in turn lead to even higher wages, further increasing inflation.  It is a cost-push factor, not demand-pull.\n\n4. **Higher purchasing power:** Increased purchasing power, resulting from factors like higher incomes or lower taxes, leads to greater demand for goods and services. If supply cannot keep up, this increased demand can cause prices to rise, leading to demand-pull inflation.\n\n5. **Rising interest rates:** Rising interest rates are a contractionary monetary policy tool used to curb inflation by reducing borrowing and spending.  This reduces aggregate demand and thus counteracts demand-pull inflation.\n\n\nTherefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 directly contribute to or increase demand-pull inflation.

Many cnidarians engage in symbiotic relationships, such as coral polyps and zooxanthellae (a type of algae). The algae provide the coral with food through photosynthesis, and the coral provides the algae with a protected environment and nutrients.\n\n* **Fungi:** Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that play crucial roles in ecosystems.  Many fungi form mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, where the fungus provides the plant with water and nutrients, and the plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates.  Lichens are another example of a symbiotic relationship involving fungi and algae or cyanobacteria.\n\n* **Protozoa:** Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms.  Many protozoa are parasites, forming parasitic relationships with other organisms.  However, some protozoa also engage in mutualistic relationships, such as certain protozoa that live in the guts of animals and aid in digestion.  Therefore, all three groups demonstrate the capacity for symbiotic interactions.\n"

Permaculture emphasizes biodiversity and avoids monoculture (planting a single crop repeatedly), while conventional chemical farming often relies heavily on monoculture for efficiency and profit.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct.  Conventional chemical farming's overuse of irrigation and fertilizers *can* lead to soil salinity.  However, it's not always the case, and the link isn't as direct as the statement implies. Permaculture's focus on soil health and water management generally mitigates salinity risks, but it doesn't entirely eliminate the possibility.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Permaculture, with its emphasis on water conservation techniques, can be successfully implemented in semi-arid regions.  Conventional chemical farming, while possible, often faces challenges in such regions due to water scarcity and the need for high fertilizer and pesticide inputs.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Mulching is a key practice in permaculture, helping retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil health.  It's less common in conventional chemical farming, which might utilize other weed control methods.\n\n\nTherefore, statements 1 and 4 accurately describe differences between permaculture and conventional chemical farming.

        "explanation": "* **correct_option:** (d)\n* **explanation:** Astronomical distances are measured in light-years because the speed of light is constant.  A light-year is the distance light travels in one year. Since the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second), it provides a consistent and reliable unit for measuring the vast distances between celestial objects.  The other options are incorrect: distances between stars do change (albeit very slowly), gravity's influence varies depending on mass and distance, and while light generally travels in a straight line, its path can be bent by gravity (gravitational lensing).\n\nLight-year: A unit of astronomical distance equivalent to the distance that light travels in one year, approximately 9.461 \u00d7 10^15 meters.\n\nSpeed of light: A fundamental physical constant representing the speed at which light waves propagate through a vacuum.  It's approximately 299,792,458 meters per second and is denoted by the letter 'c'.\n\nStellar bodies:  General term for stars and other celestial objects like planets.\n\nGravity: The force of attraction between objects with mass.  The strength of gravity is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n"

Granting unguided and uncontrolled discretionary power to the executive violates this principle because it allows for arbitrary and unequal application of the law, undermining the fundamental right to equality.  The executive would be able to apply the law differently to different individuals or groups without any clear, justifiable standards, thus violating the principle of equality before the law.  Articles 28, 32, and 44 deal with different aspects of the Constitution: Article 28 relates to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion; Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies; and Article 44 is a directive principle relating to a uniform civil code.  They are not directly relevant to the issue of uncontrolled discretionary powers leading to unequal application of law.\n\n**Short notes on named entities:**\n\n* **Article 14:** This article of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. It prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.  However, reasonable classification is permitted if based on intelligible differentia and substantial distinction.\n\n* **Article 28:** This article deals with freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate one's religion.  It also sets limitations on the use of public funds for religious purposes.\n\n* **Article 32:** This article is a fundamental right that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. It allows citizens to approach the Supreme Court of India for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.\n\n* **Article 44:** This article is a Directive Principle of State Policy that advocates for the adoption of a uniform civil code throughout India.  This means a single set of laws would govern personal matters for all citizens, irrespective of their religion.\n\n* **Rule of Law:** A principle of governance where all individuals and institutions, including the government, are accountable to and subject to the law.  It is central to the concept of a just and fair society.  A.V. Dicey, a British jurist, is associated with a specific articulation of this principle.\n\n* **Separation of Powers:**  This is a doctrine of constitutional law that divides governmental power among distinct branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) to prevent tyranny.  While not strictly followed in India, it's a guiding principle.  Checks and balances between these branches are crucial.\n\n* **Judicial Review:** The power of the judiciary to review laws and government actions to ensure they are consistent with the Constitution.  It is a crucial safeguard against arbitrary or unconstitutional actions.\n\n* **Judicial Activism:** This is when courts actively engage in shaping public policy, often by interpreting the Constitution broadly or extending its reach into areas previously considered the domain of the legislature or executive.

        "explanation": "correct_option: (d)\nexplanation:A committed judiciary is crucial for upholding the rule of law and protecting individual liberties.  Centralization of powers risks tyranny, while elected government, though essential, is not a sufficient safeguard without checks and balances. Separation of powers, dividing governmental authority among distinct branches (legislative, executive, and judicial), creates a system of checks and balances that best protects liberty in a liberal democracy.  This prevents any single branch from becoming too powerful and infringing on individual rights.  James Madison's quote highlights the dangers of concentrated power, emphasizing the importance of this separation.  The Indian Constitution, drawing on various models, incorporates this principle, with the judiciary playing a significant role in interpreting and upholding constitutional limits on governmental authority.  The judiciary's power of judicial review allows it to strike down laws deemed unconstitutional.  However, the balance between the branches can be delicate and subject to political tension, as seen in debates surrounding judicial activism and the interpretation of the \"basic structure\" doctrine.\n"

        "explanation": "correct_option: (b)\nexplanation:The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, aim to establish a social and economic democracy.  While not legally enforceable like Fundamental Rights, they guide the state in policy formulation.  One such principle (Article 39(c))  specifically directs the state to ensure that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good, and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment.  Therefore, concentration of wealth violates the spirit and intent of the Directive Principles.\n\nRight to Equality (Article 14-18) primarily deals with legal and social equality before the law. While extreme wealth disparity might indirectly impact equality of opportunity, it's not a direct violation of the Right to Equality itself.\n\nThe Right to Freedom (Article 19-22) guarantees fundamental freedoms such as freedom of speech, assembly, etc., and is not directly related to wealth distribution.\n\nThe \"Concept of Welfare State\" is a broader socio-political concept reflecting the government's role in ensuring social well-being.  While concentration of wealth contradicts the ideals of a welfare state, it's not a constitutional concept in itself.\n\n\n**Short Notes:**\n\n* **Directive Principles of State Policy:** These are non-justiciable principles that guide the state in making laws and policies to achieve social and economic justice. They aim to create a welfare state.\n\n* **Right to Equality:** This fundamental right ensures equal treatment before the law and prohibits discrimination on various grounds.\n\n* **Right to Freedom:** This set of fundamental rights guarantees several freedoms including speech, assembly, movement, etc.\n\n* **Concept of Welfare State:**  A state that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens by providing social services and safety nets.  Concentration of wealth undermines this concept.\n\n* **Article 39(c):** This specific article within the Directive Principles directs the state to prevent the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment.\n"

        "year": 2021,
        "explanation": "correct_option: (b)\n\nexplanation:The Right to Property was originally a Fundamental Right under Article 31 of the Indian Constitution.  However, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed it from the list of Fundamental Rights.  It is now a legal right, guaranteed by Article 300A, available to any person, not just citizens.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.\n\nA **Fundamental Right** is a basic human right guaranteed and protected by the Constitution of India.  These rights are considered essential for the full development of an individual's personality.  The violation of a Fundamental Right can be challenged in court.  \n\nA **legal right** is a right conferred by law.  While it may not have the same level of protection as a Fundamental Right, it is still legally enforceable.  The distinction is crucial because Fundamental Rights are considered inviolable, while legal rights can be subjected to limitations under specific circumstances.  \n\nThe **44th Amendment Act** (1978) was a significant constitutional amendment that, among other things, removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, recognizing that it sometimes conflicted with the government's developmental goals.  The amendment aimed at strengthening the state's capacity to implement land reforms and other socioeconomic policies.\n\n\nThe provided context mentions various land reforms and their impact, including the challenges faced in implementing land ceiling laws, the role of landlords, and the mobilization of peasants.  These efforts relate to the practical application and limitations of the Right to Property, even after it ceased to be a Fundamental Right.  The context also highlights the legal framework (Article 39) concerning the distribution and control of material resources, underscoring the continued relevance of property rights in India's socio-economic policies.\n"

While the original constitution did establish a \"Sovereign Democratic Republic\", the term \"Socialist\" was added through the 42nd Amendment in 1976, and \"Secular\" was implicitly present from the beginning but explicitly added in the 42nd Amendment as well.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the constitutional status of India on that date, considering the later amendments that further clarified the nature of the republic.\n\nSovereign:  India is an independent nation, not subject to any external authority. It has supreme authority within its own territory and can govern itself without interference from other countries.\n\nSocialist: This term, added later, reflects the commitment to social justice and welfare of the people, aiming for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.  Although not explicitly defined in the constitution, it implies a commitment to reducing inequalities and promoting social welfare programs.\n\nSecular:  The state remains neutral in matters of religion, granting equal rights to all religions and preventing religious discrimination. The state does not favor any particular religion over another.  It ensures religious freedom for all citizens.\n\nDemocratic:  The government is based on the principles of democracy, with power vested in the people and exercised through elected representatives.  It ensures the participation of the people in the governance of the country.\n\nRepublic:  The head of state is not a hereditary monarch but an elected president. It signifies that supreme power resides in the people and their elected representatives.\n"
