Tilak used the newspaper as a powerful platform to articulate his political views, challenge British authority, and galvanize public opinion.  His writings often emphasized Hindu identity and history, contributing to the rise of Hindu nationalism, but religious harmony was not its central theme.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Tilak's shrewd use of the Ganapati and Shivaji festivals was a masterstroke in mobilizing mass support for the nationalist cause.  These festivals, celebrating Hindu deities and historical figures, transcended regional and caste boundaries, bringing together diverse segments of the population under a shared nationalist banner.  The festivals served as potent symbols of Hindu identity and resistance against British rule, demonstrating Tilak's effectiveness in harnessing religious sentiment for political mobilization.

While the Portuguese presence in Bengal did impact trade, it's inaccurate to describe this impact as leading to \"economic prosperity\" for the region. Their activities often involved exploitation and disruption, rather than widespread economic benefit for the local population.  The statement oversimplifies the complex economic consequences of colonial presence, highlighting the need for a critical and nuanced understanding of historical impact.

The Second World War did indeed stimulate industrial growth in India, as the British government sought to utilize Indian resources for its war effort.  However, this growth was primarily focused on war-related industries and did not translate into a broad-based economic development benefiting all sectors. The increase in industrial output was uneven and primarily concentrated in specific sectors catering to the war needs.  The overall economic impact on the Indian population was mixed.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While some segments of the Indian economy experienced growth, the war years were marked by widespread inflation, shortages of essential goods, and increased poverty among the vast majority of the population, especially peasants and workers.  The war effort, while boosting certain industries, led to immense hardship for many due to resource allocation prioritizing war materials.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The war significantly exacerbated existing social and political tensions within India. The increased demands placed on the Indian population, coupled with the British government's continued refusal to grant self-governance, fuelled nationalist sentiment and intensified the movement for independence. The war acted as a catalyst, accelerating the pace of the independence movement and ultimately contributing to the partition of India.

The division of assets and personnel was far from smooth.  It was a chaotic process that led to considerable confusion and conflict, particularly within the armed forces.  The hasty nature of the partition meant that many decisions were made under immense pressure, contributing to the widespread violence.  The allocation of resources and personnel was a major source of tension between India and Pakistan.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the assassination of Gandhi was influenced by the political climate of the time, including the refugee crisis, it was not directly caused by the failure of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact.  Nathuram Godse, Gandhi's assassin, had a complex set of motivations, including his opposition to Gandhi's perceived appeasement of Muslims.

While the extent of Chola naval reach is debated, historical evidence suggests significant maritime trade between the Chola Empire and China.  This trade involved goods, technologies, and cultural exchange, including the exchange of ambassadors, though the scale and nature of this interaction are areas of ongoing scholarly discussion. The presence of Chola artifacts in Southeast Asia and the documented interactions of Chola rulers with distant powers strongly support the existence of these maritime links.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While Buddhist monks from India did travel to China and played a significant role in the transmission of Buddhism, the interaction was not entirely one-sided.  Chinese Buddhism, in turn, influenced the development of Buddhist practices and thought in India.  There was a significant exchange of ideas, texts, and artistic styles between the two countries, leading to a dynamic evolution of Buddhism in both regions.  The idea of a one-way flow significantly underestimates the complexity and reciprocal nature of this historical exchange.  This reciprocal interaction is reflected in the evolution of Mahayana Buddhism, which shows clear influences from both Indian and Chinese traditions.\n"}, {"id": 57344, "subject": "GEO", "question_content_type": "STATIC", "pattern_type": "TWO_STATEMENTS", "question_text": "With reference to the Earth's physical characteristics and processes, consider the following statements:**\n\n1.

Atmospheric particles like aerosols, dust, and water vapor scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation, influencing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface. This affects atmospheric transparency and temperature. Statement 3 is correct.  The scattering of sunlight depends on the relationship between the wavelength of light and the size of the particles it encounters.  Rayleigh scattering (scattering of shorter wavelengths like blue light) is dominant when particle size is smaller than the wavelength, while Mie scattering (scattering of longer wavelengths) is more significant when particle size is comparable to or larger than the wavelength.\n\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct in that greenhouse gases do contribute to the greenhouse effect.  However, stating that this effect is negligible in the thermosphere is incorrect. While the greenhouse effect is most pronounced in the troposphere, the thermosphere also experiences some radiative processes involving absorption and emission of energy.  The concentration of greenhouse gases is much lower in the thermosphere compared to the lower atmospheric layers, but their influence is not entirely negligible.  The thermosphere\u2019s temperature is primarily driven by the absorption of high-energy solar radiation by atmospheric gases, not the greenhouse effect.\n"}, {"id": 58573, "subject": "GEO", "question_content_type": "STATIC", "pattern_type": "MATCH_THE_PAIRS", "question_text": "Consider the following pairs:**\n\n    Country        Major River\n    1.
