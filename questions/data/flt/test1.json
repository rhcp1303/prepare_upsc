        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe No-Changers, a faction within the Congress led by prominent figures like C. Rajagopalachari, Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, and M.A. Ansari, vehemently opposed the Swarajists' proposal to enter the legislative councils.  They argued that participation in council politics would dilute the revolutionary zeal of the movement, lead to political corruption, and distract from crucial constructive work aimed at strengthening the nationalist movement at the grassroots level. Their emphasis remained on non-cooperation, boycott, and quiet preparation for the resumption of civil disobedience. The Responsivists were a later internal faction within the Swarajist party, while the Hindustan Republican Association was a separate revolutionary organization altogether.  The No-Changers' stance represents a crucial ideological divergence within the Congress during this period, highlighting the complexities of strategies employed in the fight for independence.  Their focus on constructive work, while seemingly passive, was viewed as essential for building the strength and unity required for future mass movements.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the key players and their differing viewpoints within the nationalist movement.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Gandhi-Irwin Pact, signed in March 1931, was a significant agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, the Viceroy of India, marking a temporary truce in the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the pact did lead to the release of many political prisoners, it did *not* secure the release of all prisoners irrespective of their crimes.  The release was conditional, excluding those convicted of violence. This crucial distinction highlights the limitations of the pact and the British government's continued reluctance to fully concede to nationalist demands.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A key concession made by the British government in the pact was the granting of the right to manufacture salt for personal consumption in coastal villages. This was a significant symbolic victory for the nationalists, as the salt tax was a major source of grievance and a powerful symbol of British oppression. However, the right was limited to personal consumption; the manufacture and sale of salt remained illegal, reflecting the continued restrictions on economic freedom.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key provision of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.\n"

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately reflects the content of the Communal Award. Announced by Ramsay MacDonald in August 1932, this award established separate electorates for various minority groups, notably Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, and the depressed classes (Dalits). The provision of separate electorates for the depressed classes was particularly controversial, as it further marginalized them within the political system.  The Award was a direct consequence of the failure to reach consensus on minority representation at the Round Table Conferences.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Poona Pact (September 1932), resulting from Gandhi's fast unto death, significantly altered the Communal Award.  It abolished separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with a system of reserved seats within joint electorates.  This meant that while the depressed classes still had reserved seats in the legislatures, they would be elected through the same electorate as other Hindus, thereby preventing further political segregation.  The Pact, while a compromise, represented a crucial step in countering the divisive effects of the Communal Award and promoting greater political unity among Hindus.\n"

Nehru and Bose were key figures within the Congress who embraced socialist and Marxist ideas, advocating for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and critiquing Gandhian methods.  Statement 3 is correct. The Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case (1924) saw the arrest of several prominent communists and trade unionists, marking a significant event in the early development of the communist movement in India.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 2 and 4 correctly describe aspects of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I, was a crucial factor in mobilizing Muslim support for the movement, and its initial success was significantly linked to this religious and pan-Islamic sentiment. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against the police, led Gandhi to suspend the movement, highlighting the challenges in maintaining non-violent discipline during mass mobilization.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while the Jallianwala Bagh massacre fueled widespread anger and anti-British sentiment, it was not the primary cause for the launch of the Non-Cooperation movement. The movement had broader goals, including addressing the Punjab atrocities, the Rowlatt Act, and the Khilafat issue.

The immediate response involved a heightened focus on suppressing any form of Indian nationalism or dissent, leading to increased surveillance and repression.  The administrative structure was reorganized to centralize power in the hands of the British, reducing the autonomy of local administrations.  The British also increasingly relied on Indian princes and loyal elites to maintain control, utilizing the existing power structures to their advantage.  The implementation of social reforms, while a feature of British rule, was not an immediate or primary consequence of the 1857 Revolt; it was a more gradual and long-term strategy. Therefore, the immediate and direct consequences of the revolt were the increased suppression of dissent, the centralization of power, and the greater reliance on loyal Indian elites.\n"

The age limit safeguards against the potential for extended periods of service.  The appointment process ensures the selection of a qualified individual.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

The reports cover the accounts of the Union and State governments, as well as other public bodies.
