This leads to a higher annual temperature range in continental interiors compared to coastal regions at the same latitude.\n"}, {"id": 56491, "subject": "GEO", "question_content_type": "STATIC", "pattern_type": "TWO_STATEMENTS", "question_text": "With reference to the geographical features of Ladakh, consider the following statements:**\n\n1.
