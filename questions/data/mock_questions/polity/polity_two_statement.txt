**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable and enforceable in courts of law.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy aim to establish a welfare state by balancing individual rights with social justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable by courts.  While they guide the state's actions, they do not create legally enforceable rights for individuals.  The courts cannot compel the government to implement them.  This is a key difference between DPSPs and Fundamental Rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs are designed to create a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice. They aim to balance individual liberty with the collective well-being of society.  They address issues such as social security, education, healthcare, and equal pay. The overall goal is to improve the quality of life for all citizens and reduce social and economic inequalities.  The inclusion of DPSPs reflects the Constitution's commitment to a welfare state that prioritizes social justice alongside individual freedoms.


**2. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can introduce and pass any bill, including money bills, but the Lok Sabha has the final say in the legislative process.
2. The Rajya Sabha can only delay, but cannot completely block, the passage of money bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can indeed introduce and pass bills other than money bills, it cannot introduce or amend money bills.  Money bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to recommending amendments to money bills, but the Lok Sabha has the final authority to accept or reject those recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha's power regarding money bills is limited to delaying their passage. It can only hold a money bill for a maximum of 14 days. After this period, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both houses, even without Rajya Sabha's approval.  Therefore, the Rajya Sabha cannot completely veto a money bill.  This constitutional provision reflects the Lok Sabha's greater authority over financial matters.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established a bicameral legislature at the centre, comprising the Council of State and the Legislative Assembly.
2. The Act introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance, in the provinces, dividing powers between elected ministers and the Governor.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919 (also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms) significantly altered the Indian legislative structure.  It established a bicameral legislature at the central level, consisting of the Council of State (upper house) and the Legislative Assembly (lower house). While the Council of State had limited powers, this marked a step towards greater Indian participation in governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. A defining feature of the 1919 Act was the introduction of dyarchy in the provinces.  This system divided the provincial subjects into two categories: transferred subjects (administered by elected Indian ministers) and reserved subjects (administered by the Governor and his executive council).  Dyarchy aimed to gradually introduce responsible government at the provincial level while maintaining British control over key areas.  The system, however, proved to be inefficient and ultimately unsuccessful.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. A joint sitting of both houses of Parliament is convened only when there is a deadlock on a non-money bill.
2. In a joint sitting, the bill is passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A joint sitting of both houses of Parliament can be convened when there's a disagreement between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on any bill, including money bills (excluding money bills, this is the only way to resolve the deadlock).  The President summons the joint sitting.  The disagreement must be on the same version of the bill.


Statement 2 is correct.  In a joint sitting, the bill is passed by a simple majority of the total number of members present and voting.  This is different from the usual requirement of a majority in both houses separately.  The simple majority in a joint sitting reflects the principle of majority rule in the legislative process.  A joint sitting is a rare event, used only to resolve significant legislative impasses.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, shifting the focus from centralized planning to cooperative federalism.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio chairman of NITI Aayog, and the Governing Council comprises the Chief Ministers of all states and Union Territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), established in 2015, replaced the Planning Commission.  A key difference is the shift from a centralized, command-and-control approach to a more collaborative approach involving states and other stakeholders. The focus is on cooperative federalism, emphasizing the role of states in development planning.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of NITI Aayog. The Governing Council, a key decision-making body, is composed of the Chief Ministers of all states and Union Territories. This structure underscores the emphasis on cooperative federalism and the involvement of states in national development strategies.  The Governing Council's role is to provide overall direction and guidance to NITI Aayog.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The executive power of the Union of India is vested in the President, who exercises it through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the National Development Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 53 of the Indian Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President. However, the President exercises this power through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system of government in India. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are responsible to the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister holds a significant position in the National Development Council (NDC), they are not the ex-officio chairman. The Prime Minister chairs the NDC, but it's not a constitutional position like the chairmanship of NITI Aayog.  The NDC is a forum for coordinating development policies between the Centre and the States.


**7. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in certain states.
2. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in certain states. It provides for the appointment of a Governor's agent to oversee the administration of these areas and empowers the state legislature to make regulations for the welfare and protection of Scheduled Tribes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India, primarily Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. These councils have powers over various aspects of local governance, including land management and taxation.  The Sixth Schedule aims to safeguard the unique cultural and administrative needs of the tribal populations in these regions.


**8. With reference to the Union Government's budgetary process, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Expenditure is responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget.
2.  The Parliament's authorization is required for the withdrawal of funds from both the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget, not the Department of Expenditure.  The Department of Expenditure plays a crucial role in budget execution and management, but the initial preparation and formulation rest with the Department of Revenue.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 266 of the Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India (the primary account of the government) without the authorization of Parliament.  Similarly, while the Public Account is not subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the Consolidated Fund, it still requires parliamentary authorization for withdrawals in many cases.  This ensures parliamentary control over government spending.


**9.  With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is the custodian of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court interprets it.
2. The Preamble to the Constitution outlines the basic principles and objectives of the Indian state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the President is the head of state and swears to uphold the Constitution, it's the Supreme Court that holds the ultimate authority in interpreting the Constitution.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review enables it to determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Preamble to the Constitution succinctly encapsulates the fundamental values and aspirations of the Indian state. It declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, aiming to secure justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all its citizens.  The Preamble serves as a guiding principle in interpreting the Constitution's provisions.


**10. With reference to the recently granted classical language status, consider the following statements:**

1.  Odia language has been recently granted classical language status.
2.  The classical language status is conferred by the Ministry of Culture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odia was granted classical language status earlier, not recently.  The question is designed to mislead by focusing on the recent aspect.  Several languages have already been granted this status.

Statement 2 is correct. The classical language status is conferred by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.  This status involves recognition of the language's rich historical and literary heritage.  The conferment of this status usually leads to increased government support for the promotion and preservation of the language.  The criteria for conferring classical language status include a long and unbroken literary tradition, its influence on other languages, and its historical significance.



**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Legislative Council of a State can have a maximum size equal to one-third of the total strength of the Legislative Assembly of that State.
2. The Governor of a State nominates one-sixth of the members of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 171(3) of the Constitution specifies that the maximum strength of the Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) of a state cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) of that state.  This ensures that the upper house does not overshadow the lower house, which is directly elected by the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Governor nominates one-twelfth of the members to the Legislative Council, not one-sixth.  These nominated members typically represent areas of expertise such as science, art, literature, and social service.  The Governor's power of nomination is intended to bring diverse perspectives into the upper house.


**12. With reference to the provision “To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity and Integrity of India”, consider the following statements:**

1.  This provision is mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2.  This provision is a Fundamental Duty of every citizen.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The phrase "To secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" is part of the Preamble to the Constitution of India.  The Preamble sets out the fundamental objectives and values that underpin the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While upholding the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India is a crucial national responsibility, it's not explicitly listed as a Fundamental Duty in Part IV-A of the Constitution.  The Fundamental Duties are moral obligations on citizens, but they are not legally enforceable in the same way as Fundamental Rights.  The emphasis on unity and integrity is implicit in various constitutional provisions and in the national ethos.


**13.  Consider the following statements regarding the Parliamentary procedure:**

1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses on its prorogation, while a bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse on dissolution of the Lok Sabha.
2.  A bill passed by one house and pending in another house lapses only on the prorogation of the session of that house.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses automatically when the Lok Sabha is prorogued (session ends). However, if a bill is passed by the Lok Sabha and pending in the Rajya Sabha, and the Lok Sabha is dissolved, it does not automatically lapse. This is because the bill has already been passed by one house. The same applies to the Rajya Sabha. If a bill is pending in the Lok Sabha after being passed by the Rajya Sabha and the Rajya Sabha is prorogued, it does not lapse.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A bill pending in one house after being passed by the other house does not lapse automatically upon prorogation of the session of the first house. It only lapses upon prorogation of the session of the house in which it is pending.


**14. With reference to the appointment of the Chief Secretary in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chief Secretary is appointed by the Governor of the State.
2. The Chief Secretary holds office for a fixed tenure as specified in the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chief Secretary is appointed by the Governor of the state on the advice of the Chief Minister.  This is a crucial administrative appointment, reflecting the state government's structure.  The Chief Secretary serves as the head of the state's civil service and plays a vital role in the implementation of government policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure prescribed by the Constitution.  While there may be norms and practices related to the term of office, it is not a constitutionally mandated fixed tenure. The Chief Secretary's tenure can be influenced by various factors, including the government in power.


**15. With reference to the Gram Nyayalaya Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas can hear both civil and criminal cases.
2.  The Act mandates the involvement of local social activists as mediators/reconciliators in all cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalaya Act allows Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) to handle both civil and criminal cases, subject to certain monetary and jurisdictional limits.  The goal is to provide speedy and accessible justice at the village level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act encourages alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, it doesn't mandate the involvement of local social activists as mediators in all cases.  The use of mediators is discretionary, depending on the nature of the case and the parties' agreement.  The Act primarily aims to provide a simpler and more accessible judicial system in rural areas.



**16. With reference to the Parliament's power to legislate on State List matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority.
2.  The Parliament's power to legislate on State List matters during a national emergency extends only to those matters directly related to the emergency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 249 of the Constitution allows Parliament to legislate on State List matters if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is in the national interest to do so. However, it does not require a two-thirds majority; a simple majority is sufficient.  This provision is a safeguard to address exceptional circumstances when national interests necessitate overriding state legislative powers.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 250 allows Parliament to legislate on State List matters during a national emergency, but this power is restricted to matters directly related to the emergency.  Once the emergency is over, the Parliament's legislative power on these matters reverts to the state legislatures unless a separate resolution under Article 249 is passed.



**17. Consider the following statements regarding the minimum age for Panchayat members:**

1. The minimum age prescribed for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.
2.  The minimum age for contesting elections for the post of Sarpanch (village head) is higher than the minimum age for becoming a Panchayat member.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act sets the minimum age for being a member of a Panchayat at 21 years.  This is consistent with the minimum age for voting in India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the minimum age for being a Panchayat member is 21, the minimum age for contesting elections for the post of Sarpanch (village head) is often higher, varying from state to state.  Some states may set the minimum age for Sarpanch at 25 or even higher. This reflects the greater responsibilities associated with the position of Sarpanch.


**18. With reference to the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposals aimed at introducing responsible government at the provincial level.
2. The proposals were primarily focused on social and educational reforms in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms (1918), which formed the basis of the Government of India Act of 1919, aimed at introducing a limited form of responsible government in the provinces.  This involved transferring certain subjects to Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures. While still under the overall control of the Governor, this was a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals did touch upon some social and educational issues, their primary focus was constitutional reform, particularly introducing the dyarchy system in the provinces.  The reforms were a response to growing Indian demands for greater self-rule and were part of the ongoing evolution of British India's political structure.


**19. With reference to the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble explicitly mentions the concept of a welfare state.
2. The Preamble guarantees fundamental rights, including the right to equality, liberty, and fraternity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble does not explicitly use the term "welfare state," the objectives it outlines, such as social, economic, and political justice, along with liberty, equality, and fraternity, inherently imply a commitment to a welfare state.  The Directive Principles of State Policy further elaborate on this commitment.

Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble explicitly guarantees fundamental rights, including the right to equality, liberty, and fraternity.  These rights are elaborated in Part III of the Constitution and are legally enforceable by the courts.  They are considered cornerstones of the Indian democratic system.


**20. With reference to the Right against Exploitation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right against Exploitation prohibits bonded labour but does not prohibit forced labour.
2.  The Right against Exploitation includes the prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Right against Exploitation, as enshrined in Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution, prohibits both bonded labour and forced labour.  Bonded labour is a form of forced labour where individuals are compelled to work to repay a debt.  The prohibition of both reflects the Constitution's commitment to human dignity and freedom from exploitation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 23 explicitly prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour.  This is a crucial aspect of the Right against Exploitation, aimed at protecting vulnerable individuals from being coerced into work against their will.  Article 24 further prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in hazardous industries.



**21. With reference to the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties are enforceable by law.
2.  The Fundamental Duties are intended to promote a sense of national unity and social cohesion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Fundamental Duties, enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution, are not legally enforceable.  They are moral obligations on citizens, intended to guide their behaviour and contribute to the well-being of the nation.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable, the Fundamental Duties are aspirational in nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Fundamental Duties are designed to foster a sense of national unity and social cohesion.  They emphasize values such as respecting the Constitution, protecting public property, and promoting scientific temper.  The inclusion of Fundamental Duties reflects the Constitution's broader aim to create a responsible and engaged citizenry.


**22. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are meant to promote the welfare state in India.
2. The Directive Principles are enforceable by the courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are a set of guidelines for the state to achieve a welfare state.  They aim to promote social and economic justice, ensuring a better quality of life for all citizens.  DPSPs cover various areas, including education, healthcare, and social security.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable by the courts. While they serve as guidelines for the government, the courts cannot compel the government to implement them.  This distinguishes them from Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable and legally enforceable.


**23. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants presented by the government.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss and debate the Annual Financial Statement (budget), but cannot vote on it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha.  The Demands for Grants are the detailed estimates of government expenditure for a financial year.  The Lok Sabha's power to vote on these reflects its greater control over the government's finances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss and debate the Annual Financial Statement (budget), but it cannot vote on it.  The Lok Sabha has the sole power to approve the budget.  The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters.


**24. With reference to the election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  A person can be a candidate for Lok Sabha elections only if their name appears in the electoral roll of the constituency they are contesting.
2.  A person must obtain at least 50% of the valid votes polled to be declared elected to the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  To contest a Lok Sabha election, a candidate's name must be included in the electoral roll of the constituency from which they are contesting.  This is a fundamental requirement to ensure that only eligible individuals can stand for election.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There's no requirement for a candidate to secure 50% of the valid votes polled to win a Lok Sabha election.  A candidate wins by securing the highest number of votes in the constituency, even if it's less than 50% of the total votes cast.  This is a feature of the first-past-the-post electoral system used in India.


**25. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.
2. The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.  This election typically takes place at the beginning of a new Lok Sabha session.  The Speaker presides over the Lok Sabha's proceedings and plays a crucial role in maintaining order and decorum.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is also elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.  The Deputy Speaker acts as the Speaker's deputy and presides over the House in the Speaker's absence.  Both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker are crucial for the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha.


**26. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly mentions the word "Budget."
2. The Constitution lays down the procedure for the presentation and passage of the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly mention the word "Budget."  However, the constitutional provisions related to financial matters, such as Articles 112 (Annual Financial Statement), 113 (Appropriation Bills), and 114 (Procedure in Parliament with respect to estimates), implicitly define the budgetary process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution outlines the procedure for the presentation and passage of the Union Budget.  This procedure involves the presentation of the budget by the Finance Minister, its discussion and debate in Parliament, and the passage of related bills.  The constitutional framework ensures parliamentary control over government finances.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the Money Bill:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  This is a crucial aspect of the Indian Constitution's financial provisions, emphasizing the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to recommending amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on whether to accept or reject these recommendations.  The Rajya Sabha's limited power over Money Bills reinforces the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters.


**28. With reference to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The Parliament's authorization is required for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. All revenues received by the Union Government, from taxes and other sources, are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.  This is the primary account of the government, holding all public money.  This provision ensures transparency and accountability in the management of government finances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Article 266 of the Constitution explicitly states that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  This ensures parliamentary control over government spending and prevents unauthorized withdrawals.


**29. With reference to the Public Account of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Account of India is subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The Public Account of India includes moneys received by or on behalf of the government, other than those credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Account of India is not subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the Consolidated Fund of India. While parliamentary authorization is required for withdrawals in many cases, it's not as stringent as for the Consolidated Fund.  The Public Account mainly deals with funds that are not part of the government's general revenues.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public Account of India includes various funds such as deposits, remittances, and other moneys received by or on behalf of the government, but which are not part of the Consolidated Fund.  This includes funds held for specific purposes, such as small savings schemes or provident funds.

**1. With reference to the theory of basic structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly lists all the basic tenets.
2.  The judiciary has the sole authority to determine which aspects of the Constitution constitute the basic structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The theory of basic structure doesn't have a pre-defined list of tenets within the Constitution itself.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the basic structure is not explicitly defined in the Constitution; rather, it's a judicially evolved concept. The Supreme Court, in cases like *Kesavananda Bharati*, identified and progressively refined the understanding of what constitutes the basic structure.  While the judiciary plays a crucial role in defining the basic structure, it doesn't hold *sole* authority.  The legislature's role in constitutional amendments is also significant, although subject to the limitations imposed by the basic structure doctrine. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect. The identification of the basic structure is a dynamic process involving interaction between the judiciary and other branches of government.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the amendments made to the Indian Constitution between 2000 and 2003:**

1. The amendments during this period were largely uncontroversial, reflecting widespread agreement among political parties.
2.  The high number of amendments suggests a period of strong public pressure for constitutional changes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The fact that numerous amendments were made between 2000 and 2003 doesn't automatically imply either widespread agreement or intense public pressure.  Statement 1 is incorrect because a high volume of amendments can occur even with significant political disagreement.  The amendments could have resulted from diverse political motivations or internal party dynamics.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because the number of amendments doesn't directly correlate to public pressure.  While public opinion might have influenced some amendments, there could have been other factors, such as legislative priorities or political maneuvering, driving the high number of changes.  A thorough analysis of the specific amendments and the political context of the time is needed to reach a definitive conclusion on the underlying reasons.


**3. With reference to the reasons for requiring a special majority for amending the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. A special majority safeguards against hasty or ill-considered changes, ensuring stability and continuity.
2.  The special majority requirement ensures that amendments are only made with the support of a broad consensus across different political ideologies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The requirement of a special majority for amending the Constitution serves multiple purposes.  Statement 1 is correct because it prevents impulsive alterations to the fundamental framework of the nation.  The higher threshold for amendments provides a built-in mechanism for deliberation and careful consideration, reducing the risk of short-sighted or disruptive changes.  Statement 2 is also correct. A special majority helps to build consensus, implying that significant constitutional changes are not made without substantial support from across the political spectrum.  This enhances the legitimacy of the amendments and contributes to greater political stability.  The special majority requirement is thus crucial for balancing the need for adaptability with the imperative of maintaining the foundational principles of the Constitution.


**4. With reference to the differences between the Indian Constitution and Western ideas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution's understanding of secularism differs significantly from the Western model, emphasizing the state's neutrality towards all religions.
2.  The concept of affirmative action in India, aimed at addressing historical injustices, diverges from the Western emphasis on purely merit-based systems.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution's approach to secularism, often described as "positive secularism," differs from some Western models that might emphasize a strict separation of church and state.  Statement 1 is correct because India's secularism actively promotes the coexistence of various religions, unlike some Western approaches that may lean towards a more complete separation.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Western models often prioritize merit-based systems, while India's affirmative action policies aim to rectify historical inequalities faced by marginalized communities by providing them with preferential treatment in education and employment.  This highlights a key difference in philosophical perspectives on social justice and equality.


**5. Consider the following statements about the unrepresentative nature of the Indian Constitution's making:**

1. The Constituent Assembly's composition did not fully represent the diverse social and political groups within India.
2. The limited representation of marginalized groups in the Constituent Assembly resulted in a Constitution that inadequately addresses their concerns.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constituent Assembly, while a landmark achievement, faced limitations in its representation. Statement 1 is correct as various social groups, including women and certain marginalized communities, were underrepresented in the Assembly.  This underrepresentation is linked to the political climate and social structures of that era.  Statement 2 is also correct because this lack of diverse perspectives contributed to certain shortcomings in the Constitution, particularly concerning the needs and rights of marginalized groups. While the Constitution established fundamental rights and aimed for social justice, the concerns of certain sections remained inadequately addressed due to insufficient representation in the drafting process.  The subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations have attempted to address some of these shortcomings.


**6. With reference to gender justice in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution's provisions on gender equality are limited in scope and fail to address many deep-rooted societal inequalities.
2.  The absence of specific provisions addressing gender-based violence within the Constitution is a significant limitation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution, while guaranteeing equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination based on sex, has faced criticism for not fully addressing deep-rooted societal inequalities. Statement 1 is correct because despite constitutional guarantees, gender inequality persists in various forms (property rights, social norms, etc.).  The constitutional provisions, while significant, have not been sufficient to overcome entrenched patriarchal structures. Statement 2 is also correct. The absence of explicit provisions addressing specific forms of gender-based violence, such as domestic abuse or sexual harassment, within the Constitution is a major concern.  While some laws have been enacted to address these issues, the lack of explicit constitutional protection leaves a gap in legal redressal.


**7. With reference to the placement of socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles rather than Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Classifying socio-economic rights as Directive Principles allows the government greater flexibility in their implementation, based on available resources and changing priorities.
2.  Placing socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the limitations of a developing nation in immediately guaranteeing such rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The decision to place socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles rather than Fundamental Rights reflects a nuanced approach by the Constitution's framers. Statement 1 is correct because Directive Principles are not justiciable, allowing the state more flexibility in implementing them gradually, based on its financial capabilities and societal progress.  This avoids situations where the government might be legally bound to provide certain rights without adequate resources. Statement 2 is also correct.  The framers recognized the challenges faced by a newly independent and developing nation in immediately guaranteeing comprehensive socio-economic rights.  The Directive Principles provide a framework for striving towards these goals over time.  This approach balances the aspiration for social justice with the realities of resource constraints and developmental priorities.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Kesavananda Bharati case:**

1. The case established the doctrine of basic structure, limiting the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2. The Court, in this case, ruled that the right to property was a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The *Kesavananda Bharati* case (1973) is a landmark judgment in Indian constitutional law. Statement 1 is correct; the Supreme Court articulated the doctrine of basic structure, holding that Parliament's amending power is not unlimited and cannot alter the fundamental features of the Constitution.  This significantly impacted the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Court explicitly ruled that the right to property, while a fundamental right at the time, was *not* part of the basic structure and could therefore be amended. This ruling clarified the scope of the basic structure doctrine and the Parliament's power concerning fundamental rights.


**9.  With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court has held that all laws included in the Ninth Schedule are beyond judicial scrutiny.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ninth Schedule was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial review.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while initially laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely shielded from judicial review, the Supreme Court subsequently clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has held that even laws included in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate fundamental rights or the basic structure of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is also incorrect for the same reason; the Supreme Court has consistently maintained that judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the Indian Constitution and cannot be entirely bypassed, even by the Ninth Schedule.


**10. With reference to the powers of the Indian President, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament.
2. The President's power to withhold assent is absolute and cannot be overridden by Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian President has the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament. This is a crucial aspect of the President's role in the legislative process. Statement 1 is correct; this power acts as a check on the legislative branch, although it's not absolute. Statement 2 is incorrect because while the President can withhold assent, this power is not absolute.  If a bill is returned to the President after being passed again by both houses of Parliament, the President is constitutionally bound to give assent.   The President's power to withhold assent is therefore a qualified or suspensive veto, not an absolute veto.


**11. With reference to the Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can only contain provisions related to taxation, borrowing, and the custody of the Consolidated Fund.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A Money Bill, as defined in the Constitution, primarily deals with matters concerning taxation, borrowing, and the Consolidated Fund of India.  Statement 1 is largely correct; it focuses on the core aspects of a Money Bill but is not entirely exhaustive, as other clauses related to public funds are also included in the definition. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha has limited powers regarding Money Bills.  It can only make recommendations but cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha's role is purely recommendatory and doesn't affect the ultimate passage of the bill.


**12.  Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for all elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India's structure and functions are key aspects of the Indian electoral system. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Election Commission of India is currently a three-member body, consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners. The single-member commission was the original structure, but it was amended to a multi-member structure. Statement 2 is correct; the Election Commission of India is solely responsible for scheduling and conducting all elections, including general elections and by-elections at all levels (national, state, and local).  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs has no role in this aspect.


**13. With reference to President's Rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly is mandatory upon the imposition of President's Rule.
2.  The removal of the State Council of Ministers is a necessary consequence of President's Rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

President's Rule, under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, is invoked when a state's government fails to function constitutionally.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly is not mandatory upon the imposition of President's Rule.  The President can choose to dissolve the Assembly or allow it to continue functioning under the Governor's rule.  The decision depends on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while the removal of the State Council of Ministers is a common practice, it's not a legally mandated consequence of imposing President's Rule. The Governor assumes the executive functions of the state government, but the Council of Ministers is not necessarily removed in all cases.


**14. Consider the following statements about the features of Indian Federalism:**

1. Indian federalism is characterized by a rigid division of powers between the Centre and the States.
2. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature with unequal representation of States in the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indian federalism is a unique blend of federal and unitary features. Statement 1 is incorrect; the division of powers between the Centre and the States is not entirely rigid.  The Constitution allows for both the Centre and States to legislate on certain subjects (concurrent list), and the Centre has significant powers to intervene in state matters in certain circumstances (e.g., President's Rule). Statement 2 is correct; the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, has unequal representation of States, reflecting a compromise between federal and unitary principles.  While aiming for federal representation, the unequal representation of states in Rajya Sabha prioritizes the larger states.


**15. With reference to the control of Parliament over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.
2.  The Question Hour is a mechanism through which Parliament scrutinizes the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary control over the executive is a fundamental aspect of a parliamentary democracy. Statement 1 is correct; a no-confidence motion allows Parliament to express its lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers, leading to its resignation or a dissolution of the Parliament.  This is a powerful tool for holding the executive accountable. Statement 2 is also correct; the Question Hour provides a platform for members of Parliament to question ministers on various matters, enabling the scrutiny of government policies and actions.  This mechanism contributes to greater transparency and accountability.


**16. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.
2.  Private member's bills are routinely passed into law in the Indian Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Private member's bills are introduced by Members of Parliament (MPs) who are not ministers.  Statement 1 is correct; these bills represent the legislative initiatives of individual MPs, distinct from government-sponsored legislation. Statement 2 is incorrect; the passage of private member's bills is rare in the Indian Parliament.  Government business generally takes precedence, and private member's bills often face time constraints and limited support.  While they play a role in raising important issues, their success in becoming law is exceptional.


**17. Consider the following statements about the parliamentary form of government:**

1. In a parliamentary system, the executive is accountable to the legislature.
2.  A parliamentary system ensures a fixed term for the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The parliamentary form of government is characterized by a close relationship between the executive and the legislature. Statement 1 is correct; the executive branch (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the legislature (Parliament) and can be removed through a vote of no confidence. This ensures accountability. Statement 2 is incorrect; a parliamentary system does *not* guarantee a fixed term for the government.  The government can be dissolved before the completion of its term through a vote of no confidence or by the head of state.  The term is contingent upon maintaining the legislature's confidence.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the cabinet form of government:**

1. The cabinet form of government promotes collective responsibility.
2. The cabinet form of government necessarily leads to faster decision-making.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The cabinet form of government, a hallmark of parliamentary systems, has several key characteristics. Statement 1 is correct; the cabinet operates on the principle of collective responsibility, where all ministers are jointly responsible for government decisions.  This fosters unity and prevents individual ministers from acting independently. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the cabinet system can facilitate decision-making, it doesn't necessarily lead to faster decisions.  The need for consensus among ministers can sometimes slow down the process, especially when dealing with complex or controversial issues.  The efficiency of decision-making depends on various factors, including the political dynamics within the cabinet.


**19. With reference to judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review allows the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive actions.
2. Judicial review empowers the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Judicial review is a fundamental feature of the Indian legal system, ensuring the supremacy of the Constitution. Statement 1 is correct; the judiciary has the power to examine whether laws passed by the legislature or actions taken by the executive are consistent with the Constitution.  If found unconstitutional, these laws or actions can be struck down. Statement 2 is incorrect; judicial review is primarily concerned with the legality of laws and actions, not their wisdom or policy merits.  The judiciary doesn't assess the effectiveness or desirability of government policies; its role is limited to evaluating their constitutionality.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are enforceable by courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are a unique feature of the Indian Constitution, outlining the socio-economic goals of the state.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to follow in formulating its policies, but they do not create legally enforceable rights. Statement 2 is correct; the Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, where the government plays an active role in promoting social and economic welfare, ensuring a basic standard of living and opportunities for all citizens.  They provide a framework for social and economic development.


**21. With reference to the Government of India Act 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced dyarchy at the provincial level.
2. It significantly increased the power of the Indian legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced significant changes in the Indian governance system. Statement 1 is correct; it introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance in provinces, dividing subjects between transferred (under Indian control) and reserved (under British control) subjects. This was a step towards greater Indian participation in governance. Statement 2 is incorrect; although the Act created a bicameral legislature (Central Legislative Assembly and Council of State), it did not significantly increase the power of the Indian legislature. The British government retained substantial control over major policy decisions.


**22. Consider the following statements about the Joint Sitting of Parliament:**

1. A joint sitting can be convened to resolve deadlocks between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on ordinary bills.
2.  A joint sitting can be convened to resolve deadlocks on Money Bills.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution provides for a joint sitting of both houses of Parliament to resolve deadlocks on legislation. Statement 1 is correct; a joint sitting can be convened by the President to resolve disagreements between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on an ordinary bill (except Money Bills).  If the bill is passed by a majority of the members present and voting in the joint sitting, it is deemed passed by both houses. Statement 2 is incorrect; a joint sitting cannot be convened for Money Bills.  The Lok Sabha has the final authority on Money Bills, and the Rajya Sabha's role is limited to making recommendations.


**23. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.
2. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank established by the Government of India. Statement 1 is correct; NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015.  It shifted the focus from centralized planning to cooperative federalism, emphasizing state-level initiatives and collaborative policy-making. Statement 2 is incorrect; NITI Aayog is not a constitutional body; it was established by a resolution of the government, not through a constitutional amendment.  Its functions and structure are defined by government policy, not by the Constitution.


**24. Consider the following statements about the Executive Power of the Union:**

1. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President.
2. The President exercises executive power directly through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President. Statement 1 is correct; this is a fundamental principle of the Indian political system. However, the President doesn't exercise this power directly. Statement 2 is also correct; the President exercises executive power through the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible to the Parliament.  This reflects the parliamentary system of government, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.


**25. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas.
2. The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain northeastern states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth and Sixth Schedules address the special provisions for Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas respectively. Statement 1 is correct; the Fifth Schedule provides for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas, primarily focusing on the welfare and development of Scheduled Tribes in these areas. Statement 2 is also correct; the Sixth Schedule provides for the administration of tribal areas in four northeastern states (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram), giving them a degree of autonomy in local governance.  It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils with specific powers.


**26. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Department of Revenue prepares the Union Budget.
2.  Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial aspect of India's financial system. Statement 1 is correct; the Department of Revenue plays a central role in the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament. While other departments contribute, the Department of Revenue is the primary agency responsible. Statement 2 is also correct; no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary control over public finances, ensuring transparency and accountability.


**27. With reference to the custodian of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is the custodian of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India interprets and upholds the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution's authority and interpretation are crucial aspects of the Indian political system. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the President is the head of state and plays a role in upholding the Constitution, it is not accurate to say that the President alone is the custodian of the Constitution. The concept of a custodian implies a singular entity responsible for safeguarding the Constitution, which is not the case in India's system of checks and balances. Statement 2 is correct; the Supreme Court of India, through its power of judicial review, interprets and safeguards the Constitution.  It ensures that laws and government actions conform to the Constitutional framework.


**28. Consider the following statements about the classical language status:**

1.  The status of a classical language is conferred by the Government of India.
2.  The classical language status provides additional funding for the development and promotion of the language.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India confers the status of a "classical language" on ancient Indian languages that meet specific criteria. Statement 1 is correct; this recognition is based on the language's antiquity, its significant contribution to Indian culture and its having a distinct grammatical structure. Statement 2 is also correct; the classical language status typically leads to increased government funding for the preservation, promotion, and development of the language through various programs and initiatives.  This recognition signifies the importance of preserving India's linguistic heritage.


**29. With reference to the Legislative Council of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Legislative Council can be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly.
2.  The Governor nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad), an upper house in some Indian states, has specific features. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Legislative Council cannot be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly in that state.  This is a constitutional limitation designed to maintain a balance between the two houses. Statement 2 is correct; the Governor nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council from among its members.  This is a constitutional provision that reflects the Governor's role in the state legislature.


**30.  Consider the following statements about the objective of the Panchayati Raj system:**

1.  Panchayati Raj aims to promote financial mobilization at the local level.
2. Panchayati Raj aims to ensure political accountability at the local level.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

The Panchayati Raj system aims to decentralize power and promote local self-governance. Statement 1 is correct; Panchayati Raj institutions are expected to mobilize financial resources at the local level through various means, enhancing their autonomy and capacity for development. Statement 2 is also correct; the system aims to improve political accountability by bringing local governance closer to the people and making local representatives more responsive to their needs.  Regular elections and public participation are key to achieving this accountability.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

District Judges are an integral part of the judicial system. Statement 1 is correct; District Judges are appointed by the Governor of the State in consultation with the High Court.  This reflects the balance between the executive and judicial branches in the appointment process. Statement 2 is also correct; the High Court exercises administrative control over District Judges, including matters of postings, transfers, and disciplinary actions.  This ensures the independence and efficiency of the judicial system at the district level.


**32. Consider the following statements regarding the introduction of a Money Bill in the State Legislature:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced only on the recommendation of the Governor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Money Bills in the State Legislature follow a similar procedure to that at the national level. Statement 1 is correct; a Money Bill can be introduced in the State Legislature only on the recommendation of the Governor.  This ensures that the executive branch is involved in the process of introducing financial legislation. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Governor does not have the power to withhold assent to a Money Bill once it has been passed by the State Legislature.  The Governor is bound to give assent to a Money Bill that has been passed by the State Legislature.


**33. With reference to the Balwantray Mehta Committee, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Balwantray Mehta Committee played a crucial role in shaping the Panchayati Raj system in India. Statement 1 is correct; the committee recommended a three-tier structure for Panchayati Raj, comprising Gram Panchayat (village level), Panchayat Samiti (block level), and Zila Parishad (district level).  This decentralized structure aimed to bring governance closer to the people. Statement 2 is incorrect; the committee recommended that the District Collector should be a non-voting member of the Zila Parishad, not the chairman.  This was to ensure that the administrative and political functions were kept separate.


**34. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj system:**

1. Panchayati Raj is a system of local self-government.
2. Panchayati Raj was first adopted in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.

Statement 1 is correct; Panchayati Raj is a system of rural local self-government, empowering local communities to participate in decision-making and development. Statement 2 is also correct; Panchayati Raj was first adopted in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh in 1959, marking a significant step towards decentralization.  These two states were chosen as pilot states to launch this system.

**1. With reference to the composition of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constituent Assembly was constituted based solely on the recommendations of the Cabinet Mission Plan.
2.  The Assembly included representatives from the princely states, nominated by their respective rulers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cabinet Mission Plan played a significant role in shaping the Constituent Assembly's formation, it wasn't the sole determinant.  The plan proposed a method for electing members but didn't dictate the entire composition.  The process involved elections by provincial assemblies and nominations for princely states.  The initial composition of the Assembly was also influenced by pre-existing political dynamics and negotiations among various Indian groups.

Statement 2 is correct. The princely states, which were not directly under British rule, were given representation in the Constituent Assembly through nominated members. These nominations were made by the rulers of these states, reflecting the unique political status of these entities during the independence process.  This ensured that the future constitution encompassed the interests and concerns of the princely states, even if their representation wasn't directly elected.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the adoption of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Indian Constitution was adopted on January 26, 1950, to commemorate the Purna Swaraj declaration.
2. The Constitution was finalized and adopted by the Constituent Assembly within a single year of its formation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The date of January 26th holds historical significance as it marks the anniversary of the Purna Swaraj declaration (complete independence) made by the Indian National Congress in 1930.  Choosing this date for the adoption of the Constitution symbolized the continuity of the struggle for self-governance and the realization of complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constituent Assembly's work spanned over several years, from its initial formation to the final adoption of the Constitution.  The drafting, debating, and amending of the Constitution involved extensive deliberations and compromises among various sections of the Assembly, a process which extended significantly beyond a single year.


**3. With reference to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble explicitly mentions the establishment of a socialist and secular state.
2.  The Preamble guarantees fundamental rights but doesn't explicitly mention directive principles of state policy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The words "socialist" and "secular" were added to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. This amendment reflected the evolving political and social landscape of India, emphasizing the commitment to socialist goals and secular principles.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Preamble reflects the overall spirit of the Constitution, including the commitment to social and economic justice, it does not explicitly list the Directive Principles of State Policy.  The Directive Principles are separately enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, outlining the socio-economic goals the state should strive to achieve.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Rights:**

1.  The right to education is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original Constitution.
2.  The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to education, while a crucial aspect of human development, was not explicitly included as a Fundamental Right in the original Constitution. It was later incorporated through the 86th Amendment Act of 2002, making it a Fundamental Right for children aged 6-14.  The original Constitution focused primarily on civil and political rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The right to privacy, while implicitly protected under Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty), was not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original text. The Supreme Court of India later recognized it as a fundamental right in the Puttaswamy case.


**5. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is that the Directive Principles are not justiciable.  They are non-enforceable by courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies aimed at achieving socio-economic justice and welfare.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by outlining the state's responsibilities in promoting social and economic welfare. These include provisions related to education, healthcare, work, and social security, reflecting the commitment to a society where the state actively works to improve the well-being of its citizens.



**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Union and its territory:**

1. The Parliament's power to alter the boundaries of states is absolute and unrestricted.
2.  The Parliament can create new states without the consent of the existing states involved.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Parliament has the power to form new states and alter the boundaries of existing ones (Article 3), this power is not absolute.  There are certain limitations and procedures that must be followed.  For example, the Parliament must consider the views of the affected state legislatures and the President's assent is required for any such action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Parliament can create new states, it is not solely within its discretion to do so without considering the views of the states involved.  The process necessitates the consideration of the affected states' opinions and may require the approval of their legislatures, though this is not always mandatory.


**7. With reference to Indian Citizenship, consider the following statements:**

1.  Citizenship by descent is available only to those born in India after the commencement of the Constitution.
2.  A person of Indian origin living abroad can acquire Indian citizenship through registration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Citizenship by descent is available to individuals born outside India to parents who are Indian citizens.  The provision extends to those born before and after the commencement of the Constitution, provided certain conditions regarding the parents' citizenship and residence are fulfilled.

Statement 2 is correct. The Citizenship Act, 1955, provides for several ways to acquire Indian citizenship, including registration.  This is a common pathway for individuals of Indian origin who have resided abroad for a significant period but wish to regain Indian citizenship.  The conditions for registration are specified in the Act.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the right to equality:**

1. Article 15 prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth only in public employment.
2. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 15 prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth in various spheres, not limited to just public employment.  It encompasses access to public places, shops, restaurants, educational institutions, and other areas of public life.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 16 explicitly guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.  This means that all citizens should have equal chances for government jobs without any discrimination based on factors such as religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.


**9. With reference to the right to freedom, consider the following statements:**

1. The freedom of speech and expression includes the freedom of the press.
2. The freedom of speech and expression is absolute and unrestricted.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The freedom of speech and expression, guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a), is widely interpreted to encompass the freedom of the press.  This is crucial for a democratic society where the free flow of information and diverse viewpoints are essential.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The freedom of speech and expression is not absolute.  Reasonable restrictions can be imposed by the state in the interest of public order, security, decency, or morality.  These restrictions are subject to judicial review to ensure they are not disproportionate or arbitrary.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the right against exploitation:**

1.  Prohibition of child labour is covered under Article 23 of the Constitution.
2.  Abolition of untouchability is covered under Article 17 of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The prohibition of child labour is specifically addressed under Article 24 of the Constitution, which prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in factories, mines, and other hazardous occupations.  Article 23 deals with the prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 17 of the Constitution abolishes untouchability and declares it to be an offence punishable by law.  This provision aims to eradicate the discriminatory practices associated with the caste system, promoting social equality and dignity.


**11. With reference to the right to freedom of religion, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 25 guarantees the freedom to manage religious affairs.
2. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in educational institutions maintained by the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom to manage religious affairs, including the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and conduct religious practices. This freedom is subject to public order, morality, and health.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in educational institutions wholly maintained by the state.  This provision aims to ensure secular education and prevent the imposition of any particular religion on students in state-funded institutions.  However, this prohibition doesn't extend to educational institutions receiving state aid or those established by religious minorities.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the right to constitutional remedies:**

1.  Article 32 empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights.
2.  The right to constitutional remedies is not a fundamental right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 32 is a crucial provision in the Constitution, granting the Supreme Court the power to issue writs (habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari) for the enforcement of fundamental rights.  This empowers citizens to directly approach the Supreme Court if their fundamental rights are violated.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The right to constitutional remedies, enshrined in Article 32, is itself considered a fundamental right.  It's a safeguard ensuring that citizens have access to judicial redress if their fundamental rights are violated.  This right is considered the heart and soul of the Constitution's guarantee of fundamental rights.


**13. With reference to the amendment of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. An amendment to the Constitution requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  An amendment to the Constitution requires the ratification of half of the state legislatures.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The procedure for amending the Constitution is laid down in Article 368.  Most amendments require a special majority in both Houses of Parliament—a majority of the total membership of each House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some amendments may require ratification by state legislatures, it's not a requirement for all amendments.  The Constitution specifies which amendments require state legislative ratification; it does not automatically apply to all amendments.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the basic structure doctrine:**

1. The basic structure doctrine was established by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
2. The doctrine permits amendments to the Constitution that alter the basic structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The basic structure doctrine, which holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or abolished through amendments, was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case (1973).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The basic structure doctrine explicitly prohibits amendments that alter or destroy the basic features of the Constitution. This doctrine provides a check on the Parliament's amending power, ensuring that fundamental aspects of the Constitution remain protected.  The Court determines what constitutes the basic structure on a case-by-case basis.


**15. With reference to the parliamentary system of government, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive is responsible to the legislature.
2. The head of state is also the head of government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A defining feature of the parliamentary system is that the executive (the government) is responsible to the legislature (the Parliament).  This means that the government must retain the confidence of the legislature; if it loses this confidence, it must resign.  This ensures accountability of the executive to the elected representatives of the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In a parliamentary system, there is a clear distinction between the head of state (who is largely a ceremonial figure like the President in India) and the head of government (who is the actual executive authority, like the Prime Minister in India).  The head of state is usually not involved in the daily functioning of the government.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the federal system in India:**

1. India has a unitary system with some federal features.
2. The Indian federal system allows for the creation of new states by the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While India is a federal system, it leans towards a unitary system in practice due to several factors, including the strong position of the central government, the presence of All-India Services, and the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution.  The description as a "unitary system with some federal features" reflects this nuanced reality.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 of the Constitution explicitly grants the Parliament the power to form new states and alter the boundaries of existing ones.  This reflects the flexibility of the Indian federal system and the central government's role in shaping the structure of the federation.


**17. With reference to Centre-State relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The residuary powers are vested with the Union Government.
2. The Union Government can legislate on any subject in the State List in the national interest.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The residuary powers, which are those powers not explicitly assigned to either the Union or the States in the Constitution, are vested with the Union Government.  This ensures that the Union has the authority to legislate on matters that may arise in the future or that are not specifically covered in the lists.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution grants the Parliament the power to legislate on any subject in the State List if it deems it necessary in the national interest.  This power is subject to certain conditions, such as the passage of a resolution by the Parliament, but it allows the Union Government to address matters of national importance that may fall under the purview of the States.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding inter-state relations:**

1. Inter-state water disputes are resolved by the Supreme Court of India.
2. The Zonal Councils are constitutional bodies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention a mechanism for resolving inter-state water disputes, the Supreme Court has established its jurisdiction in such matters. The Court acts as the final arbiter in these disputes, often appointing tribunals to investigate and make recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Zonal Councils are not constitutional bodies. They were established by the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, to promote co-operation and coordination among states within a particular zone.  Their composition and functions are defined by executive actions, not by the Constitution itself.


**19. With reference to emergency provisions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can declare a national emergency only on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet.
2.  During a national emergency, fundamental rights can be suspended.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 352 of the Constitution empowers the President to declare a national emergency, but this power is exercised only on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet.  This ensures that the decision to declare an emergency is not taken arbitrarily but is based on the advice of the executive branch.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 359 of the Constitution allows the President to suspend the enforcement of certain fundamental rights during a national emergency.  This provision is intended to enable the government to effectively deal with the emergency situation, but the suspension is subject to judicial review and is not unlimited.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1.  The President is elected by the members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies.
2.  The President can be removed from office through impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies.  The voting system is indirect, with each MLA and MP having a weighted vote based on the population of their respective states.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution provides for the removal of the President through impeachment.  This process involves a resolution passed by a special majority in both Houses of Parliament, alleging violation of the Constitution.  The process is similar to that of removing a Supreme Court judge.


**21. With reference to the Vice-President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vice-President is elected by the members of both Houses of Parliament.
2. The Vice-President acts as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vice-President is elected by an electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament.  This is a similar electoral college to the one that elects the President, though the voting process may have subtle variations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vice-President, in addition to his/her other constitutional duties, automatically becomes the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  This role ensures the smooth functioning of the Upper House of Parliament and provides a significant position for the Vice-President in the parliamentary system.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the Prime Minister of India:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President.
2. The Prime Minister holds office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Prime Minister is the head of the government and wields significant executive power, he/she is formally appointed by the President.  The President's role in this appointment is largely ceremonial, as the President typically appoints the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  Although the Prime Minister is the leader of the government, he/she holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can dismiss the Prime Minister if the latter loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha or if other extraordinary circumstances warrant such action.  This provision reflects the President's position as the nominal head of state.


**23. With reference to the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Council of Ministers is appointed by the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of the parliamentary system is the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of Parliament).  This means that the entire Council must resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  This mechanism ensures the accountability of the executive to the legislature.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President appoints the Council of Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister.  While the Prime Minister selects the ministers, the formal appointment remains with the President.  This reflects the President's constitutional role as the head of state.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (the Upper House) does not have the power to reject a Money Bill.  While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations regarding the Money Bill, the Lok Sabha (the Lower House) is not obligated to accept these recommendations.  This reflects the special status of Money Bills related to financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations, but it cannot amend a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills, reflecting the dominance of the Lower House in financial matters.


**25. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States.
2. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction in cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union Government and one or more States, or between two or more States.  This original jurisdiction reflects the Supreme Court's role in resolving inter-state and Centre-State conflicts, ensuring the smooth functioning of the federal system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court has extensive appellate jurisdiction, including the power to hear appeals against decisions of High Courts involving questions of constitutional interpretation.  This appellate jurisdiction ensures that the interpretation and application of the Constitution remain consistent across different courts and protects the integrity of the Constitution.


**26. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is an independent constitutional authority appointed by the President of India.  This ensures the independence and impartiality of the auditing function.  The CAG's independence from the executive branch is crucial for maintaining financial accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union Government and the State Governments.  This comprehensive auditing function ensures financial transparency and accountability at both the central and state levels.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures.


**27. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  While it has previously had multiple members, the current structure is a single Chief Election Commissioner assisted by Election Commissioners.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections at all levels.  This includes deciding the election schedule, overseeing the nomination process, and managing the polling and counting of votes.  The Commission's independence is vital for ensuring a democratic process.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj system:**

1. The Panchayati Raj system was established through a constitutional amendment.
2. All states are mandated to have a three-tier Panchayati Raj system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayati Raj system, which aims to decentralize power to local levels, was established through the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.  This amendment added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats, and made provisions for their establishment and functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act recommends a three-tier system (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad), it is not mandatory for all states.  The structure and number of tiers may vary based on the specific needs and conditions of each state.  Smaller states may opt for a two-tier structure.


**29. With reference to the Municipalities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Municipalities were established through a constitutional amendment.
2. All states are mandated to have a three-tier Municipal system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Similar to the Panchayati Raj system, the establishment of Municipalities was also brought about through a constitutional amendment—the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992. This amendment added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with Municipalities, and made provisions for their constitution and functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 74th Amendment Act recommends a three-tier system, it is not compulsory for all states. The specific structure and number of tiers of urban local government are left to the discretion of individual states to adapt to their particular needs and circumstances.


**30. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a state:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor can be removed from office by the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. This reflects the hierarchical relationship between the Union and the States in the Indian federal system.  The President's appointment of the Governor ensures that the appointee aligns with the national interests and policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to remove a Governor from office.  While the grounds for removal are not explicitly defined, the President can dismiss a Governor if deemed necessary.  This power is a reflection of the President's role as the nominal head of the Union and the power of the Centre to maintain stability in the states.


**31. With reference to the state legislature, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Legislative Assembly is dissolved by the Governor.
2. The State Legislative Council cannot be dissolved.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The State Legislative Assembly, being the lower house of the state legislature, is subject to dissolution by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister.  This is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system, allowing for the government's accountability to the legislature.

Statement 2 is correct. Unlike the State Legislative Assembly, the State Legislative Council (the upper house, which exists only in some states) is a permanent body and cannot be dissolved.  The members of the Legislative Council serve for fixed terms, ensuring continuity and stability in the upper house.


**32. Consider the following statements regarding the High Courts in India:**

1.  High Courts are established by the Parliament.
2.  High Courts have original and appellate jurisdiction.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Constitution provides for the establishment of High Courts, the Parliament has the power to establish new High Courts and to define their jurisdiction through legislation.  This reflects the Parliament's role in shaping the judicial structure within the country.

Statement 2 is correct. High Courts in India exercise both original and appellate jurisdiction.  Original jurisdiction means they can hear cases in the first instance, while appellate jurisdiction means they can hear appeals against decisions of lower courts.  This dual jurisdiction makes High Courts crucial components of the judicial system.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body constituted under Article 324 of the Indian Constitution, and its composition is determined by the Parliament.
2. The Election Commission of India's jurisdiction extends to the conduct of elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions and the Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Constitution.  While the Constitution outlines its basic structure,  Parliament has the power to make laws further defining its composition and powers. The number of members (currently three) isn't explicitly fixed by the Constitution itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECI's jurisdiction primarily covers elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.  While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments empowered States to establish State Election Commissions to conduct panchayat and municipal elections respectively, these are separate entities. The ECI does not directly supervise these elections.  The question attempts to mislead by linking the ECI's broad role in democratic processes with direct control over all elections at the local level.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly grants residuary powers to the states, promoting a decentralized governance structure.
2. The Rajya Sabha, representing the states, plays a crucial role in ensuring inter-state cooperation and coordination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution vests residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to the Union or States) with the Union government (Article 248). This is a key feature distinguishing the Indian federal system from some others where residuary powers might rest with the states. The statement attempts to reverse the actual constitutional arrangement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's composition, with members representing states, facilitates inter-state dialogue and cooperation on matters of common concern.  Its role in approving certain legislative and executive actions also contributes to federal balance.  The statement accurately reflects a key function of the Rajya Sabha within the Indian federal framework.


**3. With reference to the President's Rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed only after the State Legislative Assembly has been dissolved.
2. The imposition of President's rule automatically leads to the suspension of fundamental rights in the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not a mandatory prerequisite. The President can impose the rule even without prior dissolution, depending on the specific circumstances justifying the action.  The statement incorrectly presents a necessary condition for the imposition of President's rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The imposition of President's rule does not automatically suspend fundamental rights.  While certain rights might be curtailed in exceptional circumstances (during an emergency under Article 352), this is separate and not inherent in Article 356. The statement conflates the implications of President's rule with those of a national emergency.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliament:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament but must be passed by the Lok Sabha first.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay, not reject, a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Although the Constitution doesn't explicitly prohibit introducing a Money Bill in the Rajya Sabha, convention and the spirit of the Constitution dictate that it originates in the Lok Sabha.  The Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters necessitates its prior consideration and passage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's power regarding Money Bills is limited to recommending amendments. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations. The Rajya Sabha cannot ultimately veto a Money Bill. The statement accurately reflects the Rajya Sabha's restricted role in the passage of Money Bills.


**5. With reference to the concept of Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution as a power vested solely in the Supreme Court.
2. The doctrine of "Basic Structure" limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, thereby safeguarding judicial review.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court exercises judicial review, the Constitution doesn't explicitly grant this power.  It's a power derived from the Court's interpretation of the Constitution and its role as the final arbiter of constitutional matters.  The statement incorrectly suggests an explicit constitutional provision for judicial review.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Basic Structure" doctrine, established through Supreme Court judgments, restricts the Parliament's amending power to prevent fundamental alterations to the core principles of the Constitution.  This implicitly protects the Court's power of judicial review as a crucial element of that basic structure.  The statement correctly reflects the interplay between judicial review and the Basic Structure doctrine.



**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by guiding the state's socioeconomic policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles are non-justiciable; they are not directly enforceable in courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to frame its policies but do not confer legally enforceable rights on citizens. The statement misrepresents the legal nature of the Directive Principles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to create a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens. They guide the state's actions in areas such as education, healthcare, and social security.  The statement accurately reflects the fundamental purpose of the Directive Principles.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Federal System:**

1.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India, and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule allows both the Union and State Legislatures to make laws on the same subject.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governors of states, and they hold office during the pleasure of the President.  This aspect reflects the Union's influence over state governments within the federal framework.  The statement accurately describes the appointment and tenure of Governors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Concurrent List (Seventh Schedule) enables both the Union and State Legislatures to enact laws on specified subjects.  In case of conflict, Union laws prevail (Article 254).  The statement correctly identifies the function of the Concurrent List in the Indian federal system.


**8. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Education has been included in the list of Fundamental Rights through a constitutional amendment.
2.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original text of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Education (RTE) was incorporated as a Fundamental Right under Article 21A through the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002.  The statement accurately reflects this constitutional development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Right to Privacy, while now recognized as a fundamental right flowing from Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty), wasn't explicitly mentioned in the original Constitution.  The Supreme Court's judgments have established its constitutional protection. The statement misrepresents the historical context of the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Judiciary:**

1.  The Supreme Court of India can issue writs only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
2.  High Courts in India have both original and appellate jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court frequently uses writ jurisdiction to protect Fundamental Rights, its writ jurisdiction extends beyond this.  It can issue writs for other purposes as well, as empowered by the Constitution. The statement wrongly restricts the scope of the Supreme Court's writ powers.

Statement 2 is correct. High Courts in India possess both original jurisdiction (hearing cases in the first instance) and appellate jurisdiction (hearing appeals from lower courts).  This dual jurisdiction is a key feature of their structure and function. The statement accurately describes the jurisdictional scope of High Courts.


**10. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lok Sabha can be dissolved by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2.  A Joint Session of both Houses of Parliament can be convened only when there is a deadlock on a non-Money Bill.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha (Article 85). This is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system of government in India. The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A Joint Session of Parliament (Article 108) can be convened to resolve deadlocks on both Money Bills and non-Money Bills.  The statement incorrectly limits the circumstances under which a Joint Session can be held.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Preamble to the Constitution declares India to be a "Socialist Secular Democratic Republic".
2. The concept of a Welfare State is explicitly mentioned in the Fundamental Rights section of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution describes India as a "Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic". These words were added or amended during the 42nd Amendment in 1976. The statement accurately reflects the content of the Preamble.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of a Welfare State isn't explicitly mentioned in the Fundamental Rights section. It's primarily reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy, which guide the state towards creating a welfare society. The statement incorrectly associates the Welfare State concept with Fundamental Rights.


**12. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1.  These amendments mandated the establishment of Panchayati Raj institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2. These amendments provided for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in municipalities, proportional to their population in the municipal area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act (Panchayats) mandated a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj at the village, intermediate, and district levels (where applicable).  The statement correctly reflects this key provision of the amendment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 74th Amendment Act (Municipalities) included provisions for reserving seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in municipalities, in proportion to their population in the municipal area. The statement accurately reflects a crucial aspect of the 74th Amendment.

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of certain other bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG is appointed by the President but enjoys a high degree of independence and security of tenure.  They cannot be removed except through impeachment. The statement incorrectly describes the CAG's tenure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of certain other bodies specified by the Constitution or Parliament.  This audit function is crucial for ensuring financial accountability and transparency in government operations. The statement accurately reflects the CAG's audit responsibilities.

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC has the power to punish individuals or organizations found guilty of human rights violations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established through legislation (Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993), not a constitutional body.  Its existence and powers are derived from a law passed by Parliament, not directly from the Constitution. The statement incorrectly classifies the NHRC as a constitutional body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC doesn't have the power to punish human rights violators directly. It can investigate complaints, make recommendations, and report its findings, but it cannot impose penalties.  Judicial or other bodies handle the actual punishment.  The statement misrepresents the NHRC's powers and limitations.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget in India:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.
2.  The President of India approves and signs the Union Budget before it becomes law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Finance Minister presents the annual Union Budget to both Houses of Parliament. This is a crucial event in the Indian fiscal year. The statement accurately reflects this established practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's assent is required for a Money Bill (which includes the Union Budget) to become law, the President doesn't "approve" the Budget's contents. The President's role is primarily a formal one, reflecting the constitutional requirement of presidential assent for legislation.  The statement mistakenly attributes a substantive role to the President in the Budget's approval process.


**16. With reference to the Union and State Governments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Government levies and collects all taxes on income.
2. The State Governments have the power to levy and collect taxes on sales within their respective states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Union Government levies income tax, the actual collection process involves both the Union and State Governments, as per the division of powers and revenue-sharing arrangements outlined in the Constitution.  The statement oversimplifies the complex tax collection system.

Statement 2 is correct. State Governments have the power to levy and collect taxes on sales within their jurisdictions. This is a significant source of revenue for state governments. The statement accurately reflects the states' taxation powers.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of religion to all citizens.
2.  The Constitution of India prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 15 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. This is a fundamental principle of equality enshrined in the Constitution. The statement accurately reflects this anti-discrimination provision.


**18. With reference to the working of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over the meetings of the Lok Sabha and the Joint Sittings of Parliament.
2. The Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha presides over the meetings of the Rajya Sabha.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over the meetings of the Lok Sabha and, in the case of a joint sitting, presides over the joint sitting of Parliament.  The statement accurately describes the Speaker's role.

**19. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Constitution provides for the establishment of a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, introduced provisions for a three-tier Panchayati Raj system (village, intermediate, and district levels), though the exact structure can vary based on state-specific circumstances. The statement accurately reflects the constitutional provision for a three-tier system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Constitution advocates for regular elections, it doesn't mandate a specific five-year term.  State laws and election commissions determine the exact election schedule. The statement mistakenly asserts a fixed five-year term for Panchayati Raj elections.


**20. With reference to the Indian Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility holds the entire Council of Ministers accountable to the Lok Sabha.  A vote of no confidence against the government implies a loss of confidence in the entire Council of Ministers, not just the Prime Minister. The statement accurately reflects this key aspect of parliamentary democracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints the Prime Minister, and on the Prime Minister's advice, appoints other ministers. This process reflects the constitutional relationship between the executive and the legislature. The statement accurately describes the ministerial appointment process.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through a constitutional amendment.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976.  They were incorporated in Part IV-A of the Constitution. The statement accurately reflects this historical development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable.  There are no direct legal penalties for failing to fulfill them.  They serve as moral guidelines for citizens.  The statement incorrectly suggests legal enforceability for Fundamental Duties.


**22. With reference to the Governor of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to nominate members to the Legislative Council (if one exists).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 2 is correct.  Governors have the power to nominate a certain number of members to the Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) in states that have bicameral legislatures.  This power is usually exercised to include experts or representatives from specific sections of society. The statement accurately reflects the Governor's nominating power.


**23. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's power over Money Bills is limited to recommending amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Rajya Sabha cannot ultimately reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. The statement accurately reflects this constitutional restriction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and recommending amendments. The statement incorrectly assigns the power to initiate a Money Bill to the Rajya Sabha.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court and the final court of appeal in all matters, both civil and criminal.  Its judgments are binding on all other courts in the country. The statement accurately reflects the Supreme Court's position as the highest court.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in specific matters, primarily disputes between the Union and States, or between States.  This original jurisdiction is exclusive, meaning only the Supreme Court can hear these cases initially. The statement correctly identifies the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.


**25. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Part XIV of the Constitution.
2. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to all government posts in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UPSC conducts crucial recruitment examinations for many key positions in the Union and State Governments, it is not responsible for all government posts.  Many recruitments are handled by other bodies at the state or departmental levels. The statement incorrectly claims the UPSC handles all government recruitments.


**26. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Governors of states. This appointment reflects the central government's influence on state governments. The statement accurately describes the Governor's appointment.


**28. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While initially, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely protected from judicial review, the Supreme Court's decision in I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu, 2007, clarified that post-24 April 1973 entries are subject to judicial review if they violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution. The statement incorrectly asserts complete immunity from judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ninth Schedule was created by the First Constitutional Amendment Act, 1951, not earlier. The statement is factually incorrect regarding the amendment.


**29. Consider the following statements about the Indian Parliament:**

1. The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution.
2. The Parliament cannot amend the Basic Structure of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution through the prescribed procedure (Article 368). The statement correctly reflects Parliament's amending power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's "Basic Structure" doctrine limits Parliament's amending power.  It holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or abolished through amendments.  This doctrine protects the core principles of the Constitution. The statement accurately reflects the limitations imposed by the Basic Structure doctrine.


**30. With reference to the State Legislative Assemblies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The minimum age for membership of a State Legislative Assembly is 25 years.
2.  The State Legislative Assembly can be dissolved by the Governor of that State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The minimum age for membership in a State Legislative Assembly is 25 years, as specified in the Constitution. The statement accurately reflects the constitutional requirement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Governor can recommend the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly to the President, the Governor doesn't have the power to dissolve the Assembly unilaterally. The President, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers, typically dissolves the Assembly. The statement incorrectly attributes the power of dissolution solely to the Governor.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the President's rule in a state, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can impose President's rule only when the state government fails to comply with the directions of the Union government.
2.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the state legislative assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the failure of a state government to comply with Union directives can be a ground for imposing President's rule (Article 356), it's not the only ground.  The President can also impose President's rule if the state government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. This is a broader criterion encompassing various scenarios beyond mere non-compliance with Union directions.  The situation must be such that the constitutional machinery of the state has broken down.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule does *not* automatically dissolve the state legislative assembly.  While the assembly can be dissolved under Article 356, it's not mandatory.  The President can choose to keep the assembly functioning or dissolve it depending on the circumstances and the assessment of the situation in the state.  The decision rests with the President's discretion and isn't an automatic consequence of the imposition of President's rule.  This flexibility allows for a nuanced response based on the specific situation in the state.


**2. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union Budget is presented by the Union Finance Minister in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union government in matters of financial allocation to the states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, detailing the government's financial plans for the upcoming fiscal year, is presented by the Union Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). It's then transmitted to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) for its consideration. Although the Rajya Sabha cannot amend the Budget, it can discuss and suggest changes.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations regarding the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the states, and the principles governing grants-in-aid to states, are not legally binding on the Union government.  While the government is expected to seriously consider the recommendations, it has the discretion to accept or reject them, or to modify them based on its own assessment of the financial situation.  This reflects the inherent flexibility in the Indian financial federal structure.


**3. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can dismiss a state council of ministers if they lose the confidence of the state legislative assembly.
2. The Governor appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court of the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key power of the Governor is to dismiss a state council of ministers if they lose the confidence of the state legislative assembly. This is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system, ensuring the executive remains accountable to the legislature.  The Governor acts on the advice of the Chief Minister and the council of ministers.  However, in exceptional circumstances,  the Governor can exercise his discretion to dismiss a Council of Ministers even if they haven't formally lost a vote of confidence.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor plays a role in the appointment of High Court judges, he/she does *not* appoint the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice of a High Court is appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the state concerned.  The Governor's role is primarily consultative.  This process underscores the importance of maintaining the independence of the judiciary.


**4. With reference to the Indian judicial system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction is binding on the government.
2.  The High Courts have the power of judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction, under Article 143 of the Constitution, allows the President to seek the Court's opinion on matters of law or fact of public importance. However, the Supreme Court's opinion in such cases is purely advisory and non-binding on the government.  The government is free to accept or reject the advice.


Statement 2 is correct.  High Courts in India possess the power of judicial review, enabling them to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by the state legislature and actions taken by the state executive.  If a law or action is found to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the High Court can declare it void.  This power is vital in upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.


**5. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has a fixed number of members, with representation from each state based on its population.
2. One-third of the Rajya Sabha members retire every two years.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha has a maximum limit on the total number of members (250), it does not have a fixed number.  The representation from each state is based on its population, but the total number can vary as the number of seats allotted to each state changes.  The actual number of members is less than the maximum limit of 250, with 12 members nominated by the President.  


Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body, unlike the Lok Sabha, which is dissolved every five years. However, it is not a static body. One-third of its members retire every two years, ensuring a continuous process of renewal and bringing in fresh perspectives. This staggered retirement system ensures continuity and stability while also preventing any single group from dominating the house for prolonged periods.



**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2.  They aim to establish a socialistic pattern of society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are *not* justiciable. This means they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state in formulating its policies and legislation aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  The non-justiciable nature of these principles reflects a balance between the need for social and economic progress and the limitations of judicial enforcement in these complex areas.


Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles, while not legally binding, provide a framework for the state to work towards establishing a socialistic pattern of society.  This involves promoting social and economic equality, welfare of the people, and reducing disparities.  The inclusion of these principles reflects the Constitution's commitment to social justice and economic development.  The socialistic pattern is a broad objective, not a rigid blueprint.


**7. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights.
2. The Parliament can create new states and alter the boundaries of existing states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights. This power is enshrined in Article 368 of the Constitution. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that certain aspects of the Constitution, such as the basic structure, cannot be amended.


Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament possesses the power to form new states and modify the boundaries of existing ones. This power stems from Article 3 of the Constitution.  This power is crucial for administrative efficiency and responding to evolving demographic and political realities.  However, such alterations require due consideration of several factors, including the interests of the affected populations and the maintenance of administrative efficiency.


**8. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2.  Panchayati Raj Institutions have the power to levy taxes and other sources of revenue.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) does not mandate a uniform three-tier Panchayati Raj system across all states. The structure and number of tiers can vary depending on the specific conditions of each state.  The Act provides a framework, but it allows for flexibility based on the needs and characteristics of different states.


Statement 2 is correct. Panchayati Raj Institutions are empowered to levy, collect, and appropriate certain taxes, duties, tolls, and fees. This power is crucial for their financial autonomy and enables them to function effectively and independently. The specific taxes they can levy, however, vary from state to state.  This financial autonomy is a crucial component of empowering these institutions to manage local affairs.


**9. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is appointed by the President. This appointment highlights the importance of ensuring the independence of the CAG's office. The CAG is a crucial institution responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and state governments, as well as other public bodies.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend beyond the Union government. The CAG also audits the accounts of state governments, Union Territories, and various other public sector undertakings.  This broader scope ensures comprehensive financial accountability across all levels of government and public bodies.  The CAG's reports provide crucial insights into the financial health and management of public funds.


**10. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC can issue directions to the government on human rights violations.
2.  The NHRC's recommendations are binding on the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHRC, a statutory body, has the power to investigate human rights violations and issue directions or recommendations to the government.  These directions, while not legally binding in the strictest sense, carry significant moral weight and exert considerable influence on government policy and actions.  The NHRC's investigations and recommendations play a crucial role in ensuring accountability for human rights violations.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recommendations made by the NHRC, while highly influential, are not legally binding on the government. The government is expected to consider the recommendations seriously, but it retains the discretion to accept, reject, or modify them. This reflects the balance between the NHRC’s role in protecting human rights and the government's responsibility for governance.  The government's response to NHRC recommendations is a matter of public record and scrutiny.



**1. With reference to the Advocates entitled to practice before the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. Senior Advocates can appear in the Supreme Court without an Advocate-on-Record.
2. Advocates-on-Record are the only advocates entitled to file documents before the Supreme Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that a Senior Advocate is *not* entitled to appear without an Advocate-on-Record in the Supreme Court.  This highlights a crucial aspect of the Supreme Court's procedural framework, emphasizing the distinct roles and responsibilities within the legal profession practicing before the highest court of the land.  The requirement of an Advocate-on-Record underscores the importance of maintaining a structured and organized system for managing case filings and appearances.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that only Advocates-on-Record are authorized to file any matter or document before the Supreme Court. This underlines their unique position in the Supreme Court's functioning.  This restriction is not arbitrary; it ensures a controlled and efficient process for handling the court's large volume of cases.  Other advocates can appear and argue but cannot file documents, underscoring the specialized role of the Advocate-on-Record.


**2. With reference to the comparison between the Indian and American Supreme Courts, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Supreme Court possesses advisory jurisdiction, while the American Supreme Court does not.
2. The American Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends beyond federal cases to encompass matters related to naval forces and ambassadors, unlike the Indian Supreme Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The comparative table provided directly indicates that the Indian Supreme Court has advisory jurisdiction, a power not held by its American counterpart. This difference reflects variations in the constitutional frameworks and the respective roles of the judiciaries within their political systems.  The Indian Supreme Court's advisory role allows the President to seek its opinion on significant legal questions, enhancing the government's access to expert legal advice.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The table clearly shows that the American Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is broader, encompassing cases involving naval forces, maritime activities, and ambassadors, areas not included within the Indian Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. This difference stems from the distinct structures of the two countries' legal systems and their approaches to the delineation of federal and state/national powers.  The broader original jurisdiction of the American Supreme Court reflects its role in resolving disputes concerning a wider range of subjects involving the federal government.


**3. With reference to the articles related to the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 137 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments.
2. Article 143 of the Constitution empowers the President to consult the Supreme Court on questions of law or fact.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Table 26.2 explicitly lists Article 137 as dealing with the Supreme Court's power to review its judgments or orders. This power is a significant aspect of the Supreme Court's role in ensuring the consistency and accuracy of its decisions.  The ability to review its own judgments allows for the correction of errors and the adaptation of legal interpretations over time.

Statement 2 is also correct. Table 26.2 shows that Article 143 outlines the President's power to seek the Supreme Court's opinion on questions of law or fact.  This advisory jurisdiction provides a mechanism for the executive branch to obtain authoritative legal opinions on complex or contentious issues, enhancing the clarity and legitimacy of government decisions.  The advisory nature of this consultation does not bind the President but offers valuable insight.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the judicial review:**

1. The doctrine of judicial review originated in India and was later adopted by the USA.
2. In India, the power of judicial review is considered a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be curtailed by a constitutional amendment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the doctrine of judicial review originated and developed in the USA, with the landmark case of *Marbury v. Madison* (1803).  India, on the other hand, incorporated the power of judicial review into its Constitution.  This difference in origin highlights the distinct historical and constitutional developments of the two nations' legal systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the Supreme Court of India has declared the power of judicial review as a basic feature of the Constitution, meaning it cannot be removed even through a constitutional amendment. This is a crucial aspect of India's constitutional framework, safeguarding the judiciary's role in upholding the Constitution's supremacy.  This protection reinforces the principle of checks and balances within the Indian government.


**5. With reference to the High Courts in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President appoints every judge of a High Court, including the Chief Justice.
2.  High Courts can entertain petitions related to Public Interest Litigation (PIL).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints High Court judges, the process involves consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the concerned state (and Governors of all states involved in the case of a common High Court).  The text explicitly describes this consultative process, emphasizing the collaborative nature of judicial appointments.  This highlights the constitutional framework designed to balance executive and judicial roles in the appointment process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that High Courts may accept petitions related to Public Interest Litigation. This reflects the High Courts' significant role in protecting citizen rights and addressing issues of public concern.  The acceptance of PILs underscores the evolving role of the judiciary in addressing societal problems and ensuring access to justice for all.


**6. With reference to the  National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NJAC was established to replace the Collegium system for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts.
2. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the NJAC Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates that the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the NJAC Act aimed to replace the Collegium system with the NJAC. This reflects a significant attempt to reform the judicial appointment process.  The establishment of the NJAC was a controversial move, sparking debate about the balance between executive and judicial influence in judicial appointments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Supreme Court declared both the 99th Constitutional Amendment and the NJAC Act unconstitutional and void in 2015. This decision reinstated the Collegium system, highlighting the Supreme Court's role in protecting the independence of the judiciary. The invalidation of the NJAC reflects the Court's interpretation of the constitutional principles related to judicial independence and the separation of powers.


**7. With reference to the jurisdiction of High Courts, consider the following statements:**

1. High Courts have appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters, exceeding their original jurisdiction.
2. High Courts possess supervisory jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals within their territorial jurisdiction, including military courts.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that High Courts possess a broader appellate jurisdiction than their original jurisdiction, covering both civil and criminal cases. This emphasizes the hierarchical structure of the judicial system, with High Courts serving as appellate courts for lower courts within their jurisdiction.  The extensive appellate jurisdiction of High Courts is crucial for ensuring fair and consistent application of laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifically clarifies that the supervisory jurisdiction of High Courts excludes military courts or tribunals. This exception reflects the distinct nature of military justice and the need to maintain separate disciplinary mechanisms within the armed forces.  The exclusion of military courts from High Court supervision is a significant aspect of the relationship between the civilian and military justice systems.


**8. With reference to the power of judicial review exercised by High Courts, consider the following statements:**

1. High Courts can examine the constitutionality of central laws but not state laws.
2. The 42nd Amendment Act permanently curtailed the High Courts' power of judicial review over central laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that High Courts can examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders from *both* the central and state governments. This broad power of judicial review is a cornerstone of the Indian judicial system, ensuring the supremacy of the Constitution. The ability to review both central and state actions ensures a uniform application of constitutional principles across all levels of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explains that the 42nd Amendment Act *did* curtail the High Courts' power of judicial review over central laws but that this was *reversed* by the 43rd Amendment Act.  This demonstrates the dynamic nature of constitutional interpretation and the potential for legislative adjustments to the judiciary's powers. The subsequent reversal highlights the importance of maintaining the judiciary's ability to check the constitutionality of all laws.


**9.  Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's powers:**

1. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights.
2. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction and powers concerning matters in the Union List can be expanded by Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court's original writ jurisdiction under Article 32 primarily relates to fundamental rights,  the text highlights that its power extends beyond this. For instance, the Supreme Court can grant special leave to appeal in any matter, covering a wide range of legal issues.  The broader scope of the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction and its power to grant special leave significantly expands its reach beyond fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Parliament can enlarge the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and powers concerning matters listed in the Union List. This reflects the constitutional balance between legislative and judicial powers, allowing the legislature to adjust the Supreme Court's scope based on evolving needs.  The Parliament's power to adjust the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in this manner demonstrates the flexibility built into the Indian Constitution to adapt to changing circumstances.


**10. With reference to the High Court's power to punish for contempt of court, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution defines the expression "contempt of court."
2. The High Court can punish for contempt of courts and tribunals throughout the country.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the Constitution does *not* define "contempt of court," but rather this is defined by the Contempt of Court Act of 1971. This distinction highlights the interplay between constitutional provisions and statutory laws in defining legal concepts.  The reliance on a separate Act to define contempt reflects the need for a detailed and nuanced legal framework to address this complex area of law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The High Court's power to punish for contempt is limited to its own territorial jurisdiction. While the Supreme Court can punish for contempt of courts and tribunals across India, this power is not vested in High Courts. The difference in the scope of contempt powers between the Supreme Court and High Courts reflects the hierarchical structure of the Indian judicial system and the unique position of the Supreme Court as the highest court of appeal.


**1. With reference to the Union Territories of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India appoints the Administrator for Union Territories, who is responsible for the administration of the Union Territory.
2.  The Parliament has the power to make laws for Union Territories on all subjects in the State List.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Administrator for Union Territories. While the exact structure of administration can vary, the Administrator is ultimately responsible for the governance of the UT.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution grants Parliament the power to legislate on all subjects, including those in the State List, for Union Territories. This is a significant difference from states, where the State Legislature has primary jurisdiction over the State List.  This reflects the central government's greater control over Union Territories.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The original Constitution of India included seven Fundamental Rights.
2.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights and made it a legal right.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The original Constitution drafted in 1949 contained seven Fundamental Rights.  These rights were considered crucial for safeguarding individual liberties and ensuring equality.

Statement 2 is correct. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 significantly altered the status of the Right to Property.  While it was initially a Fundamental Right, this amendment removed it from Part III (Fundamental Rights) and placed it as a legal right under Article 300A in Part XII. This change reflected a shift in the government's approach to property rights.


**3. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The CAG has the power to audit the accounts of all government departments, including those of the State Governments, but not the accounts of the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President and enjoys a high degree of independence, holding office until the pleasure of the President. This ensures that the CAG can function without undue political influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG's audit extends to the accounts of all government departments, including those of the State Governments, and also encompasses the accounts of certain Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). The scope of the CAG's audit is quite comprehensive, ensuring financial accountability across various sectors.


**4. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament, for violation of the Constitution.
2.  The President's salary and allowances cannot be diminished during his/her term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution outlines a specific process for the removal of the President, which involves impeachment by a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament for violating the Constitution.  This safeguard prevents arbitrary removal and ensures that the process is deliberate and serious.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President's emoluments and allowances are constitutionally protected against reduction during his or her term. This provision is designed to ensure the President's financial security and independence from political pressures.


**5. Consider the following statements pertaining to the Indian Judiciary:**

1.  The Supreme Court of India has the power to review its own judgments or orders.
2.  The Supreme Court’s judgements are binding only on the lower courts and not on itself.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court possesses the inherent power to review its own judgments or orders. This power is crucial for ensuring that justice is served and allows the court to correct any errors or inconsistencies in its previous decisions.  This self-correcting mechanism is a hallmark of a robust judicial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's judgments are binding on all courts within India's territory, including lower courts. However, the Supreme Court itself is not strictly bound by its previous decisions; it can revisit and overturn them if necessary.  This flexibility allows the court to adapt to evolving societal norms and legal interpretations.


**6. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to nominate members to the Legislative Council.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This reflects the hierarchical relationship between the Centre and the States within the Indian federal structure.  The President's power to remove the Governor ensures the Centre's ultimate authority.

Statement 2 is correct.  In states with a bicameral legislature (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), the Governor has the power to nominate a certain number of members to the Legislative Council. This power provides representation for experts and specialists.


**7. With reference to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  It mandated the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2.  It provided for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats, proportionate to their population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 is a landmark legislation that provided constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj system in India.  It mandated the establishment of a three-tier system (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad) across all states, aiming to empower local self-governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendment also incorporated provisions for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs and STs) in Panchayats. This reservation is intended to ensure that marginalized communities are adequately represented in local governance, promoting social justice.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a Money Bill.
2.  A joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament can be convened to resolve disagreements on an ordinary bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution explicitly grants the Lok Sabha (House of the People) the exclusive power to initiate a Money Bill. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to a Money Bill but cannot initiate or amend its core provisions.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution provides for a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament to resolve deadlocks on ordinary bills.  If the two Houses fail to reach an agreement, the President can convene a joint sitting where the Lok Sabha's view prevails due to its larger membership. This mechanism ensures the passage of legislation even in the face of inter-house disagreements.


**9.  With reference to the Basic Structure Doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Basic Structure Doctrine was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
2.  The doctrine holds that even a Constitutional Amendment cannot alter the basic features of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The landmark Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case (1973) is where the Supreme Court of India first articulated the Basic Structure Doctrine. This doctrine significantly limited Parliament's amending power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Basic Structure Doctrine establishes that certain fundamental features of the Constitution are inviolable, even through the process of constitutional amendment.  These features, which are not explicitly defined but are implied, form the core of India's democratic framework.  Any amendment that attempts to alter these basic features can be challenged and struck down by the judiciary.


**10. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination.
2.  The members of the UPSC are appointed by the Prime Minister of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is the primary body responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination, a highly competitive exam that selects candidates for various prestigious positions in the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and other central services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister. This ensures a greater degree of independence and impartiality in the selection process.  The President's involvement underscores the importance of the UPSC's role in the nation's governance.


**11. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.
2.  They aim to establish a socialistic pattern of society in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, are not legally enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the government to strive towards social and economic justice.  The non-justiciable nature ensures that they remain aspirational goals that adapt to changing circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles aim to create a more just and equitable society, incorporating elements of socialism.  While not directly enforcing a socialist economic system, they promote social welfare measures, reducing income disparities, and ensuring access to essential resources.


**12. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2.  The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment Act, 1951.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While initially laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has since clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The court has the power to review laws in the Ninth Schedule if they violate fundamental rights or other basic features of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was introduced into the Constitution through the First Amendment Act of 1951.  It was intended to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, but its scope has been significantly redefined over time.


**13. Consider the following statements about the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC):**

1.  The NJAC Act, 2014 was struck down by the Supreme Court of India.
2.  The NJAC was intended to replace the collegium system for appointing judges to the higher judiciary.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NJAC Act, 2014, which aimed to establish a commission for appointing judges to the higher judiciary, was declared unconstitutional and void by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the NJAC infringed upon the judiciary's independence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NJAC was intended to replace the existing collegium system, which involves the appointment of judges by a group of senior judges. The government sought to introduce the NJAC to bring greater transparency and accountability to the judicial appointments process.


**14. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is the nominal head of the State government, while the Chief Minister is the real executive head.
2.  The Rajya Sabha represents the States in the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the Indian federal structure, the Governor is the constitutional head of the State, but the real executive power lies with the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers, who are accountable to the State Legislative Assembly.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, represents the States in the Parliament.  Each state is allocated a number of seats in the Rajya Sabha based on its population.  This ensures that the interests of the states are considered in the legislative process.


**15. With reference to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, consider the following statements:**

1. It deals with the conduct of elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.
2. It provides for the disqualification of candidates based on certain grounds.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, is a crucial piece of legislation that lays down the framework for conducting elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and State Legislative Assemblies.  It details the electoral process, including voter registration, nomination of candidates, polling procedures, and the declaration of results.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act also contains provisions for disqualifying candidates from contesting elections on various grounds, such as holding an office of profit under the government, criminal convictions, and corrupt practices.  These disqualification provisions aim to maintain the integrity and fairness of the electoral process.


**16. Consider the following statements about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body.
2.  The NHRC has the power to initiate investigations into human rights violations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and not a constitutional body.  While its functions are crucial for human rights protection, it lacks the constitutional backing enjoyed by some other institutions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC is empowered to investigate human rights violations, either suo moto (on its own initiative) or on complaints received.  It can recommend remedial measures to the government, but its recommendations are not legally binding.  Its influence, however, is significant in shaping human rights policy and practice.


**17. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.
2.  The Attorney General has the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment typically involves consultation with the Prime Minister, reflecting the government's role in selecting the chief legal advisor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Attorney General has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, without a right to vote.  This privilege allows the Attorney General to provide legal advice and guidance to Parliament on important matters.


**18.  Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

1.  The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India every five years.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Finance Commission every five years or as needed.  This ensures a regular review of the country's financial arrangements and distribution of resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments. While their recommendations are highly influential and usually followed, the government retains the discretion to accept or reject them, with Parliament's approval as needed.  This provision reflects the government's ultimate responsibility for budgetary decisions.


**19. With reference to the State Public Service Commission (SPSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SPSC is responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for State Government services.
2.  The Chairman and members of the SPSC are appointed by the Governor of the State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The SPSC plays a critical role in recruiting candidates for various positions in the State Government services.  It conducts competitive examinations and interviews to ensure fair and merit-based selection.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of the State appoints the Chairman and members of the SPSC.  This ensures that the appointments are made in accordance with constitutional norms and procedures.  The Governor's role highlights the state government's oversight of the SPSC's functions.


**20. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1.  Gram Sabhas are the decision-making bodies at the village level.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates the reservation of seats for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gram Sabhas, as mandated by the 73rd Amendment, are the village-level assemblies where all adult residents participate in decision-making.  They play a vital role in local governance and development.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act introduced a significant provision for the reservation of seats for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).  This reservation aims to enhance women's participation in local governance and empower them in decision-making processes.  This is a crucial step toward gender equality and social inclusion.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission of India is a body with a fixed number of members, as specified in the Constitution.
2.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs plays a crucial role in determining the election schedule for both general and by-elections, ensuring a smooth and timely process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a body with a fixed number of members specified in the Constitution.  While it currently functions with a single Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, the number can be altered by the government as per the needs and exigencies of the situation. The Constitution only mandates the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner, while the number of other Election Commissioners can be determined by the government.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does *not* decide the election schedule. The Election Commission of India is an independent body constitutionally empowered to conduct free and fair elections and  it alone determines the election schedule. The ECI's independence is crucial to its ability to function impartially, free from executive influence. The Home Ministry's role is limited to providing logistical support and security for the elections as directed by the ECI.



**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2.  The removal of the Council of Ministers in a State is a necessary consequence of the imposition of President's rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 often results in the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in session, depending on the circumstances and the assessment of the situation. The decision to dissolve the assembly rests with the President and is not a mandatory outcome of imposing President's rule.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The removal of the Council of Ministers is a common practice following the imposition of President's rule, as the existing government is deemed to have lost its mandate. However, it's not a strict constitutional requirement.  The President can, theoretically, retain the existing Council of Ministers for a short period to facilitate the transition.  The primary focus of President's rule is to restore constitutional order, and the removal of ministers is a means to that end, not an inherent condition.



**3. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a clear and equal distribution of powers between the Centre and the States, ensuring a balance of power.
2.  The Rajya Sabha's composition reflects a principle of equal representation for all federating units, promoting fairness and equity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian federal system is not based on a clear and *equal* distribution of powers.  While powers are divided between the Centre and the States, the Centre holds significantly more power in several areas.  This asymmetry reflects the historical context of India's independence and the need for national unity. The distribution of powers leans towards a quasi-federal system, with the Centre having greater authority in critical domains.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does *not* reflect a principle of equal representation for all federating units. States are represented disproportionately in the Rajya Sabha based on their population. Larger states have a greater number of representatives than smaller states, leading to an imbalance in representation within the upper house of Parliament.  This unequal representation is a key feature distinguishing the Indian federation from a purely symmetrical federal structure.


**4. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Local self-government primarily functions as a mechanism for administrative delegation, streamlining the flow of power from higher authorities.
2.  The concept of local self-government is fundamentally an exercise in direct democracy, enabling citizens to directly participate in decision-making processes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While local self-government involves some degree of administrative delegation, its primary function is not simply to streamline power from higher levels.  It's more accurately described as a form of democratic decentralization, empowering local communities to manage their own affairs and participate in governance.  Administrative delegation is a secondary aspect, not the core purpose.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Local self-government is not an exercise in *direct* democracy.  It operates through elected representatives (Panchayati Raj Institutions or Municipalities) who make decisions on behalf of their constituents. While citizen participation is encouraged, it is not a system of direct decision-making by all citizens on every issue.  Direct democracy would imply referendums or similar mechanisms for every policy choice, which is impractical at the local level.



**5. With reference to the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The adjournment motion is a primary tool for the Parliament to exercise effective control over the Council of Ministers' actions.
2.  Supplementary questions during Question Hour provide a significant mechanism for the Parliament to scrutinize the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The adjournment motion, although rarely successful, is a powerful tool available to the Parliament to express its disapproval of government policies or actions.  By forcing a debate on an urgent matter of public importance, it puts pressure on the government to respond and potentially change course. While the motion itself may be defeated, the debate itself serves as a check on the government's power.


Statement 2 is correct. Supplementary questions during Question Hour allow for a deeper investigation into the government's activities and policies.  These follow-up questions can expose inconsistencies, gaps in information, or inadequacies in government actions.  The ability to ask detailed supplementary questions enhances the Parliament's ability to hold the Council of Ministers accountable.



**6. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill is exclusively introduced by a nominated Member of Parliament (MP), not an elected one.
2.  A private member's bill has been successfully passed in the Indian Parliament multiple times throughout its history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Private member's bills can be introduced by *both* elected and nominated MPs.  The distinction lies in the fact that they are introduced by members who are not ministers or members of the government, unlike government bills.  The source of their introduction (elected or nominated) does not define the bill's classification as a private member's bill.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While private member's bills are introduced regularly, their passage into law is exceptionally rare.  Government bills typically dominate the legislative agenda, and private member's bills often face significant challenges in securing parliamentary approval.  The passage of a private member's bill is a rare event, not a common occurrence.



**7. With reference to the parliamentary form of government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The executive and legislature function entirely independently, ensuring a clear separation of powers.
2.  A key advantage of the parliamentary system is the executive's accountability to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A defining characteristic of the parliamentary system is the fusion of the executive and legislature.  The executive (Council of Ministers) is drawn from the legislature (Parliament), and it is accountable to it.  There is no strict separation of powers; instead, there is a system of checks and balances between these two branches of government.


Statement 2 is correct.  A major advantage of the parliamentary system is that the executive (government) is accountable to the legislature. This accountability is ensured through mechanisms such as Question Hour, debates, no-confidence motions, and other parliamentary procedures.  This accountability ensures that the government remains responsive to the legislature and, ultimately, the people.



**8. With reference to the Cabinet form of government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cabinet system primarily aims to minimize criticism of the government by streamlining decision-making processes.
2.  The Cabinet system serves as a mechanism of parliamentary democracy to ensure collective responsibility of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cabinet system seeks efficiency and coordinated action, its primary goal is not to minimize criticism.  The government is still subject to scrutiny and criticism from the legislature and the public.  The Cabinet system aims for effective governance and decision-making, not the suppression of criticism.


Statement 2 is correct. The Cabinet form of government is integral to parliamentary democracy.  The principle of collective responsibility holds the entire Cabinet accountable for its actions and policies.  This ensures that the government acts as a unified entity, taking collective responsibility for its decisions, and prevents individual ministers from acting independently.



**9. With reference to judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Judicial review empowers the judiciary to assess the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2.  Judicial review enables the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India is not concerned with the *wisdom* of laws.  The judiciary does not assess whether a law is good policy or a wise decision; it only determines whether the law is constitutionally valid. The legislature is the body responsible for determining the wisdom of policy choices.


Statement 2 is correct.  Judicial review is a cornerstone of the Indian judicial system. It empowers the courts to determine whether laws passed by the legislature or actions taken by the executive are consistent with the Constitution.  If a law or action is found to be unconstitutional, the court can strike it down. This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.



**10. With reference to the features of democracy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Democracy’s strength lies in its ability to enhance the intelligence and character of ordinary citizens.
2.  Democracy thrives on the existence of a strong and charismatic leader with a clear vision for the future.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key advantage of democracy is its ability to foster civic engagement and empower citizens to participate in decision-making.  This participation enhances both their intellectual capacity and their sense of civic responsibility.  The ongoing dialogue and deliberation inherent in democratic processes contribute to a more informed and engaged citizenry.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While strong leadership can play a role in a democracy, it is not essential for its success.  Democracy emphasizes the importance of collective decision-making, citizen participation, and the rule of law.  Over-reliance on a single leader can undermine democratic principles and lead to authoritarian tendencies.  The focus is on systems and processes, not on individuals.


**11. With reference to equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1.  Equality implies the absence of privileges for certain groups or individuals.
2.  Equality necessarily leads to the absence of competition within society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Equality before the law and equal opportunities are core tenets of a just society.  This requires the elimination of special privileges granted to certain groups or individuals based on factors such as birth, caste, religion, or gender.  Equality aims to create a level playing field where everyone has a fair chance to succeed.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Equality does *not* eliminate competition.  Competition can exist within a framework of equality, provided that it is fair and based on merit.  Equality ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to compete, but it does not guarantee equal outcomes.  Competition can be a positive force for innovation and progress, even in an egalitarian society.


**12. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  Residuary powers under the 1935 Act were vested in the Federal Legislature.
2.  The 1935 Act's federal structure was based on a clear division of powers, with no overlap between the federal and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under the Government of India Act 1935, residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to either the federal or provincial governments) were vested in the *Governor-General*, not the Federal Legislature. This reflected the Act's intention to grant significant power to the central government.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1935 Act's federal structure involved a complex system with significant overlap of powers and responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments. This led to numerous ambiguities and conflicts in practice, highlighting the inherent challenges in crafting a truly balanced federal arrangement. Concurrent lists further contributed to this complexity.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1.  An Aadhaar card can be used as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2.  Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or modified by the issuing authority under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While an Aadhaar card can be used as proof of identity and residence, it is *not* considered definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes, and an Aadhaar card does not replace those processes.  The card serves as a unique identification tool but doesn't establish legal status.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated or modified under certain circumstances, such as errors in the data or requests from individuals.  The issuing authority (UIDAI) has established procedures for updating and correcting information associated with Aadhaar numbers.  The system is not immutable; it allows for corrections and updates to ensure accuracy.



**14. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned and guaranteed as a fundamental right in a separate article of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has interpreted the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in a separate article of the Indian Constitution.  It was not initially considered a fundamental right.


Statement 2 is correct.  In the landmark *Puttaswamy* judgment (2017), the Supreme Court of India recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, intrinsically linked to Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).  The Court held that privacy is essential for individual autonomy and dignity, making it an integral part of Article 21. This interpretation significantly expanded the scope of fundamental rights in India.



**15. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The electoral value of each Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) is uniform across all states.
2.  The electoral value of votes cast by Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Lok Sabha is higher than that of Rajya Sabha MPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electoral value of each MLA's vote varies from state to state, based on the population of each state. This system is designed to ensure that states with larger populations have a greater influence on the presidential election. The formula for calculating the electoral value involves dividing the state's population by the number of MLAs, leading to variations across states.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The electoral value of an MP's vote is the same in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The formula used to determine the electoral value of each MP's vote is identical for both houses of Parliament.  There is no differential weighting based on the chamber to which the MP belongs.


**16. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor of a State in any court during his/her term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor cannot be decreased during their term of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution grants immunity to Governors from criminal prosecution during their term of office.  This protection is aimed at ensuring the impartiality and independence of the Governor's office, allowing them to perform their duties without fear of political reprisal or interference.  Legal proceedings against a Governor can only be initiated after their term ends.


Statement 2 is correct.  The emoluments and allowances of a Governor are fixed and cannot be reduced during their tenure.  This provision ensures the financial security of the Governor, further enhancing their independence and preventing political manipulation through financial pressure.  Changes to their compensation can only be made after their term concludes.



**17. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Committee on Government Assurances scrutinizes and reports on whether the government is fulfilling its promises made to Parliament.
2.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines the extent to which the executive is exercising its delegated law-making powers appropriately.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances is a parliamentary committee responsible for monitoring the government's progress on assurances given to Parliament.  It examines whether the government is fulfilling its pledges and commitments, holding it accountable for its promises.  The committee's reports highlight any lapses or delays in the implementation of assurances.


Statement 2 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation is a parliamentary committee that reviews the quality of rules, regulations, and by-laws made by the executive branch under delegated legislative powers. It ensures that the executive does not exceed its authority and that the subordinate legislation is in accordance with the parent legislation. This scrutiny helps maintain the balance of power between the legislature and the executive.


**18. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Speaker of a Legislative Assembly automatically vacates their office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.
2.  If a Speaker of a Legislative Assembly ceases to be a member of the Assembly, they must immediately vacate their office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Speaker of a Legislative Assembly does *not* automatically vacate their office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.  While the Assembly is dissolved, the Speaker's position remains until a new Assembly is constituted and a new Speaker is elected.  There is a continuity of office until the next election.


Statement 2 is correct.  A crucial condition for holding the office of Speaker is membership in the Legislative Assembly.  If the Speaker ceases to be a member (e.g., through resignation, defeat in an election, or disqualification), they must immediately vacate the Speaker's office.  This requirement ensures that the Speaker remains a legitimate representative of the Assembly.


**19. With reference to the imposition of President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The imposition of President's rule automatically leads to the suspension of Article 19 (freedoms of speech, expression, etc.) in the affected State.
2.  The President's rule empowers the Parliament to enact laws for the affected State, overriding the State Legislature's powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's rule does *not* automatically suspend Article 19 in the affected State.  While fundamental rights can be restricted during emergencies, the suspension of Article 19 is not an automatic consequence of President's rule.  Such a suspension would require a separate order and would be subject to judicial review.


Statement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of President's rule is that the Parliament gains the power to make laws for the affected State.  This temporarily overrides the State Legislature's law-making authority, enabling the Parliament to address the situation that necessitated President's rule.  This power is a crucial element in restoring constitutional order.


**20. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament of India can add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are completely immune from judicial review, regardless of when they were added.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  This power was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, but it has been used for a wider range of legislation.  The addition of a law to the Ninth Schedule is a legislative act subject to the usual parliamentary procedures.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has held that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Court's power of judicial review remains a check on legislative action, even for laws in the Ninth Schedule.


**21. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Swatantra Party was the single largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.
2. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was formally recognized for the first time in 1969.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the first Lok Sabha, the Swatantra Party emerged as the largest single opposition party.  This reflected the diverse political landscape of newly independent India, with various parties vying for influence. The party represented a significant voice of opposition during that period.


Statement 2 is correct. The formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha began in 1969.  Before this, the role existed informally, but the establishment of formal criteria and procedures for its recognition marked a significant development in parliamentary practice. This formalization helped to solidify the role of the opposition in the Indian parliamentary system.



**22. With reference to the relationship between law and liberty, consider the following statements:**

1. The existence of numerous laws invariably diminishes individual liberty.
2. The absence of laws is incompatible with the existence of liberty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between law and liberty is not simply inverse. A substantial number of laws are necessary to define and protect individual rights and freedoms.  The absence of laws can lead to chaos and the erosion of liberty, as individual rights become vulnerable to the arbitrary actions of others.  Laws are essential to establish a framework for liberty.


Statement 2 is correct.  Liberty cannot exist in a state of lawlessness.  Laws provide a framework for order and security, which are essential prerequisites for the enjoyment of liberty.  Without laws to define and protect individual rights, liberty becomes vulnerable to arbitrary power.  A well-defined legal system is fundamental to the protection of liberty.



**23. With reference to the "Rule of Law," consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rule of Law necessitates the limitation of governmental powers.
2.  The Rule of Law implies that the government is responsible to the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core principle of the Rule of Law is the limitation of governmental power.  This involves establishing clear legal limits on the actions of the state, preventing arbitrary exercise of power and protecting individual rights.  This limitation is achieved through constitutional provisions, judicial review, and other mechanisms.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Rule of Law requires that the government is accountable to the people.  This accountability is achieved through various mechanisms, including elections, free press, an independent judiciary, and other checks and balances.  Governmental power must be exercised in a way that respects the rights and interests of the governed.



**24. With reference to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTE Act mandates that teacher eligibility in a State be determined solely by the minimum qualifications set by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE).
2.  The RTE Act requires candidates teaching primary classes to pass a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) conducted according to NCTE guidelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTE Act does *not* mandate that teacher eligibility be determined *solely* by NCTE guidelines.  While NCTE plays a significant role in setting standards for teacher education, State Councils for Teacher Education also have a role in determining minimum qualifications. The Act allows for a degree of flexibility and state-level input.


Statement 2 is correct.  A key provision of the RTE Act is the requirement for candidates teaching primary classes to pass a TET conducted as per NCTE guidelines.  This ensures a minimum level of competency among primary school teachers, contributing to the quality of education.  The TET is a crucial component of the Act's implementation strategy.


**25. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament, whereas the CPCB was created through an executive order.
2.  The NGT's primary function is to provide environmental justice and reduce the burden on higher courts, while the CPCB focuses primarily on monitoring pollution levels and enforcing environmental regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established through an Act of Parliament, giving it statutory authority and ensuring its independence.  In contrast, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was established through an executive order, making it subject to greater government influence.  The difference in their establishment reflects the different roles they play.


Statement 2 is correct.  The NGT's main function is to provide a specialized and expeditious mechanism for addressing environmental disputes, thereby reducing the burden on higher courts.  The CPCB, on the other hand, focuses on monitoring pollution levels, enforcing environmental regulations, and advising the government on environmental matters.  Their distinct functions reflect their different mandates.


**26. With reference to Money Bills, consider the following statement:**

A bill is considered a Money Bill if it contains provisions relating to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.

Which of the following options correctly characterizes the statement?
(a) The statement is completely accurate and comprehensive in defining a Money Bill.
(b) The statement is partially accurate but omits other essential aspects of a Money Bill.
(c) The statement is largely inaccurate and misrepresents the definition of a Money Bill.
(d) The statement is irrelevant to the concept of Money Bills.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement is partially correct.  It correctly identifies one crucial aspect of a Money Bill—provisions related to taxation. However, it is not a comprehensive definition.  A Money Bill encompasses more than just taxation. It also includes provisions related to the borrowing of money by the government, the custody of money, the payment of money into the Consolidated Fund of India, and the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India.  The statement only addresses one element of the broader definition.  A complete definition would include these other critical components.  Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but incomplete.  The other options are incorrect because they overstate or understate the significance of the statement.  The statement is relevant to Money Bills but not fully accurate, making (b) the most appropriate response.


**1. With reference to the appointment of Supreme Court Judges, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India appoints Supreme Court judges solely based on the advice of the Chief Justice of India.
2.  The Constitution mandates a minimum age for appointment as a Supreme Court judge.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints Supreme Court judges, it's not solely based on the Chief Justice of India's advice.  The process involves consultations with the Chief Justice and other senior judges, forming a collegium.  The President's role is largely formal, though the government can exert influence. The system is complex and has evolved through judicial pronouncements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* prescribe a minimum age for appointment as a Supreme Court judge.  While experience and qualifications are specified (e.g., practicing advocate for 10 years, High Court judge for 5 years, or distinguished jurist), age is not a constitutional requirement.  This contrasts with certain other government positions that have mandatory minimum age limits.  The focus is on legal expertise and standing rather than a specific chronological age.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's jurisdiction:**

1. The Supreme Court possesses exclusive original jurisdiction in all inter-state water disputes.
2.  The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to all judgments of High Courts, regardless of subject matter.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court does *not* have exclusive original jurisdiction in all inter-state water disputes.  The Inter-State Water Disputes Act of 1956 specifically excludes the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in such matters, establishing a separate mechanism for resolving these disputes.  This is a significant exception to the Supreme Court's broad original jurisdiction, reflecting the specialized nature of water resource management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is wide but not unlimited. While it can hear appeals from High Courts in various matters (constitutional, civil, criminal), it's not automatic.  Certain appeals require a certificate from the High Court, and the Supreme Court retains the power to grant "special leave" to appeal, meaning it can choose which cases it will hear.  It doesn't have to accept every appeal from a High Court.  The selectivity is crucial for managing the Court's workload and focusing on cases of significant legal importance.


**3. With reference to the independence of the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can curtail the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court.
2. The salaries and allowances of Supreme Court judges are determined by the Parliament but cannot be altered to their disadvantage after appointment, except during a financial emergency.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution explicitly prohibits Parliament from curtailing the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and powers.  This is a fundamental aspect of judicial independence, ensuring the Court can fulfill its role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution without fear of legislative interference. While Parliament can extend the Court's jurisdiction, it cannot diminish it. This protection is vital for the rule of law and prevents the legislature from undermining judicial checks and balances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Parliament determines the salaries, allowances, and pensions of Supreme Court judges. However, a crucial safeguard is that these cannot be reduced after a judge's appointment, except during a declared financial emergency. This provision protects judicial independence by preventing the legislature from using financial pressure to influence judicial decisions. The exception during a financial emergency reflects a recognition of extraordinary circumstances, but even then, the changes would need to be carefully considered given their implication for judicial integrity.


**4. With reference to the removal of Supreme Court judges, consider the following statements:**

1. A judge of the Supreme Court can be removed from office by the President based on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India alone.
2.  The grounds for removal of a Supreme Court judge are proved misbehavior or incapacity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The removal of a Supreme Court judge is a complex process involving Parliament, not just the Chief Justice of India.  A special majority in both Houses of Parliament is required to address the President, who then issues the removal order.  The Chief Justice's opinion might be sought during an inquiry, but the final decision rests with Parliament. This elaborate procedure safeguards against arbitrary removal and protects judicial independence from executive or single-person influence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution clearly specifies that a Supreme Court judge can only be removed from office on the grounds of "proved misbehavior or incapacity."  This high threshold prevents politically motivated removals and protects the integrity of the judiciary.  The "proved" aspect requires a rigorous process of investigation and evidence gathering, ensuring that accusations are thoroughly vetted before any action is taken.  The limited grounds for removal reinforce the principle of judicial independence.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the High Courts:**

1.  The President appoints High Court judges in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the concerned state.
2.  The Constitution specifies the exact number of judges for each High Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints High Court judges, but the process involves consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the state. This consultative process aims to ensure that appointments are based on merit and avoid political interference. However, the Chief Justice of India's role in the collegium system gives the judiciary significant influence over this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* specify the exact number of judges for each High Court.  The number of judges is determined by the President based on the workload and needs of each High Court. This flexibility allows for adjustments based on the changing demands of the judicial system in different states.  The President's decision reflects the executive's role in administering the judiciary, but it is usually influenced by the judiciary's own assessments of its needs.


**6. With reference to the High Courts' jurisdiction, consider the following statements:**

1.  High Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in all matters relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights.
2.  The Parliament can confer additional powers on High Courts beyond those specified in the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  High Courts do *not* have exclusive original jurisdiction in matters relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court also has this power (Article 32), and citizens can choose to approach either court.  The concurrent jurisdiction ensures access to justice and provides multiple avenues for redressal of fundamental rights violations.  While High Courts are important protectors of fundamental rights within their jurisdictions, the Supreme Court acts as the final arbiter.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution doesn't exhaustively list all the powers of High Courts.  The Parliament has the power to confer additional powers on High Courts, which allows for the adaptation of the judicial system to evolving needs and circumstances.  This power needs to be exercised judiciously to avoid undermining the judiciary's independence but it provides flexibility for necessary reforms and improvements in judicial processes.


**7. Consider the following statements about Administrative Tribunals:**

1. The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has jurisdiction over all service matters of all public servants in India.
2. Appeals against the orders of the CAT lie exclusively with the Supreme Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAT's jurisdiction is not all-encompassing. It does not cover members of the defence forces, officers and servants of the Supreme Court, or the secretarial staff of Parliament.  The scope of the CAT's jurisdiction is specifically defined by legislation, and certain categories of public servants are excluded.  This reflects the need to maintain separate mechanisms for dealing with sensitive or specialized areas of employment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against CAT orders do *not* lie exclusively with the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court ruled in the Chandra Kumar case (1997) that appeals can also be made to the High Courts.  This ruling recognized the importance of judicial review at both the High Court and Supreme Court levels, ensuring multiple layers of scrutiny of Administrative Tribunal decisions.  This enhances the fairness and accountability of the administrative justice system.


**1. With reference to the National Social Assistance Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Programme primarily fulfills the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution.
2. The Programme significantly contributes to the fulfillment of Directive Principles of State Policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a flagship social security scheme of the Government of India.  While the programme indirectly supports the overall well-being of citizens, aligning with the spirit of Fundamental Rights, its core function lies in fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy.  The NSAP aims to provide social security and a minimum standard of living to vulnerable groups, which directly addresses the Directive Principles focused on social justice, economic equality, and the welfare state.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because the NSAP doesn't directly enforce specific Fundamental Rights; it operates within the framework of the Constitution to improve the lives of citizens, but this isn't its primary constitutional basis.  The programme's impact on Fundamental Rights is indirect and consequential rather than a direct fulfillment.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's advisory role, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can advise the President on matters of law or fact solely at the President's request.
2. The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction extends only to matters concerning the Fundamental Rights of citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India has an advisory jurisdiction, meaning it can provide advice to the President on matters of law or fact.  However, this advice is not binding on the President.  Statement 1 correctly reflects that the Supreme Court provides advice only when specifically requested by the President.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not limited to Fundamental Rights issues.  The Court can offer advice on any matter the President deems necessary, encompassing a broader range of legal and policy concerns.  The President's discretion in seeking advice is crucial here, and the scope is not restricted to just Fundamental Rights.


**3. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats exclusively handle pre-litigative matters and cannot address cases already pending in courts.
2. Lok Adalats primarily deal with civil disputes, excluding criminal cases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lok Adalats are informal dispute resolution mechanisms designed to provide quick and inexpensive justice.  While they are often used for pre-litigative settlements, Lok Adalats also have the power to resolve cases already pending in courts if the parties involved agree to refer the matter to them. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is largely correct as Lok Adalats predominantly deal with civil matters.  However, some Lok Adalats have been empowered to handle certain types of compoundable criminal offenses, making the statement not entirely accurate.  The primary focus, however, remains on civil disputes.


**4. With reference to the "Instrument of Instructions" in the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Instrument of Instructions was directly incorporated as Fundamental Rights in the 1950 Constitution.
2. The principles of the Instrument of Instructions were incorporated into the Directive Principles of State Policy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 contained "Instrument of Instructions" which provided guidelines to the Governor-General and Governors.  These instructions were largely aspirational and not legally enforceable.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Instrument of Instructions was not directly translated into Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution.  Statement 2 is correct;  several principles from the Instrument of Instructions, concerning social and economic welfare, found their way into the Directive Principles of State Policy in the 1950 Constitution.  The Directive Principles reflect the broader ethos of the Instrument of Instructions, but without the same binding nature.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is responsible for laying the Finance Commission's recommendations before Parliament.
2. The Union Finance Minister presents the Finance Commission's recommendations to Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States.  Statement 1 is correct; the Constitution mandates that the President, as the head of state, lays the Finance Commission's recommendations before both houses of Parliament.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the Union Finance Minister does not directly present the recommendations; the President fulfills this constitutional responsibility.  The Finance Minister, however, plays a crucial role in the government's response to these recommendations.


**6. With reference to the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2. The Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for preparing the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial financial document outlining the government's revenue and expenditure plans.  While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in tax collection and revenue projections, the primary responsibility for preparing the Union Budget rests with the Department of Economic Affairs.  This department coordinates the budget-making process across various ministries and departments. Therefore, statement 2 is correct, while statement 1 is incorrect.  The Department of Revenue's involvement is substantial, but it is the Department of Economic Affairs that takes the lead in the preparation.


**7. With reference to the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy applies only to individuals displaced due to land acquisition for projects, excluding other forms of involuntary displacement.
2. The Ministry of Rural Development formulated the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, aims to provide support and compensation to individuals displaced due to various development projects.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the policy's scope is not limited to land acquisition for projects.  It encompasses a broader range of involuntary displacement situations.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Ministry of Rural Development did not formulate this policy.  It was formulated by the Ministry of Rural Development.  The policy's comprehensive approach addresses various displacement scenarios, going beyond just land acquisition for specific projects.


**8. With reference to the Consumer Disputes Redressal at the district level in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A State Government can establish multiple District Forums within a single district.
2. At least one member of a District Forum must be a woman.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Consumer Protection Act establishes a three-tier system of consumer dispute redressal, including District Forums at the district level.  Statement 1 is correct; the Act allows state governments to establish more than one District Forum in a district if deemed necessary to handle the caseload effectively.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Act mandates that at least one member of each District Forum must be a woman to ensure gender representation and balanced perspectives in consumer dispute resolution.


**9. With reference to the authority recommending principles for Panchayat taxation, consider the following statements:**

1. State Finance Commissions recommend principles for determining taxes and duties appropriable by Panchayats.
2. District Planning Committees recommend principles for determining taxes and duties appropriable by Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution mandates the establishment of State Finance Commissions to review the financial position of Panchayats and Municipalities.  Statement 1 is correct; State Finance Commissions are responsible for making recommendations to the Governor on the principles governing the taxation powers of Panchayats within the state.  Statement 2 is incorrect because District Planning Committees are primarily involved in planning and development at the district level, not directly in recommending taxation principles for Panchayats.  Their role is distinct from the financial recommendations made by the State Finance Commissions.


**10. With reference to taxes on stock exchange transactions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Government levies taxes on stock exchange and futures market transactions.
2. State Governments collect taxes levied by the Union on stock exchange and futures market transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Taxes on transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets are a significant source of revenue.  Statement 1 is correct; the Union Government levies these taxes under its power to tax income and capital gains.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while state governments may collect some indirect taxes related to these transactions, the primary tax levied and collected on stock exchange transactions is under the Union’s purview. The Union government's power to levy such taxes stems from its constitutional authority over matters related to finance and trade.


**11. With reference to the Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act, 1992, consider the following:**

1. The Act mandates the constitution of District Planning Committees.
2. The Act establishes State Election Commissions to conduct Panchayat elections.
3. The Act provides for the establishment of State Finance Commissions.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, is a landmark legislation that constitutionalized the Panchayati Raj system in India.  All three statements are correct.  The Act mandates the formation of District Planning Committees to involve local bodies in planning processes.  It also establishes State Election Commissions to conduct free and fair elections to Panchayats and ensures their independence.  Finally, it provides for the establishment of State Finance Commissions to review the financial position of Panchayats and recommend principles for taxation and resource allocation.


**12. With reference to the status of a national minority in India, consider the following:**

1. A recognized national minority can establish and administer exclusive educational institutions.
2. The President automatically nominates a representative of a national minority to the Lok Sabha.
3. National minorities benefit from the Prime Minister's 15-Point Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India provides safeguards for linguistic and religious minorities.  Statement 1 is correct; national minorities have the right to establish and administer their own educational institutions, subject to certain regulations.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the President does not automatically nominate a representative of a national minority to the Lok Sabha.  Nominations to the Rajya Sabha are made by the President, but Lok Sabha representation is based on direct elections.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while various government programmes might benefit national minorities, there is no specific Prime Minister's 15-Point Programme exclusively designed for them.


**13. With reference to benefits available to persons with disabilities in India, consider the following:**

1. Free schooling up to age 18 is guaranteed in government-run schools for all persons with disabilities.
2. Preferential land allotment for business is a legal benefit for persons with disabilities.
3. Ramps in public buildings are mandated to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides various rights and benefits to persons with disabilities.  Statement 1 is largely correct; free and compulsory education is provided up to the age of 18, but not all government schools may have the necessary infrastructure or support.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while some states may have preferential policies, it is not a universally guaranteed legal benefit.  Statement 3 is correct; the Act mandates accessibility features in public buildings, including ramps, to ensure inclusivity.


**14. With reference to the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following:**

1. The President of India authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. The Parliament of India authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary account where all government revenues are deposited.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the President does not directly authorize fund withdrawals.  Statement 2 is correct;  the Constitution explicitly states that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  This ensures parliamentary control over government spending.


**15. With reference to where all Union Government revenues are credited, consider the following:**

1. The Contingency Fund of India is where all revenues received by the Union Government are credited.
2. The Consolidated Fund of India is where all revenues received by the Union Government are credited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Government's financial system involves various funds and accounts.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Contingency Fund is a separate reserve fund for unforeseen expenditures, not the primary account for all government revenues.  Statement 2 is correct; all revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India, which is the primary account for government funds.  This ensures transparency and accountability in the management of public funds.


**16. With reference to India's "Look East Policy," consider the following statements:**

1. India aims to become a significant regional player in East Asian affairs through this policy.
2. India seeks to fill the power vacuum created by the end of the Cold War through this policy.
3. India aims to re-establish historical and cultural ties with Southeast and East Asian neighbors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's Look East Policy is a strategic initiative to enhance its engagement with East and Southeast Asia.  Statement 1 is correct; the policy aims to strengthen India's regional influence and partnerships.  Statement 2 is partially correct; while the end of the Cold War created opportunities, the policy's primary focus is not solely on filling a power vacuum but on broader economic and strategic cooperation.  Statement 3 is also correct; the policy seeks to revitalize historical and cultural links, fostering stronger relationships based on shared heritage and mutual interests.


**17. With reference to the consequences of non-passage of the Union Budget by the Lok Sabha, consider the following:**

1. The Budget is modified and re-presented to the Lok Sabha.
2. The Union Finance Minister is expected to resign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget's passage through Parliament is crucial for the government's functioning.  Statement 1 is incorrect; if the Lok Sabha rejects the Budget, it typically leads to the government's resignation, not a modification and re-presentation.  Statement 2 is largely correct; the failure to pass the Budget is a vote of no confidence, usually resulting in the resignation of the Council of Ministers, including the Finance Minister.  The Budget's approval is fundamental to the government's legitimacy and ability to operate.


**18. With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following:**

1. Voting in public elections is a Fundamental Duty.
2. Safeguarding public property is a Fundamental Duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are moral obligations enshrined in the Constitution.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while citizens are encouraged to vote, it is not explicitly stated as a Fundamental Duty.  Statement 2 is correct; safeguarding public property is one of the Fundamental Duties, reflecting the citizen's responsibility towards the nation's assets.  The Fundamental Duties aim to promote civic responsibility and national unity.


**19. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission facilitates the proper distribution of finances among Public Sector Undertakings.
2. The Finance Commission ensures transparency in financial administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's primary role is to recommend the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Finance Commission does not directly deal with the financial distribution among Public Sector Undertakings.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; while the Commission's recommendations promote fiscal transparency, it does not directly enforce transparency across all financial administration aspects.  The Commission's focus is primarily on intergovernmental fiscal relations.


**20. With reference to Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, consider the following:**

1. The Right to Education is a Human Right under the Universal Declaration.
2. The Right to Equal Access to Public Service is a Human Right under the Universal Declaration.
3. The Right to Food is a Human Right under the Universal Declaration.

Which of the above is/are Human Right(s)?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a landmark document outlining fundamental human rights.  All three statements are correct.  The UDHR explicitly recognizes the Right to Education (Article 26), the Right to Equal Access to Public Service (implied through principles of equality and non-discrimination), and the Right to Food (implied through the right to an adequate standard of living).  The UDHR's comprehensive approach covers a wide range of human rights, including social, economic, and political rights.


**21. With reference to Metropolitan Planning Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Metropolitan Planning Committees are established under the provisions of the Constitution.
2. Metropolitan Planning Committees solely implement government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Metropolitan Planning Committees are crucial for urban planning and development.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Metropolitan Planning Committees are not directly established through constitutional provisions.  They are established by law.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Metropolitan Planning Committees do not solely implement government schemes.  They prepare development plans, but the implementation involves various government agencies and stakeholders.  Their role is primarily in planning and coordination, not exclusive implementation.


**22. With reference to the difference between "vote-on-account" and "interim budget," consider the following:**

1. A vote-on-account is used by a regular government, while an interim budget is used by a caretaker government.
2. A vote-on-account deals only with expenditure, while an interim budget includes both expenditure and receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vote-on-account and interim budget are temporary financial provisions used during periods when a regular budget cannot be passed.  Statement 1 is correct; a vote-on-account is used when a new government needs time to prepare a full budget, while an interim budget is used by a caretaker government.  Statement 2 is also correct; a vote-on-account typically covers only government expenditure, while an interim budget includes both expenditure and revenue estimates.  Both mechanisms serve different purposes during transitional phases in government.


**23. With reference to the basis of power distribution between the Centre and States in the Indian Constitution, consider the following:**

1. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 laid down the scheme for power distribution.
2. The Government of India Act of 1935 laid down the scheme for power distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution's federal structure involves a complex distribution of powers between the Union and States.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Morley-Minto Reforms did not establish the framework for Centre-State relations.  Statement 2 is correct; the Government of India Act 1935, although not fully federal, laid down a significant part of the scheme for power distribution which was adopted, adapted, and improved upon in the 1950 Constitution.  The Act introduced features like a federal system, albeit with a strong central government, serving as a precursor to the Indian Constitution.


**24. With reference to the role and powers of Gram Sabhas under the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, consider the following:**

1. Gram Sabhas can prevent land alienation in Scheduled Areas.
2. Gram Sabhas own minor forest produce in Scheduled Areas.
3. Gram Sabha recommendations are required for granting prospecting licenses or mining leases in Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, aims to empower Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.  All three statements are correct.  The Act grants Gram Sabhas significant powers, including the prevention of land alienation, ownership of minor forest produce, and the authority to be consulted before granting any mining or prospecting licenses within their jurisdiction.  These provisions are designed to protect the rights and resources of tribal communities.


**25. With reference to the purpose of an adjournment motion in the Parliament of India, consider the following:**

1. An adjournment motion allows discussion on a matter of urgent public importance.
2. An adjournment motion allows opposition members to gather information from ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Adjournment motions are a parliamentary procedure used to raise urgent matters.  Statement 1 is correct; adjournment motions allow for the discussion of a definite matter of urgent public importance, potentially leading to the adjournment of the House’s proceedings.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the primary purpose is not information gathering but the immediate discussion of pressing issues.  Information gathering is a separate parliamentary process, not the core function of an adjournment motion.


**26. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and its consonance with constitutional provisions, consider the following:**

1. The Act is enacted in consonance with the Right to a Healthy Environment, interpreted as part of the Right to Life under Article 21.
2. The Act is enacted in consonance with the provisions for grants to raise administration levels in Scheduled Areas under Article 275(1).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, establishes a specialized tribunal to handle environmental cases.  Statement 1 is correct; the Act is consistent with the evolving interpretation of Article 21, which includes the Right to a Healthy Environment.  The Tribunal's establishment aims to provide speedy and effective environmental justice.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act's enactment is not directly linked to Article 275(1), which deals with grants for Scheduled Areas.  The Tribunal's jurisdiction is national, not limited to Scheduled Areas.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Principles outline the framework for socioeconomic democracy in India.
2. The provisions in the Directive Principles are not judicially enforceable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable guidelines for the state.  Statement 1 is correct; the Principles aim to establish a welfare state promoting social and economic justice, reflecting the ideal of socioeconomic democracy.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable in courts.  They serve as guidelines for policymaking and legislation, influencing judicial interpretation but not directly creating legally enforceable rights.


**28. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha's powers regarding Money Bills:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject or amend a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.
3. The Rajya Sabha cannot discuss the Annual Financial Statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Money Bills are related to the government's finances and have special procedures in Parliament.  Statement 1 is correct; the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) has limited powers regarding Money Bills. It can only review and suggest amendments but cannot reject or amend the bill.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect; although the Rajya Sabha cannot vote on Demands for Grants or pass the Annual Financial Statement (Budget), it can discuss and make suggestions on these matters.  The Lok Sabha (Lower House) holds primary power over financial matters.


**29. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. The Act clearly defined the jurisdiction of the central and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced significant constitutional reforms.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act did not establish a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature.  Statement 2 is correct; the Act introduced a diarchy (dual governance) system, dividing powers between the central and provincial governments.  This marked a step towards greater Indian participation in governance.


**30. When a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it must be passed by:**

(a) A simple majority of members present and voting.
(b) A three-fourths majority of members present and voting.
(c) A two-thirds majority of the total membership of both Houses.
(d) An absolute majority of the total membership of both Houses.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A joint sitting of Parliament is a rare procedure where both Houses meet together to resolve disagreements over a bill.  Statement (a) is correct; in a joint sitting, the bill requires a simple majority of the members present and voting to pass.  This is a significant difference from the ordinary legislative process where separate majorities in both Houses are required.  Options (b), (c), and (d) represent higher thresholds that are not required for passage in a joint sitting.


**31. The Government of India established NITI Aayog to replace the:**

(a) Human Rights Commission
(b) Finance Commission
(c) Law Commission
(d) Planning Commission

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank.  Statement (d) is correct; NITI Aayog was established in 2015 to replace the Planning Commission, which was responsible for centralized five-year plans.  NITI Aayog adopts a more cooperative and decentralized approach to policymaking, engaging with states and other stakeholders.  The other options are incorrect as they refer to distinct bodies with different functions.


**32. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union of India is vested in the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution defines the distribution of executive power in the Union.  Statement 1 is correct; the Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President, who exercises this power through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Prime Minister is not the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.  The Chairman is appointed separately.  The President’s role is paramount in the exercise of executive power, with the Prime Minister acting as the head of the government.


**33. The provisions in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India are primarily intended to:**

(a) Protect the interests of Scheduled Castes.
(b) Determine the boundaries between States.
(c) Determine the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats.
(d) Protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes in specific areas.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth and Sixth Schedules address the governance of specific areas and populations.  Statement (d) is correct; these Schedules make special provisions for the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in certain states, primarily focusing on their autonomy and protection of their rights and customs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect; while Panchayats are indirectly related, the Schedules' primary focus is on the unique administrative and governance arrangements for Scheduled Tribes and their territories.


**34. With reference to the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue prepares the Union Budget.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without Parliament's authorization.
3. All disbursements from the Public Account require Parliament's authorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary control over government finances is crucial.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Department of Economic Affairs, not the Department of Revenue, is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.  Statement 2 is correct; the Constitution mandates parliamentary authorization for withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while Parliament controls the Consolidated Fund, the Public Account operates under different rules, and not all disbursements require direct parliamentary approval.


**35. Who/Which of the following is the custodian of the Constitution of India?**

(a) The President of India
(b) The Prime Minister of India
(c) The Lok Sabha Secretariat
(d) The Supreme Court of India

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's role in upholding the Constitution is paramount.  Option (d) is correct; the Supreme Court, through its power of judicial review, interprets and protects the Constitution, acting as its ultimate guardian.  The President, Prime Minister, and Lok Sabha Secretariat have important roles in the government but not the direct responsibility of safeguarding and interpreting the Constitution as the Supreme Court does.


**36. Which one of the following was recently given classical language status?**

(a) Odia
(b) Konkani
(c) Bhojpuri
(d) Assamese

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Classical language status is conferred by the Government of India on languages that meet specific criteria.  Option (a) is correct; Odia was recently given classical language status, recognizing its rich history and literary heritage.  The other options are not yet conferred with classical language status.  This status grants additional government support for the preservation and promotion of the language.


**37. Consider the following statements:**

1. A State Legislative Council can be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

State Legislatures have either one or two Houses.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution sets a limit on the size of the Legislative Council; it cannot exceed one-third the size of the Legislative Assembly.  Statement 2 is correct; the Governor nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council from among its members.  The Governor plays a key role in the formation and functioning of the State Legislature.


**38. "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India" is a provision made in the:**

(a) Preamble of the Constitution
(b) Directive Principles of State Policy
(c) Fundamental Rights
(d) Fundamental Duties

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Preamble sets the tone and purpose of the Constitution.  Option (a) is correct; the phrase "To secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" is part of the Preamble.  This statement encapsulates the core goals of the Indian Constitution.


**

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Basic Structure Doctrine:**

1. The basic structure doctrine was first explicitly articulated in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
2.  Amendments to the Constitution that alter the basic structure are considered void by the judiciary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case is landmark in Indian constitutional law.  The Supreme Court, for the first time, explicitly formulated the "basic structure" doctrine, holding that Parliament's amending power under Article 368 is not unlimited and cannot alter the fundamental or basic features of the Constitution.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this historical fact.  Statement 2 is also correct because the core principle of the basic structure doctrine is that any constitutional amendment that violates the basic structure is void.  Subsequent cases have further refined the understanding of what constitutes the basic structure, but the core principle of judicial review to protect fundamental features remains.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. The Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable. While they are considered fundamental in the governance of the country, they are not legally enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards achieving social and economic justice.  Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Duties, added to the Constitution later, are also non-justiciable. They represent aspirational goals for citizens, but there's no legal mechanism to enforce them through courts. The difference between DPSPs and Fundamental Rights lies precisely in this justiciability aspect.


**3. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a federal system with a strong central government.
2.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is based solely on the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India has a quasi-federal system, leaning more towards a unitary structure than a purely federal one. The central government holds significant power, particularly in areas like finance and defense.  While the states have considerable autonomy, the Centre’s influence is substantial. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Government of India Act, 1935, served as a significant source of inspiration for the Indian Constitution's federal structure, it's not the sole basis.  The framers of the Indian Constitution drew upon various sources and adapted principles to create a unique system suited to India's specific context.  The distribution of powers is also shaped by judicial interpretations and constitutional amendments.


**4. Consider the following statements about the amendment of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The procedure for amending the Constitution is identical for all provisions.
2.  A special majority is required for amending all provisions of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't prescribe a single uniform procedure for all amendments. Different provisions have different amendment procedures, requiring varying majorities in Parliament.  Some provisions require only a simple majority, while others require a special majority (two-thirds of members present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House).  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While many constitutional amendments require a special majority, not all do.  The type of majority needed depends upon the specific provision being amended. The complexity of the amendment process reflects the framers’ intention to balance flexibility with stability.


**5. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in inter-state water disputes.
2. The Supreme Court of India can issue writs only to enforce Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction under Article 131 of the Constitution to hear and decide disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States. This includes inter-state water disputes. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court can issue writs to enforce Fundamental Rights, its writ jurisdiction is not limited to this.  It can issue writs (habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, quo warranto) to protect various legal rights and enforce other constitutional provisions.  The scope of the Supreme Court’s writ jurisdiction is broad and extends beyond Fundamental Rights.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Indian Parliament:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) plays a limited role in the passage of Money Bills.  It cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.  It can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha, which is not obligated to accept them. The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has the final say on Money Bills. Similarly, the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  It can only suggest amendments, but the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these suggestions.  The Constitution grants special powers to the Lok Sabha regarding Money Bills to ensure the government's financial authority.


**7. With reference to the Indian President, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can be removed from office through impeachment.
2. The President of India is solely responsible for the appointment of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India can be removed from office before the expiry of their term through impeachment by Parliament.  This is a serious process requiring a two-thirds majority in both Houses. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Prime Minister, the process is not entirely independent.  Conventionally, the person who commands the majority in the Lok Sabha is appointed.  The President's role is largely formal in this regard, reflecting the parliamentary system's conventions.  The President must act according to established norms and practices.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Panchayats and Municipalities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is generally correct. While the Election Commission of India (ECI) is currently a single-member body (the Chief Election Commissioner), it can be expanded to include other Election Commissioners. The Constitution allows for this, but currently the ECI functions with only one chief commissioner. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ECI conducts elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures. Elections to Panchayats and Municipalities are conducted by State Election Commissions, which are separate bodies established under state laws. This reflects the decentralized nature of local governance in India.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble to the Constitution is not a part of the Constitution.
2. The Preamble to the Constitution can be amended but its basic structure cannot be altered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Preamble is considered an integral part of the Constitution and reflects its philosophy and objectives.  It's a concise summary of the Constitution's spirit. Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble, like any other part of the Constitution, can be amended.  However, the basic structure doctrine protects the core principles enshrined in the Preamble and in the rest of the Constitution from being altered through amendments.  The Supreme Court has the power to review constitutional amendments, and if they violate the basic structure, they can be struck down.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor of a State holds office during the pleasure of the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India (Statement 1). The appointment is largely a formal process, but the President usually acts on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President (Statement 2). This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, though this power is rarely exercised and is typically done only in exceptional circumstances or following established conventions.  The Governor's position is largely nominal, though they have certain constitutional functions and powers in the State.


**11. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and enjoys a high degree of independence.  This independence is crucial for ensuring the CAG's impartiality in auditing government accounts. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend to both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures, respectively, and play a crucial role in ensuring government accountability and transparency in financial matters.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Union Council of Ministers:**

1. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The Union Council of Ministers is appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (Statement 1). This means the entire Council can be dismissed through a vote of no confidence in the Lok Sabha.  This principle of collective responsibility is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system.  The Union Council of Ministers is appointed by the President of India (Statement 2).  However, in practice, the Prime Minister selects the Ministers, and the President acts according to established conventions.  The President's role is largely formal in this respect, reflecting the parliamentary system's principles of responsible government.


**13. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2. Directive Principles of State Policy are enforceable by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute.  They are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, security, morality, etc., as specified in the Constitution itself. The Supreme Court interprets these restrictions, balancing individual rights with societal needs.  Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning courts cannot enforce them directly.  They serve as guidelines for the state to pursue social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is a key feature of the Indian Constitution.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can declare a law passed by Parliament as unconstitutional.
2. The Supreme Court of India has the power to amend the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, which allows it to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament or actions taken by the executive. If a law is found to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the Supreme Court can declare it void.  This power is crucial for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court interprets and applies the Constitution, but it does not have the power to amend it.  The power to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament, following the procedures laid down in Article 368.  The Supreme Court's role is to ensure that amendments are consistent with the basic structure of the Constitution.


**15. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States.
2. The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution contains laws that are immune from judicial review.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List, outlining the legislative powers of the Union and the States. This division of powers is a fundamental aspect of the Indian federal system. The Ninth Schedule was initially created to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review. However, the Supreme Court has subsequently limited the scope of this immunity.  While initially intended to shield certain laws from judicial scrutiny, the Ninth Schedule's effectiveness in this regard has been significantly reduced by subsequent judicial pronouncements.  Therefore, while technically some laws in the Ninth Schedule are shielded, the scope of such immunity is significantly reduced.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to freedom of religion is a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV, aim to establish a welfare state and are not justiciable.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 25 to Article 28 of Part III of the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of religion. This includes the freedom of conscience, the right to profess, practice, and propagate any religion, and the freedom to manage religious affairs.  This right is subject to certain reasonable restrictions imposed by the state in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), outlined in Part IV of the Constitution, represent the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve.  Unlike fundamental rights, these principles are not directly enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the government to formulate policies aimed at improving the social and economic conditions of the citizens.  The courts may, however, consider the DPSPs while interpreting fundamental rights or other laws, but they cannot directly enforce them.  This non-justiciable nature distinguishes DPSPs from fundamental rights.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Federal System:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, blending features of both federal and unitary systems.
2. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and acts as the nominal head of the state government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian federal system is often described as quasi-federal because it combines elements of both federal and unitary systems. While it features a division of powers between the Centre and the States, the central government enjoys significant dominance over the states in certain areas, especially during emergencies. This blend of federal and unitary features makes the Indian system unique and distinct from purely federal systems like the United States or purely unitary systems like the United Kingdom.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.  The Governor acts as the head of the state, but primarily plays a ceremonial role. The real executive power rests with the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers, who are responsible to the state legislature.  The Governor's role is largely symbolic and is often described as a constitutional head.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a special majority.
2. The Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List if it passes a resolution declaring that it is in the national interest.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 368 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution.  While most amendments require a special majority (two-thirds of the members present and voting in each House and the assent of the President), the Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights.  The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that certain basic features of the Constitution cannot be altered.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 249 of the Constitution empowers the Rajya Sabha to pass a resolution declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest that the Parliament should make laws on a matter included in the State List.  Once such a resolution is passed, the Parliament can enact laws on that subject, even if it falls within the purview of the State List.  This provision demonstrates the Parliament's overriding power in matters of national importance.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judiciary:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country and has the power of judicial review.
2. The High Courts in India have original jurisdiction in certain matters and appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts within their respective states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country and the final court of appeal.  It has original jurisdiction in certain specified matters, such as disputes between the Union and the States or between the States themselves.  Crucially, the Supreme Court possesses the power of judicial review, meaning it can declare laws or government actions unconstitutional if they violate the provisions of the Constitution. This power is a cornerstone of the Indian judicial system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The High Courts in India are the highest courts within their respective states or union territories. They have original jurisdiction in specific cases, such as writ petitions or election disputes.  They also exercise appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of lower courts within their territorial jurisdiction.  This two-tiered structure (original and appellate jurisdiction) is essential for the efficient and effective functioning of the Indian judicial system.


**5. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.
2. The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India for a fixed term.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Constitution. It is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President. The ECI's independence is crucial to ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and upholding democratic principles.  Its functions include preparing electoral rolls, delimiting constituencies, and overseeing the entire election process to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.  They hold office for a six-year term or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure ensures their independence and prevents undue political influence on their decisions. The President appoints them on the advice of the Council of Ministers.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments and submits reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG is appointed by the President of India, the CAG holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. The CAG cannot be removed from office except through impeachment by Parliament on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.  This secure tenure protects the CAG's independence and ensures that they can perform their duties without fear of political interference.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG audits the accounts of the Union Government and all State Governments.  The CAG submits audit reports to the Parliament on the accounts relating to the Union Government and to the State Legislatures on the accounts relating to the respective State Governments. These reports are crucial for ensuring financial accountability and transparency in government spending.


**7. With reference to the Union Budget of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister.
2.  The Union Budget includes both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union Budget, which outlines the government's financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister. This presentation marks the beginning of the budgetary process, which involves detailed scrutiny and approval by the Parliament.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Union Budget is broadly divided into two parts: the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget. The Revenue Budget deals with the government's receipts and expenditure related to revenue items such as taxes, grants, and subsidies.  The Capital Budget, on the other hand, pertains to capital receipts and expenditure related to capital items like investments, loans, and infrastructure development.  Both these components are integral parts of the Union Budget, providing a comprehensive picture of the government's financial position and plans.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs):**

1. PRIs are established under Part IX of the Constitution and are meant to promote democratic decentralization.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier system of PRIs in all states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Part IX of the Constitution of India deals with the Panchayats.  The establishment of PRIs aims to bring local self-government closer to the people, enabling greater participation in development and governance.  This is a cornerstone of democratic decentralization, empowering local communities to manage their own affairs.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, mandates the establishment of a three-tier system of PRIs (Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the intermediate level, and Zila Parishad at the district level) in all states. This act not only provides constitutional status to PRIs but also outlines their composition, powers, and functions.  However, states have some flexibility in adapting this three-tier model to their specific needs and circumstances.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties are incorporated in Part IV-A of the Constitution and are not enforceable by any court.
2.  The Swaran Singh Committee recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution, which was added through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. Unlike Fundamental Rights, these duties are not legally enforceable by courts. They are moral obligations on citizens to contribute towards the nation's progress and well-being.  The non-justiciable nature of these duties distinguishes them from the legally enforceable Fundamental Rights.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Swaran Singh Committee, appointed by the government, recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Constitution. This committee's recommendations were instrumental in shaping the list of Fundamental Duties that were eventually incorporated into the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment.  The committee's report highlighted the importance of civic duties in strengthening national unity and progress.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college consisting of elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies.
2. The President can be removed from office through impeachment by Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is elected indirectly by an electoral college. This college comprises elected members of both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States.  The method of election ensures a balance between the representation of the Union and the States in the presidential election process.  Nominated members of Parliament do not participate in the presidential election.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 61 of the Constitution provides for the impeachment of the President.  Impeachment is a process initiated in either House of Parliament, requiring a special majority vote to initiate the process and a two-thirds majority vote in both Houses to remove the President from office.  The grounds for impeachment include violation of the Constitution or commission of serious misconduct.  This process safeguards against abuse of power by the President and upholds the rule of law.


**11. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to promulgate ordinances when the State Legislature is not in session.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can remove the Governor at any time. This provision, however, is rarely invoked and is primarily meant to ensure that the Governor acts in accordance with the Constitution and the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor possesses the power to promulgate ordinances when the State Legislature is not in session.  These ordinances have the same force and effect as laws passed by the State Legislature but must be approved by the Legislature within six weeks of its reassembly. This power is meant to address urgent matters that cannot wait for the Legislature to convene.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Right to Information Act (RTI):**

1. The RTI Act empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities.
2. The Central Information Commission is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the RTI Act at the national level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation that promotes transparency and accountability in government.  The Act empowers citizens to seek information from public authorities on a wide range of matters, subject to certain exemptions.  This right is considered crucial for effective participation in democratic governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a statutory body established under the RTI Act. It is responsible for resolving complaints related to the denial of information by public authorities at the central level.  Similarly, State Information Commissions exist at the state level to address such complaints at the state level.  The CIC's role is vital in ensuring the effective implementation and enforcement of the RTI Act.


**13. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established to protect and promote human rights in India.
2. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action to the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established through the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and not through a constitutional provision.  While it plays a crucial role in protecting human rights, its establishment is based on legislation, not the Constitution itself.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial measures to the government. It receives complaints of human rights violations, conducts inquiries, and makes recommendations for appropriate action.  While its recommendations are not legally binding, they carry significant moral weight and influence government policy.  The NHRC's role is crucial in holding the government accountable for upholding human rights.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission of India:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years to review the financial relations between the Union and the States.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission by the President of India every five years or at such other intervals as the President may deem necessary. The Commission's primary function is to review the financial resources of the Union and the States and recommend the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and the grants-in-aid to the States.  This ensures a fair distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recommendations of the Finance Commission are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments. While the government generally accepts and implements the recommendations, it is not obligated to do so.  However, the Commission's recommendations are given significant weight due to its expertise and the importance of its role in maintaining fiscal balance and equity between the Union and the States.  The government's decision to deviate from the recommendations often requires strong justification.


**15. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body that replaced the Planning Commission.
2. NITI Aayog's primary function is to formulate five-year plans for national development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is not a constitutional body. It was established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission was not a constitutional body either, but NITI Aayog's establishment was also through executive action, not a constitutional amendment.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While NITI Aayog's primary function is to advise the government on development strategies and policies, it does not formulate five-year plans in the same way as the Planning Commission.  NITI Aayog's approach is more cooperative and collaborative, involving states and other stakeholders in the development process.  It focuses on a more flexible, outcome-oriented approach to development planning.


**1. With reference to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends to disputes between the Centre and one or more states, but excludes disputes arising from pre-Constitution treaties.
2.  The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction encompasses appeals from High Courts in all civil and criminal matters, irrespective of the monetary value involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court possesses exclusive original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and one or more states, or between states. However, this jurisdiction is explicitly limited; it does not extend to disputes stemming from pre-Constitution agreements or treaties, inter-state water disputes, or matters handled by the Finance Commission.  These exceptions are crucial to understanding the boundaries of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is broad, covering appeals from High Courts in both civil and criminal matters, it's not entirely unrestricted.  Historically, monetary limits existed for civil appeals, though these have been removed.  Further, the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases is contingent upon specific conditions, such as the nature of the sentence imposed by the High Court.  The statement's claim of unrestricted appeal in *all* civil and criminal matters is therefore inaccurate. The statement oversimplifies a complex jurisdictional landscape.


**2. With reference to the Advocates entitled to practice before the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Senior Advocates can independently file documents and appear before the Supreme Court without any junior advocate.
2.  Advocates-on-Record are exclusively responsible for filing all matters and documents before the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Senior Advocates hold a prestigious designation, they are *not* permitted to appear before the Supreme Court without an Advocate-on-Record.  This is a significant constraint on their practice, highlighting the hierarchical structure of the Supreme Court Bar. The statement misrepresents the role and limitations of Senior Advocates.

Statement 2 is correct.  Only Advocates-on-Record are authorized to file documents and matters before the Supreme Court. This underscores their unique and indispensable role in the functioning of the court.  They serve as the primary point of contact between the court and the parties involved in a case.  The statement accurately reflects the exclusive filing rights of Advocates-on-Record.


**3. With reference to the comparison between the Indian and American Supreme Courts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Supreme Court has a wider scope of judicial review compared to its American counterpart.
2.  Both the Indian and American Supreme Courts possess advisory jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The American Supreme Court possesses a significantly broader scope of judicial review than the Indian Supreme Court.  The American system allows for a more extensive review of legislative and executive actions, while the Indian system has specific limitations. This difference stems from differing constitutional frameworks and legal traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Supreme Court has advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 of the Constitution, allowing the President to seek its opinion on matters of law or fact of public importance. The American Supreme Court, however, lacks such advisory powers.  The statement wrongly attributes a similar characteristic to both courts.


**4.  With reference to the Articles of the Indian Constitution related to the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 124 deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court, while Article 141 declares the law declared by the Supreme Court to be binding on all courts.
2.  Article 125 pertains to the appointment of acting Chief Justices, whereas Article 136 deals with the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 124 of the Constitution outlines the establishment and composition of the Supreme Court. Article 141 explicitly states that the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts within India, highlighting the court's supreme authority in legal interpretation.  This statement accurately identifies the functions of these crucial articles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 125 deals with the salaries and allowances of the judges of the Supreme Court. Article 136 addresses the Supreme Court's power to grant special leave to appeal, a significant aspect of its appellate jurisdiction. Article 126 outlines the appointment of acting Chief Justices. The statement incorrectly assigns functions to the articles.



**5. With reference to the Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power of judicial review in India can be curtailed by a constitutional amendment.
2.  Judicial review extends to examining the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders at both the central and state levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court of India has established judicial review as a "basic feature" of the Constitution.  Therefore, it cannot be curtailed or abolished even through a constitutional amendment. This reflects the court's role in safeguarding the fundamental structure of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. Judicial review in India empowers the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive actions made by both the central and state governments. If these are found to violate the Constitution, they can be declared null and void. This statement accurately describes the scope of judicial review.


**6. With reference to the High Courts in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Each state in India has a separate High Court, with no provision for a common High Court serving multiple states.
2.  High Courts have appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters but lack original jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many states have their own High Courts, the Constitution allows for the establishment of a common High Court for two or more states. This provision reflects the flexibility built into the constitutional framework.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of the High Court structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. High Courts possess both appellate and original jurisdiction.  Their appellate jurisdiction involves hearing appeals from subordinate courts, while their original jurisdiction allows them to hear cases directly, without an initial hearing in a lower court.  The statement inaccurately limits the jurisdictional scope of the High Courts.


**7. With reference to the appointment of High Court Judges in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints High Court judges solely based on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.
2.  A person to be appointed as a judge of a High Court must have been an advocate of a High Court for at least 10 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints High Court judges, the process involves consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the concerned state.  Additionally, the Supreme Court's pronouncements on the collegium system have further shaped this process.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the complex appointment procedure.

Statement 2 is correct. One of the qualifications for appointment as a High Court judge is having been an advocate of a High Court (or High Courts in succession) for at least ten years.  Alternatively, they could have held a judicial office in India for ten years.  This statement accurately reflects the constitutional requirements.


**8. With reference to the Administrative Tribunals in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has exclusive jurisdiction over all service matters of central government employees, including members of the armed forces.
2. Appeals against the orders of the CAT lie only with the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAT handles a vast range of service matters for central government employees, its jurisdiction does *not* extend to members of the armed forces, Supreme Court staff, or Parliament's secretarial staff. The statement overstates the CAT's reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Following the *L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India* case (1997), appeals against CAT orders can be made to the High Court's division bench.  The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is not exclusive in this matter. The statement misrepresents the appellate process.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1. Union Territories, unlike states, do not share power with the Centre and are under its direct control.
2. The executive head of a Union Territory is always designated as a Lieutenant Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Union Territories are under the direct control of the Central government, unlike States which have a federal relationship with the Centre, sharing powers as defined in the Constitution.  Union Territories do not possess the same degree of autonomy as States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Lieutenant Governor is a common designation for the executive head of a Union Territory,  the title can vary.  Some Union Territories have an Administrator or a Chief Commissioner as their executive head.  The designation depends on the specific provisions made for that Union Territory in the Constitution or by subsequent legislation.  The diversity in the administrative structure of Union Territories reflects the varying levels of autonomy granted to them.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the legislative powers concerning Union Territories:**

1. Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List for Union Territories without any restrictions.
2.  The Governor of a Union Territory has the power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parliament's legislative power extends to all three lists (Union, State, and Concurrent) for Union Territories.  Unlike States, where Parliament's power over State List subjects is limited,  in Union Territories, Parliament has unrestricted legislative competence. This is a significant difference in the constitutional framework governing States and Union Territories.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of the legislature rests with the Administrator (or Lieutenant Governor, etc.) of the Union Territory, not the Governor. The Governor is a constitutional head of a State, not a Union Territory. This distinction is crucial for understanding the administrative and legislative differences between states and Union Territories.


**3. With reference to the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule applies to all states in India, providing a uniform administrative framework for Scheduled Areas.
2. The President of India, in consultation with the Governor of the concerned state, can alter the boundaries of a Scheduled Area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in States, *except* Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These four Northeastern states are governed by the Sixth Schedule.  Therefore, the Fifth Schedule does not provide a uniform administrative framework across all states. The differing provisions highlight the unique challenges and administrative needs of different regions within India.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to declare, increase, decrease, alter boundaries, or rescind the designation of Scheduled Areas. This power is exercised in consultation with the Governor of the respective state, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian Constitution while acknowledging the Centre's role in protecting tribal interests.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Autonomous Districts established under the Sixth Schedule are entirely outside the executive authority of the concerned state.
2. The Governor can establish separate autonomous regions within an autonomous district if there are multiple tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Autonomous Districts under the Sixth Schedule enjoy significant autonomy, they are not entirely outside the executive authority of the concerned state. The state government retains ultimate executive power, although the District Councils have considerable administrative and legislative powers within their jurisdiction.  The balance between state authority and autonomy for tribal areas is a key feature of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor is empowered to reorganize the autonomous districts, including dividing a district into multiple autonomous regions if the presence of different tribes necessitates it. This provision aims to cater to the diverse needs and identities of various tribal groups within a particular geographical area.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA):**

1. PESA mandates that all seats of Chairpersons of Panchayats at all levels in Scheduled Areas must be reserved for Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PESA ensures adequate representation for Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats within Scheduled Areas.  This is a crucial aspect of empowering tribal communities and ensuring their participation in local governance. The reservation of Chairperson positions reflects a commitment to tribal self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PESA extends the provisions of Part IX but with *modifications* to suit the specific context of Scheduled Areas and to respect traditional customs and practices.  The Act explicitly allows for exceptions and modifications to ensure that the panchayat system aligns with the unique social, cultural, and administrative realities of tribal communities.  The flexibility built into PESA is essential for its effective implementation.


**6. With reference to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of Panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels is a voluntary provision under the Act.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The establishment of Panchayats at the three levels (village, intermediate, and district) is a *compulsory* provision under the 73rd Amendment Act. This is a fundamental aspect of the Act's aim to establish a three-tier Panchayati Raj system across the country.  The mandatory nature of this provision reflects the constitutional commitment to decentralization of power.

Statement 2 is correct.  The reservation of at least one-third of seats for women in Panchayats is a *compulsory* provision of the 73rd Amendment. This is a key step towards ensuring women's participation in local governance and promoting gender equality.  The mandatory nature of this provision underscores the importance of women's representation in decision-making processes.


**7. With reference to the provisions related to municipalities in India, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The State Finance Commission plays a crucial role in the financial health of municipalities.  It reviews their financial position and makes recommendations regarding the financial resources available to them, including the types of taxes and duties they can levy. The commission's role is to ensure a balance between the financial needs of municipalities and the overall fiscal framework of the state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Central government has a role in providing guidelines, the state legislature primarily decides the maintenance of accounts and auditing procedures for municipalities. This reflects the principle of federalism, giving states significant autonomy in managing their local government affairs. The state's role is vital for adapting the municipal financial management system to local needs and circumstances.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the composition of District Planning Committees:**

1. At least half of the members of a District Planning Committee must be elected members of the District Panchayat.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act stipulates that four-fifths of the members of a District Planning Committee should be elected members of the district panchayat and municipalities, with the representation proportional to the rural and urban populations.  This ensures a balance between rural and urban interests in district-level planning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The manner of electing the Chairperson of the District Planning Committee is determined by the state legislature, not by the Governor's direct appointment. The state legislature's role ensures that the process aligns with the state's overall administrative framework and local governance structures.  The state's autonomy in this matter is crucial to the effective functioning of District Planning Committees.


**9. With reference to Metropolitan Planning Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. Two-thirds of the members of a Metropolitan Planning Committee must be elected members of municipalities within the metropolitan area.
2.  The Central government plays a leading role in preparing the draft development plan for the metropolitan area.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act mandates that two-thirds of the members of a Metropolitan Planning Committee are elected members of municipalities and chairpersons of panchayats within the metropolitan area.  This ensures that local representatives have a significant voice in shaping the development plan for their area.  The proportional representation reflects a commitment to local participation in urban planning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Central government's objectives and priorities are considered, the primary responsibility for preparing the draft development plan rests with the Metropolitan Planning Committee itself.  The state government also plays a significant role, and the committee must consult with various institutions and organizations. The collaborative approach reflects the multi-layered nature of urban governance in India.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the reservation of seats in municipalities:**

This provision aims to ensure that these marginalized communities are adequately represented in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The procedure for maintaining accounts and auditing them in municipalities is determined by the *state legislature*, not the President of India. The state legislature's role reflects the federal structure of the Indian Constitution, allowing states significant autonomy in managing their local government affairs. The state's autonomy is crucial for adapting municipal accounting and auditing practices to local needs and circumstances.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then advises the President on the appointment of other Ministers.  The President acts on this advice.

Statement 2 is also correct. The principle of collective responsibility means the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament). If the Lok Sabha loses confidence in the government, the entire Council of Ministers must resign.  While the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) can't directly bring down the government, its scrutiny and debates influence public opinion and indirectly impact the government's stability.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Panchayats,  it doesn't apply uniformly across all states.  Some states may have specific exceptions or modifications to this provision based on their unique circumstances. The  reservation is based on the proportion of SC and ST population in that particular state.  The specific details of implementation are left to the individual states.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, a landmark legislation, introduced Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) with a constitutional status. A key provision of this Act is the reservation of seats for SCs and STs in PRIs, aiming for proportionate representation based on their population in the respective areas.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Its members are experts in finance and related fields, chosen for their expertise and impartiality. The Commission maintains independence from state governments to ensure objective assessments and recommendations.

Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete. While the Finance Commission does review the financial position of Panchayats (as part of its broader mandate), its primary function extends beyond Panchayats. It's concerned with the overall financial balance between the Union and the states, including the distribution of tax revenues and the grant-in-aid.  The Commission's role in relation to Panchayats is a significant aspect, but not its sole focus.


**3. With reference to constitutional authorities in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Electoral Officer is a constitutional authority responsible for conducting elections at the state level.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State Electoral Officer is an important administrative official involved in election processes but is not a constitutional authority in the same way as the Election Commission of India. Constitutional authorities derive their powers directly from the Constitution of India, often having specific articles dedicated to their establishment and functions. The State Electoral Officer's role is defined by laws and regulations framed under the Constitution but not directly by the Constitution itself.


Statement 2 is correct. While Panchayats play a significant role in India's governance structure, they are not classified as constitutional authorities.  Their establishment and functions are defined by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, but they don't have the same constitutional standing as bodies directly mentioned and empowered by the Constitution itself.  Constitutional authorities typically involve independent bodies with specific powers and responsibilities explicitly outlined in the Constitution, such as the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General, etc.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 371 does include special provisions for several states,  it doesn't exclusively or primarily focus on the administration of tribal areas for Maharashtra and Gujarat.  The specific provisions under Article 371 vary from state to state, addressing their unique needs and circumstances.  Some states might have provisions related to tribal administration, while others might have provisions related to other matters like language, education, or administrative structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The core purpose of Article 371 is to safeguard the distinct cultural, linguistic, and administrative aspects of certain states. These provisions recognize the diversity within India and aim to accommodate the specific requirements of states with unique characteristics.  This approach ensures that the constitutional framework is flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of all states without compromising the overall unity of the nation.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State Election Commission's responsibilities extend to both Panchayat and Municipal elections.  The preparation of electoral rolls is a crucial function for both levels of local body elections.  The Commission's role in ensuring free and fair elections is vital for the democratic functioning of both Panchayats and Municipalities.

Statement 2 is correct. The State Election Commission (SEC) is an independent body established under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts. It's responsible for conducting elections for Panchayats and Municipalities in the respective states.  This ensures impartiality and prevents political interference in the election process at the local level.  The SEC's role is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of local body elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Union Finance Commission's recommendations significantly impact local body finances (indirectly), it is not directly tasked with providing financial assistance to them. Its primary focus is on the distribution of resources between the Union and the states. While its recommendations can influence the allocation of funds to states, which in turn may be used for local bodies, there is no direct, mandated provision for the Commission to provide financial assistance to local bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Local government remains primarily a state subject even after the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments. While these amendments granted constitutional status to Panchayats and Municipalities, they did not alter the fundamental position of local government as a state subject. The amendments aimed to strengthen local governance within the existing framework, not to shift its constitutional standing.  The Union's role is primarily limited to providing guidance and financial assistance to the states, which then implement the policies at the local level.


**7.  With reference to the provisions for reservation of seats in municipal areas, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reservation of seats for SCs and STs in municipal areas is determined based on their population proportion relative to the total population of the state.
2.  One-third of the total seats in municipal bodies are reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The reservation of seats for SCs and STs in municipal areas is based on their population proportion relative to the total population of the *municipal area*, not the entire state.  The principle of proportionate representation applies to the specific geographical area of the municipality, reflecting the demographic composition of that particular region.  This ensures that the representation within the municipal body accurately reflects the community composition of the area it serves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While one-third of the seats are reserved for women, this reservation is *in addition* to the seats already reserved for SC and ST women.  The reservation for women is an independent provision designed to enhance women's participation in local governance. The combined reservation for women and other reserved categories does not exceed 50% of the total seats. This ensures that while women's representation is boosted, other communities still have their proportionate representation.



**8.  With reference to the office of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can remove the Governor at any time.
2.  The Governor's power to appoint the Chief Minister is subject to the advice of the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, although this power is rarely exercised. The President's power to dismiss the Governor is a reflection of the principle of executive supremacy at the national level.  However, in practice, the dismissal of a Governor requires significant political considerations and typically only occurs in exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor's power to appoint the Chief Minister is not subject to the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister based on his/her assessment of who commands the majority support in the Legislative Assembly.  While the Governor consults with various stakeholders, the final decision rests with the Governor.  This independence is crucial for ensuring that the appointment of the Chief Minister is not influenced by partisan political considerations.


**9. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.  A Money Bill, dealing with financial matters, enjoys special status in the Indian parliamentary system.  The Lok Sabha, being the directly elected House, holds primary authority over financial legislation.  The Rajya Sabha can only suggest amendments to a Money Bill but cannot reject it.  This reflects the principle of financial supremacy vested in the directly elected House.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, not actually amend, a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and suggesting changes, which the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject.  This provision ensures the efficient passage of financial legislation while recognizing the Upper House's role in the process.


**10. With reference to the functions of the Estimates Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to enhance administrative efficiency and economy.
2. The Estimates Committee examines whether the money allocated for a particular service has been spent within the limits of the policy for that service.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Estimates Committee, a parliamentary committee, scrutinizes the government's budget proposals.  A key function is to suggest improvements in administrative efficiency and economy in government spending.  The committee analyzes the government's plans, identifies areas of potential waste or inefficiency, and proposes alternative approaches to optimize resource utilization.  The committee's recommendations are valuable for enhancing public financial management.

Statement 2 is correct. The Estimates Committee examines whether funds have been used according to the intended policies.  The committee ensures that the money allocated for specific services is spent in accordance with the stated objectives and doesn't deviate from the approved plans.  This ensures accountability in public spending and prevents misuse of funds.  This function contributes to good governance and transparency in financial matters.



**11. With reference to the Gram Nyayalaya Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction to hear only civil cases, excluding criminal cases.
2. The Gram Nyayalaya Act explicitly allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases, but with certain limitations on the types and value of cases they can handle.  The primary aim of establishing Gram Nyayalayas is to provide accessible and affordable justice at the village level.  This necessitates handling both civil and criminal matters that commonly arise in rural communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Nyayalaya Act recognizes the importance of local participation in dispute resolution. It allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators in order to promote amicable settlements and reduce the burden on the formal judicial system.  This approach aligns with the principles of alternative dispute resolution and aims to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of justice in rural areas.


**12. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List, even without a resolution from the Rajya Sabha, if deemed necessary in the national interest.
2. The Parliament’s power to legislate on State List items is subject to specific conditions and safeguards outlined in the Constitution.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament cannot legislate on any item in the State List without a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha.  The Constitution's federal structure safeguards the autonomy of states.  The Parliament can only legislate on matters in the State List under specific circumstances, primarily when a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha, declaring that the matter is of national importance.  This procedural safeguard prevents the Parliament from encroaching on the powers of the states without their consent.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Parliament's power to legislate on subjects in the State List is not absolute. It's subject to specific conditions, primarily the passage of a Rajya Sabha resolution declaring the subject to be of national importance.  The Constitution carefully balances the powers of the Union and the states, ensuring that the states' autonomy is not undermined without due process.  These safeguards are crucial for maintaining the federal balance within the Indian constitutional framework.


**13. With reference to the minimum age for Panchayat members, consider the following statements:**

1. The minimum age for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act has established a uniform minimum age for Panchayat members across all states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years. This is stipulated by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.  This age requirement reflects the understanding that individuals below this age may lack the maturity and experience necessary for effective participation in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act sets a minimum age, it doesn't mandate a uniform age across all states. The Act provides a basic framework and leaves some details of implementation to the state governments.  Some states might have their own specific regulations regarding the minimum age, though they cannot go below the constitutional minimum of 21 years.  This allows for some flexibility in addressing the specific needs and circumstances of different states.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are *non-justiciable*, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  The non-justiciable nature of these principles allows the state flexibility in adapting its policies to changing circumstances without being constrained by immediate judicial intervention.  However, the courts can consider them while interpreting other provisions of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are intended to build a socio-economic democracy in India. They aim to establish a society where social and economic inequalities are minimized and where the welfare of citizens is prioritized. The principles cover a range of issues, including social security, education, healthcare, and economic equality.  They represent the aspirational goals of the Indian Constitution, guiding the state towards a more equitable and just society.


**15. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission of India.
2. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) replaced the Planning Commission of India in 2015.  This change reflected a shift in the government's approach to economic planning, moving from a centralized, command-and-control model to a more cooperative and decentralized framework.  NITI Aayog aims to foster greater collaboration between the central government, state governments, and other stakeholders in the development process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is not a constitutional body. It was established by a resolution of the government, not through a constitutional amendment.  While its functions are significant for national development, it does not derive its authority directly from the Constitution of India. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in its functioning compared to a constitutionally mandated body.  The government can modify its structure and functions through executive decisions without requiring constitutional amendments.



**16.  Consider the following statements regarding the executive power of the Union:**

1. The executive power of the Union is vested in the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President, not the Prime Minister.  While the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers and exercises significant executive authority, the ultimate executive power rests with the President.  This reflects the principle of separation of powers, where the President acts as the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister is the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.  This Board plays a crucial role in matters related to the Indian Civil Services, including appointments, promotions, and disciplinary actions.  The Prime Minister's role as Chairman reflects the importance of the Civil Services in the functioning of the government and the need for high-level oversight in these matters.


**17. With reference to the provisions in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in four northeastern states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of Tribal Advisory Councils in states with Scheduled Areas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states *except* Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The Sixth Schedule addresses the administration of tribal areas specifically in these four northeastern states.  The different approaches reflect the unique characteristics and needs of tribal communities in different regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Fifth Schedule mandates the establishment of Tribal Advisory Councils in states with Scheduled Areas.  These councils play a vital role in advising the state government on matters concerning the welfare and advancement of Scheduled Tribes.  Their involvement is crucial for ensuring that the policies and programs implemented in Scheduled Areas are responsive to the needs of the tribal communities.


**18. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue is involved in the budget process, it is not the sole body responsible for preparing the Union Budget.  The preparation of the budget involves multiple departments and agencies within the Ministry of Finance, including the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Expenditure.  The Finance Minister plays a central role in coordinating the budget preparation process, ensuring consistency and coherence across different parts of the budget.

Statement 2 is correct.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.  The Consolidated Fund is the primary source of government funds.  The Parliament's authorization is a crucial safeguard against unauthorized spending and ensures accountability in public finance.  This principle is fundamental to the democratic functioning of the government, ensuring that public funds are used in accordance with the wishes of the elected representatives.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the Legislative Council of a State:**

1. The Legislative Council of a State can be larger in size than half of the Legislative Assembly of that State.
2. The Governor of a State nominates one-third of the members of the Legislative Council.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Legislative Council of a State cannot be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly of that State.  The Constitution of India sets a limit on the size of the Legislative Council relative to the Legislative Assembly, ensuring that the Upper House does not overshadow the directly elected Lower House. This reflects the principle of democratic accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor does nominate some members to the Legislative Council, but it's not one-third.  The members of the Legislative Council are elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly, graduates of certain universities, and also nominated by the Governor.  The Governor's power of nomination is limited and intended to ensure representation for experts and specialists in various fields.  The exact proportion of nominated members varies based on the specific state's Legislative Council composition.


**20. Consider the following statements about the fundamental object(s) of the Panchayati Raj system:**

1. The Panchayati Raj system aims to ensure people's participation in development.
2. The Panchayati Raj system is primarily focused on financial mobilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. One of the primary objectives of the Panchayati Raj system is to ensure people's participation in development.  This is a cornerstone of democratic decentralization.  By involving local communities in the decision-making process, the Panchayati Raj system enhances transparency, accountability, and effectiveness in development programs.  It promotes local ownership of development initiatives, leading to more sustainable and contextually relevant outcomes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While financial mobilization is an important aspect of the Panchayati Raj system, it's not its primary focus.  The system's main aim is to empower local communities and enable them to participate in decision-making regarding their own development.  Financial mobilization is a means to achieve this broader objective, ensuring that local bodies have the resources to implement development programs effectively.  The emphasis is on participatory development, not solely on resource generation.



**1. With reference to the provisions related to reservation of seats in Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population in the total population of the Panchayat area.
2.  One-third of the total seats in Panchayats are reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC/ST women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, introduced several provisions for Panchayati Raj institutions, including those related to reservations.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a key provision: reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) is mandatory, and the proportion of reserved seats must correspond to the population ratio of SCs and STs within the relevant Panchayat area. This ensures representation for these historically marginalized communities.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act mandates that at least one-third of the total seats in all Panchayats at all three levels (village, intermediate, and district) be reserved for women.  This reservation is in addition to the seats reserved for SC/ST women, meaning that a seat can be reserved for both a woman and an SC/ST member simultaneously. This provision aims to enhance women's political participation and leadership in rural governance. Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of the 73rd Amendment Act's provisions on seat reservations in Panchayats.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the financial aspects of Panchayats:**

1.  The procedure for maintenance of accounts and audit of Panchayat funds is determined by the State Legislature.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act empowers Panchayats to levy, collect, and appropriate certain taxes, duties, tolls, and fees.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the 73rd Amendment Act aims to strengthen the financial autonomy of Panchayats, the specifics regarding accounting and audit procedures are not directly dictated by the Act itself.  Instead, Statement 1 is correct as the State Legislature is empowered to determine the procedures for maintaining accounts and conducting audits of Panchayat funds. This allows for flexibility in adapting procedures to suit the specific context and resources of each state.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does not automatically grant Panchayats the power to levy, collect, and appropriate all taxes, duties, tolls, and fees.  While the Act encourages the devolution of financial powers to Panchayats, the specific taxes and the extent of these powers are determined by State legislation.  States have the discretion to grant specific tax-levying powers to Panchayats, within the framework of the Act.  Therefore, only Statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional framework.


**3. With reference to the structure of Panchayati Raj institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates a three-tier system of Panchayats in all states, consisting of village, intermediate, and district level Panchayats.
2.  States with a population not exceeding 20 lakh are not required to establish Panchayats at the intermediate level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act aims to establish a uniform structure for Panchayati Raj institutions across India.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect because while it promotes a three-tier system (village, intermediate, district), it does not *mandate* this structure for all states. The Act allows for flexibility, particularly for smaller states.  Statement 2 correctly identifies an exception: states with a population of less than 20 lakh are not obligated to establish Panchayats at the intermediate level.  This provision acknowledges that the optimal structure of Panchayati Raj may vary depending on the size and population distribution of a state. The focus is on establishing effective local governance structures, not necessarily adhering strictly to a three-tier model in all cases.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the powers and functions of the Gram Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gram Sabha comprises all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village within the area of a village-level Panchayat.
2.  The powers and functions of the Gram Sabha are exclusively defined in the 73rd Amendment Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Sabha is a crucial component of the Panchayati Raj system established by the 73rd Amendment Act. Statement 1 accurately describes its composition: it comprises all registered voters in the electoral rolls of a village falling within the jurisdiction of a village-level Panchayat. This ensures broad-based participation at the grassroots level.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does not exhaustively define the powers and functions of the Gram Sabha.  While the Act establishes the Gram Sabha as a vital body, the specific powers and functions it can exercise are left to be determined by the State Legislature through State laws.  This allows for flexibility in adapting the role of the Gram Sabha to the specific needs and context of different states and localities. Therefore, only Statement 1 is a correct representation of the Gram Sabha's constitutional framework.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the tenure of Panchayats:**

1.  Panchayats at all levels have a fixed tenure of five years.
2.  If a Panchayat is dissolved before the completion of its five-year term, fresh elections must be held within six months.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act aims to ensure the continuity and stability of Panchayati Raj institutions.  Statement 1 is correct: the Act mandates a fixed five-year term for Panchayats at all three levels (village, intermediate, and district). This provides a predictable timeframe for planning and implementation of development programs.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Act includes a crucial provision to safeguard against prolonged periods without elected representatives.  If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, for whatever reason, the State is obligated to conduct fresh elections within a period of six months. This ensures that the democratic process is not disrupted for an extended duration.  Both statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions regarding the tenure and continuity of Panchayats.


**6. With reference to the  74th Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act provides for the constitution of Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas.
2.  The Act mandates periodic elections to municipalities every five years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, deals with the constitution and functioning of municipalities in urban areas. Statement 1 is correct: a key feature of the Act is the provision for the establishment of Nagar Panchayats to govern smaller urban areas. This addresses the need for local governance structures in areas that may not meet the criteria for larger municipalities or municipal corporations.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Similar to the 73rd Amendment's provisions for Panchayats, the 74th Amendment mandates regular elections for municipalities, with a fixed five-year term.  This ensures regular democratic accountability and participation in urban governance.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the provisions of the 74th Amendment Act.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning reservation of seats in Municipalities:**

1.  The 74th Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population in the municipal area.
2.  One-third of the total seats in Municipalities are reserved for women, excluding the seats already reserved for SC/ST women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 74th Amendment Act, like the 73rd Amendment, incorporates provisions for reservations to ensure representation for marginalized communities and women in urban governance. Statement 1 correctly states that the Act mandates reservation of seats for SCs and STs in municipalities, proportionate to their population in the municipal area. This mirrors the principle applied in Panchayats, aiming for inclusive representation.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act stipulates that at least one-third of the total seats in all municipalities be reserved for women.  Crucially, this reservation is in addition to any seats already reserved for SC/ST women.  A seat can thus be simultaneously reserved for both a woman and an SC/ST candidate.  This reinforces the commitment to gender equality in urban local governance.  Both statements accurately describe the provisions of the 74th Amendment concerning seat reservations.


**8. With reference to the Governor's role in relation to State legislation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India.
2. The Governor can return a bill passed by the State Legislature for reconsideration by the Legislature.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state plays a significant role in the legislative process.  Statement 1 is correct: the Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature.  This power is particularly exercised when a bill raises issues of national importance, involves significant financial implications, or potentially conflicts with the powers of the Union Government.  The reserved bill is then sent to the President for consideration and assent. Statement 2 is also correct: the Governor can return a bill passed by the State Legislature to the Legislature for reconsideration. This power is typically used when the Governor has reservations about specific provisions of the bill.  The Legislature can then either accept the Governor's suggestions or pass the bill again in its original form. The Governor can then either assent to the bill or reserve it for the President.  Both statements accurately reflect the Governor's powers related to State legislation.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Chief Minister's position:**

1. The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor.
2. The Council of Ministers in a State holds office during the pleasure of the Governor.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chief Minister's position is central to the functioning of a State Government. Statement 1 is correct:  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister. While the Governor technically has the power of appointment, in practice, the person commanding a majority in the State Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister.  Statement 2 is also correct: The Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister, holds office during the pleasure of the Governor.  This means that the Governor can dismiss the Council of Ministers, although this power is exercised only under exceptional circumstances, typically when the Council loses the confidence of the Legislative Assembly. Both statements accurately reflect the constitutional relationship between the Governor and the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers.


**10. With reference to the Union Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament.
2. The Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is the executive arm of the Union Government.  Statement 1 is correct: a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy is the principle of collective responsibility.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  This means that if the Lok Sabha expresses a lack of confidence in the Council, the entire Council must resign.  Statement 2 is also correct: Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.  While the President appoints the Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, the President can dismiss a Minister if advised to do so by the Prime Minister.  Both statements accurately reflect the constitutional position of the Union Council of Ministers.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the reservation of one-third of the total seats in Panchayats at all levels for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.
2.  The maintenance of accounts and audit procedures for Panchayats are exclusively determined by the State Governor, overriding any other legislative provisions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, mandates at least one-third reservation for women in Panchayats at all three levels. This reservation is in addition to the reservation for SC and ST women, ensuring their representation.  The act aims to enhance women's political participation and empower them at the grassroots level.  This is a key provision aimed at achieving gender equality and social justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the State Governor plays a significant role in the overall governance framework, the 73rd Amendment Act doesn't grant them exclusive authority to determine the maintenance of accounts and audit procedures for Panchayats.  These are typically governed by state legislation, subject to the overall constitutional framework and the guidelines of the State Finance Commission.  The State legislature has the primary power to frame rules and regulations concerning the financial management of Panchayats.  The Governor's role is more of oversight and ensuring compliance with existing laws.


**2. With reference to the provisions related to Nagar Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of Nagar Panchayats is exclusively mandated for smaller urban areas, excluding larger cities and metropolitan regions.
2.  Periodic elections for Nagar Panchayats must be held every five years to ensure democratic accountability and representation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nagar Panchayats are typically established for smaller urban areas to provide basic civic amenities and governance structures.  Larger urban areas usually have Municipalities or Municipal Corporations with more extensive administrative capacities and responsibilities. This distinction is crucial for efficient urban planning and resource allocation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, which deals with Municipalities, emphasizes the importance of regular elections to ensure the democratic functioning of urban local bodies.  The five-year cycle is intended to provide continuity and accountability in urban governance.  Regular elections prevent the concentration of power and maintain a dynamic representation of the citizenry's needs and aspirations.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Governor concerning urban local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor has the sole authority to decide the procedure for maintenance of accounts and audit of Nagar Panchayats, Municipalities, and Municipal Corporations.
2. The Governor appoints the Chairpersons of all Ward Committees across all urban local bodies in a state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Governor's role in state governance is significant, they do not possess the exclusive authority to determine the accounting and audit procedures for all urban local bodies. These are usually determined by state legislation, with some provisions outlined in the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. The State Legislature holds the primary power to frame the rules and regulations governing the financial administration of urban local bodies. The Governor’s role is primarily one of oversight and ensuring the adherence to existing laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The method of appointing Chairpersons of Ward Committees varies across states and is usually determined by state legislation, often involving elections by the Ward Council members. While the Governor holds the executive power of the state, the appointment of Ward Committee Chairpersons is not a direct responsibility vested exclusively with them.  The 74th Amendment Act allows for flexibility in the composition and functioning of Ward Committees.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the reservation of seats in urban local bodies:**

1. Seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in urban local bodies in proportion to their population in the municipal area.
2. One-third of the total seats in urban local bodies are reserved for women, excluding the seats already reserved for SC and ST women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, mandates reservation of seats for SCs and STs in urban local bodies, mirroring the principle of proportional representation based on their population in the municipal area. This is a crucial step in ensuring inclusive governance and addressing historical inequalities.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act also mandates that at least one-third of the total seats in urban local bodies be reserved for women. This reservation is in addition to any seats already reserved for SC and ST women, further promoting gender equality in urban governance. This provision reflects a commitment to increasing women's participation in local decision-making processes.


**5. With reference to the constitutional provisions related to the Governor's role, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is the de jure head of the state administration, while the Chief Minister is the de facto head.
2. The Governor's tenure is during the pleasure of the President of India, meaning they can be removed at any time by the President.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor is the constitutional or de jure head of the state, representing the Union government at the state level. However, the Chief Minister, as the head of the elected government, holds the real or de facto executive power. This arrangement reflects the federal structure of India's governance system, balancing the Union and the State's authority.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution empowers the President to remove the Governor from office at any time, though this power is generally exercised only under exceptional circumstances.  The "pleasure of the President" clause provides a mechanism for maintaining consistency between the Union and the States, allowing for the removal of Governors who may not be acting in accordance with the Union's interests or constitutional principles.  This is a mechanism for maintaining a balance of power within the federal structure.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):**

1. The CAG is solely accountable to the Parliament and not to the Executive branch of the government.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments. Their independence from the Executive is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in public finances.  The CAG reports directly to the Parliament, enabling legislative oversight of government spending.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments, they do not compile and maintain these accounts. The respective governments maintain their own accounts, and the CAG audits them to ensure accuracy, regularity, and compliance with financial regulations. The CAG's role is primarily auditing and not record-keeping.


**7. With reference to the functioning of the Estimates Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to enhance administrative efficiency and economy.
2. The Estimates Committee examines whether the money allocated is spent within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Estimates Committee, a parliamentary committee, plays a vital role in scrutinizing government expenditure and promoting efficiency.  A key function is to suggest policy improvements and alternative approaches to achieve better outcomes with existing resources.  Their recommendations are aimed at enhancing public policy and resource management.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core function of the Estimates Committee is to examine whether the funds allocated by Parliament are used effectively and for the intended purposes, as reflected in the government's estimates.  They investigate the efficiency and economy of government spending and identify areas for improvement.  This scrutiny enhances the accountability of the executive branch.


**8.  With reference to the recommendations of the Balwantray Mehta Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee recommended that the District Collector should be the chairman of the Zila Parishad.
2. The Committee advocated for the Panchayat Samiti to function as the executive body at the intermediate level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Balwantray Mehta Committee, which played a pivotal role in shaping the Panchayati Raj system, recommended that the District Collector should chair the Zila Parishad. This reflected the committee's emphasis on the role of the administrative machinery in guiding and supporting the Panchayati Raj institutions.  However, subsequent reforms have changed this structure in many states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Committee recommended a three-tier structure for Panchayati Raj – Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad.  The Panchayat Samiti was envisioned as the executive body at the intermediate level, responsible for implementing development plans and coordinating activities within its jurisdiction.  This structure aimed at ensuring effective implementation of policies at the local level.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act:**

1. The Act makes the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system compulsory in all states, irrespective of their population size.
2. The Act mandates the direct election of all members of Panchayats at all three levels.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act promotes a three-tier Panchayati Raj system, it does allow for exceptions. States with populations below 20 lakhs are not required to have an intermediate level of Panchayats. This provision acknowledges the varying demographic and geographical realities across Indian states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly mandates the direct election of all members of Panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels. This ensures democratic participation and representation at the grassroots level. Direct elections are a cornerstone of the Act's design to empower local communities.


**10. With reference to the PESA Act of 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to Panchayats to scheduled areas without any modifications.
2. The Act mandates that the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats in scheduled areas should not be less than one-half of the total number of seats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PESA Act extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution to Scheduled Areas, but with specific modifications to accommodate the unique circumstances and customary practices of tribal communities.  The modifications are designed to ensure that the Panchayati Raj system respects and integrates traditional governance structures and customs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act mandates that the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats within Scheduled Areas should be at least 50% of the total number of seats. This reflects the Act's commitment to ensuring adequate representation and empowerment of tribal communities in local governance. This is a crucial provision ensuring tribal self-governance.


**11. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when requested by the President of India.
2. The UPSC's functions are primarily advisory in nature, not decision-making.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the UPSC's primary role is serving the Union Government, it can also assist state governments upon a request from the President. This reflects the UPSC's role as a central institution providing expertise and ensuring a uniform standard in recruitment and selection across the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The UPSC's mandate is to advise the government on matters related to recruitment, appointments, and other personnel matters. They provide expert recommendations, but the final decision-making authority rests with the government. This advisory role ensures objectivity and fairness in the selection process.  The UPSC's recommendations carry significant weight but are not binding.


**12. With reference to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAT was established under Article 312A of the Constitution.
2. The CAT primarily deals with service matters related to central government employees.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAT was not established under Article 312A of the Constitution.  Article 312A deals with the power of Parliament to create All-India Services. The CAT was established through an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional provision. This reflects the legislative flexibility in establishing specialized tribunals to handle specific administrative matters efficiently.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAT is a specialized tribunal established to adjudicate service-related disputes of central government employees.  This provides a quicker and more specialized mechanism for resolving such disputes compared to the traditional court system, ensuring efficient redressal of grievances.  This is a crucial aspect of administrative justice.


**13. Consider the following statements about the President's rule in a state:**

1. The President can impose President's rule in a state only if the state's Legislative Assembly is dissolved.
2. The President's rule in a state can be imposed for a maximum period of six months without any further extension.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's rule, or the imposition of Article 356, does not require the prior dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly. While dissolution may occur concurrently or subsequently, it's not a prerequisite for imposing President's rule. The power is invoked when the constitutional machinery in the state has broken down.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  President's rule can be initially imposed for a maximum of six months. However, it can be extended further by Parliament, with each extension requiring parliamentary approval.  The duration of President's rule is not fixed and depends on the prevailing circumstances and parliamentary decisions.  This reflects the checks and balances within the federal system.


**14. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  The government can accept or reject the recommendations, but it needs to provide reasons for rejecting the recommendations. This reflects the balance of power between the independent constitutional body and the government.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India constitutes the Finance Commission every five years, as mandated by the Constitution. This ensures the regular review of Centre-State financial relations and provides a mechanism for addressing evolving financial needs. The Commission's independence is vital for maintaining a fair distribution of resources.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body.
2. The NDC's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body; it is a non-statutory body established by a resolution of the government. This reflects the flexibility in creating bodies for intergovernmental coordination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NDC's recommendations are not binding on the Union and State Governments.  They serve as important guidelines for national planning and development, but the final decisions rest with the respective governments.  This reflects the principle of cooperative federalism.  The NDC serves as a forum for consultation and consensus-building.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the reservation of seats in municipal areas, consider the following statements:**

1.  SCs and STs are given reservation of seats in proportion to their population in municipal areas.
2.  One-third of the seats in municipal bodies are reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in municipal bodies in proportion to their population in the respective municipal areas. This ensures representation of these marginalized communities in local governance.  This is a crucial aspect of inclusive governance and aims to address historical injustices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 74th Amendment Act does mandate reservation of at least one-third of the total number of seats for women in municipalities, this reservation is *in addition* to the seats already reserved for SC and ST women.  The total number of reserved seats for women might exceed one-third if the number of SC/ST women candidates is significant.  Therefore, the statement that it is irrespective of the SC/ST women reservation is factually inaccurate. The aim is to ensure representation of women from all sections of society.


**2. With reference to the tenure and functioning of municipal councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The tenure of a municipal council is five years, commencing from the date of its first meeting.
2. If a municipal council is dissolved before completing its five-year term, a new council is formed for a fresh five-year term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the normal tenure of a municipal council is indeed five years, the commencement date is not necessarily the date of the first meeting.  It typically begins from the date the election results are declared. This is a crucial distinction, as the period between the declaration of results and the first meeting can be significant for the commencement of the council’s functional tenure.

Statement 2 is correct. If a municipal council is dissolved prematurely, a new council is constituted for a full five-year term. This ensures continuity in local governance and prevents prolonged periods without an elected body.  The process of reconstituting the council is governed by state laws and ensures that the democratic process is maintained. The five-year term is a constitutional mandate under the 74th Amendment Act.


**3. With reference to the Nagar Panchayat's wards committees, consider the following statements:**

1.  Wards committees are formed with some wards of the Nagar Panchayat, and councillors elected from those wards automatically become members.
2. The chairman of a wards committee is elected by the members of that committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Wards committees in Nagar Panchayats are formed by grouping together certain wards. Councillors elected from those specific wards are automatically members of the corresponding wards committee. This ensures local representation and participation in decision-making processes at the ward level. This is a key feature of decentralized governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The chairman of a wards committee is not necessarily elected by the members of the committee itself. The method of selecting or appointing the chairman varies across states, and it may be nominated by the President of the Nagar Panchayat or selected through another mechanism prescribed by state laws.  This aspect is not uniformly defined across all Nagar Panchayats in India.


**4. With reference to the alteration in the limits of Block and Zila Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The state legislature holds the primary authority to make changes to the boundaries of Block and Zila Panchayats.
2.  Any alteration in the limits of Block and Zila Panchayats requires the prior approval of the State Election Commission.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The state legislature, being the supreme legislative body of the state, holds the power to define and alter the geographical boundaries of administrative units such as Block and Zila Panchayats.  This is a crucial aspect of administrative restructuring and reflects the legislative body's power over the organization of local governance.  Amendments to state laws govern these changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the State Election Commission plays a vital role in the conduct of Panchayat elections, it does not have the authority to approve alterations in the boundaries of Block and Zila Panchayats.  Such alterations are purely a legislative matter, handled by the state legislature through amendments to relevant acts.  The Election Commission's role comes into play only after the boundaries are legally redefined.


**5. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to those of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Indian federal system, with the President at the apex of the executive branch.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor does have significant executive, legislative, and some quasi-judicial powers in the state, these are not analogous to the President's powers in the same way. The President's powers are far more extensive and encompass the entire nation, while the Governor's powers are limited to the state.  The Governor's powers are also subject to the advice of the state's Council of Ministers.


**6. With reference to the Chief Minister's tenure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chief Minister holds office during the pleasure of the Governor.
2.  The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chief Minister holds office during the pleasure of the Governor. This means the Governor can dismiss the Chief Minister at any time, though this power is largely exercised only when the Chief Minister loses the confidence of the state legislative assembly.  This provision reflects the constitutional framework of the state executive.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.  However, the Governor is constitutionally bound to appoint the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the state legislative assembly. This provision ensures that the executive branch reflects the will of the elected legislature.


**7. With reference to the functions of the Estimates Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to enhance efficiency and economy in administration.
2. The Estimates Committee examines whether the money allocated is spent within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Estimates Committee of the Parliament plays a vital role in scrutinizing government expenditure.  A key function is to suggest alternative policies and methods to improve efficiency and economy in government operations. This involves analyzing existing policies and proposing improvements to reduce waste and optimize resource allocation.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major responsibility of the Estimates Committee is to examine whether the funds allocated to various government departments and schemes are being utilized effectively and within the parameters of the approved policies.  This ensures that public money is spent judiciously and achieves the intended objectives.  The Committee's scrutiny promotes accountability and transparency.


**8. With reference to the CAG's responsibilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is responsible only to the Parliament and certifies the net proceeds of any tax.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible only to the Parliament.  A key function is to certify the net proceeds of taxes collected by the Union and the states.  This ensures accuracy and transparency in tax revenue accounting. The CAG's independence is crucial for maintaining financial accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and state governments, it does not compile and maintain these accounts. The respective governments maintain their own accounts, and the CAG's role is to audit them for accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.  The CAG's audit reports are then submitted to the Parliament and state legislatures for scrutiny.


**9. With reference to the Balwantray Mehta Committee's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Balwantray Mehta Committee recommended that the District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zila Parishad.
2. The Balwantray Mehta Committee recommended genuine transfer of power and responsibility to the Panchayati Raj institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key recommendation of the Balwantray Mehta Committee was that the District Collector should chair the Zila Parishad. This was intended to ensure effective coordination between the administrative and the newly established Panchayati Raj institutions.  However, this recommendation has been subject to debate and modification over time.

Statement 2 is correct. A central theme of the Balwantray Mehta Committee's report was the need for a genuine devolution of power and responsibility to Panchayati Raj institutions. This aimed to empower local communities and enhance their participation in development planning and implementation.  This recommendation formed the foundation for the subsequent constitutional amendments related to Panchayati Raj.


**10. With reference to the Lokpal Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. The first Lokpal Bill was introduced in the Parliament in 1968.
2. The Lokpal is a constitutional body established to investigate allegations of corruption against public officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first Lokpal Bill was introduced in the Parliament not in 1968, but in 1967. While there were several subsequent attempts to introduce and pass the Lokpal Bill, the first attempt was made in 1967.  This highlights the long-standing debate and challenges in establishing an effective anti-corruption mechanism in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lokpal is not a constitutional body.  It was established by an Act of Parliament, not through a constitutional amendment.  This reflects the legislative process for creating such institutions, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  The Lokpal's powers and jurisdiction are defined by the Act establishing it.


**11. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is an organ of the Planning Commission.
2. Economic and social planning is a subject included in the Concurrent List of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not an organ of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission was abolished in 2014 and replaced by the NITI Aayog.  The NDC continues to function as a forum for cooperative federalism, involving the central government and state governments in planning and policy formulation.

Statement 2 is correct. Economic and social planning is a subject included in the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution.  This means both the Union and state governments can make laws on this subject.  This reflects the federal structure of India, where both levels of government have a role in economic and social development.


**12. With reference to the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Secretariat prepares the agenda for Cabinet meetings and provides secretarial assistance to Cabinet Committees.
2. The Cabinet Secretariat allocates financial resources to the various ministries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cabinet Secretariat plays a crucial role in supporting the functioning of the Union Cabinet.  Its key functions include preparing the agenda for Cabinet meetings, ensuring smooth conduct of meetings, and providing secretarial assistance to various Cabinet Committees. This ensures the efficient functioning of the highest decision-making body of the executive branch.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretariat does not allocate financial resources to the ministries.  The allocation of financial resources is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.  The Cabinet Secretariat's role is primarily administrative and supportive, focusing on facilitating the decision-making process of the Cabinet.


**13. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of only the central government.
2. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then places them before Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's responsibilities extend beyond auditing the accounts of the central government.  The CAG also audits the accounts of state governments, as well as autonomous bodies and public sector undertakings. This ensures comprehensive financial oversight across the government's various entities.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then lays them before both houses of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary scrutiny of government finances and promotes accountability and transparency.  This is a key aspect of parliamentary control over the executive.


**14. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has members representing the Union Territories.
2. The nominated members of the Rajya Sabha do not have the right to vote in the election of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have members directly representing the Union Territories.  Representation in the Rajya Sabha is based on states, with each state having a certain number of representatives based on its population.  The Union Territories have no direct representation in the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the Rajya Sabha has nominated members, these members do not have voting rights in the election of the President.  This is a specific provision of the Constitution, which restricts the voting rights in presidential elections to only elected members of Parliament and state legislative assemblies.


**15. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a money bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a money bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the principle of financial accountability, with the lower house having primary control over financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and suggesting amendments, but it cannot originate a money bill.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a money bill, it can suggest amendments to a money bill.  However, the Lok Sabha has the ultimate authority to accept or reject these amendments.  This reflects the balance of power between the two houses in financial matters.


**16. With reference to the Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1. Union Territories are not represented in the Rajya Sabha.
2. The legislative powers of the Union Territories are vested in the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Union Territories do not have direct representation in the Rajya Sabha.  Representation in the Rajya Sabha is based on states, with each state having a certain number of representatives based on its population. The Union Territories have no direct representation in the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  The legislative powers of Union Territories are vested in the Parliament.  This is a key aspect of the constitutional framework, reflecting the central government's authority over these territories.  The Parliament can enact laws for Union Territories, while state legislatures have no such power over them.


**17. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA's objective is to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society.
2. NALSA issues guidelines for the State Legal Services Authorities to implement legal programs throughout the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) is a statutory body established to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society.  This is a crucial aspect of ensuring access to justice for all, irrespective of socioeconomic status.  NALSA works to bridge the gap between the law and the marginalized.

Statement 2 is correct. NALSA plays a pivotal role in coordinating and supervising the functioning of the State Legal Services Authorities (SLSA).  It issues guidelines and directions to the SLSAs to ensure uniform implementation of legal aid programs and schemes across the country.  This promotes consistency and effectiveness in the delivery of legal services.


**18. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Forest Department initiates the process for determining individual or community forest rights.
2. The Gram Sabha is the authority to initiate the process for determining the nature and extent of individual or community forest rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, explicitly designates the Gram Sabha as the primary authority to initiate the process for determining the nature and extent of individual or community forest rights. This reflects the importance of community participation in forest resource management.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha, as the local self-governance body, plays a central role in identifying and recognizing forest rights under the Act.  This is a crucial aspect of ensuring that the rights of traditional forest dwellers are protected and respected.  The Gram Sabha's role is crucial for participatory governance in forest areas.


**19. With reference to "Economic Justice" as an objective of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. "Economic Justice" is mentioned only in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. "Economic Justice" is reflected in both the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While "Economic Justice" is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble, its principles and implications are not limited to the Preamble alone.  The concept is further elaborated and implemented through provisions in other parts of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The concept of "Economic Justice" is reflected in both the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy.  While the Fundamental Rights primarily focus on individual liberties, the Directive Principles aim to establish social and economic justice through state action.  The combined effect of both sections aims to establish a just and equitable society.


**20. With reference to the consequences of a Money Bill being substantially amended by the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha may still proceed with the Bill, accepting or rejecting the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Lok Sabha must send the Bill back to the Rajya Sabha for reconsideration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. If the Rajya Sabha amends a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha can still proceed with the Bill, either accepting or rejecting the amendments suggested by the Rajya Sabha.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills, reflecting its primary role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is to suggest amendments, but it cannot veto a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha is not constitutionally obligated to send a Money Bill back to the Rajya Sabha for reconsideration after it has been amended. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject the amendments, and its decision is final.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters.


**21. With reference to the appointment of Governors, consider the following statements:**

1. The same person cannot be appointed as Governor for two or more states simultaneously.
2.  The procedure for the removal of a Governor from office is laid down in the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The same person can be appointed as Governor for two or more states simultaneously. This is a common practice in India to optimize the utilization of experienced individuals in gubernatorial positions.  This is permitted under the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does not lay down a specific procedure for the removal of a Governor. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss the Governor at any time without following a prescribed procedure.  This reflects the President's ultimate authority over the executive branch.


**22. With reference to the election of members of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. The members of the Constituent Assembly from the provinces were directly elected by the people of those provinces.
2. The members of the Constituent Assembly were selected by the Government for their expertise in constitutional matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Members of the Constituent Assembly from the provinces were not directly elected by the people.  They were elected indirectly by the provincial legislatures.  This reflects the political context of the time and the existing system of representation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some members of the Constituent Assembly were chosen for their expertise in constitutional matters, this was not the sole criterion.  Many members were elected representatives from various political parties and regions.  The composition aimed to represent a wide range of perspectives.


**23. With reference to the amendment of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. An amendment to the Constitution can be initiated only by introducing a bill in the Lok Sabha.
2. An amendment seeking to change the federal character of the Constitution requires ratification by the legislatures of all the states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The process of amending the Constitution begins with the introduction of a bill in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  While both houses have a role in the amendment process, the initiation can be from either house.  This reflects the balance of power between the two houses of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An amendment seeking to alter the federal character of the Constitution does not necessarily require ratification by the legislatures of all states.  The specific requirements for ratification vary depending on the nature of the amendment.  Some amendments may require ratification by a specified number of state legislatures, while others may not require any state-level ratification.


**24. With reference to the Attorney General of India's participation in Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
2. The Attorney General can vote in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India can participate in the proceedings of both houses of Parliament.  This allows them to offer legal advice and opinions on matters before Parliament, contributing to informed decision-making.  This is a key aspect of their role as the government's chief legal advisor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General cannot vote in either house of Parliament.  They are not members of Parliament, and their role is advisory, not legislative.  This reflects the distinction between the executive and legislative branches of government.


**25. With reference to bodies mentioned in the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is mentioned in the Constitution.
2. The Planning Commission is mentioned in the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not mentioned in the Constitution.  It is a non-constitutional body established by a resolution of the government.  This reflects the flexibility in creating bodies to support policy-making outside the strict framework of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Planning Commission was also not mentioned in the Constitution. It was a non-constitutional body established by a resolution of the government.  It was later abolished and replaced by NITI Aayog.  This demonstrates the dynamic nature of policy-making structures outside the constitutional framework.


**26. With reference to the Parliament's power to make laws implementing international treaties, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament needs the consent of all the states to make laws implementing international treaties.
2. The Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India for implementing international treaties without the consent of any state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament does not require the consent of all states to make laws implementing international treaties.  The Parliament's power to make laws on matters related to international relations is supreme, reflecting India's sovereignty in foreign affairs.  State-level consent is not a constitutional requirement in this matter.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Parliament has the power to make laws for the whole or any part of India to implement international treaties without the consent of any state.  This is a crucial aspect of India's ability to fulfill its international obligations and participate in global affairs.


**27. With reference to the objectives of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. One objective of the PESA Act is to create autonomous regions in tribal areas.
2. One objective of the PESA Act is to free tribal people from exploitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PESA Act does not aim to create autonomous regions in tribal areas.  While it empowers Gram Sabhas and enhances self-governance, it does not establish separate autonomous regions. The Act focuses on strengthening existing governance structures within the existing administrative framework.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of the PESA Act is to protect the interests of tribal people and free them from exploitation.  The Act aims to ensure their participation in decision-making processes related to their land and resources, thereby promoting their well-being and preventing exploitation. This is a crucial aspect of social justice and empowerment of marginalized communities.


**28. With reference to the declaration of "Classical Languages", consider the following statements:**

1. Kannada and Telugu have been declared as Classical Languages.
2. Gujarati has not been declared as a Classical Language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Kannada and Telugu are among the languages that have been declared as "Classical Languages" by the Government of India.  This recognition acknowledges their rich literary heritage and cultural significance.  The declaration also comes with certain benefits and support for the development and promotion of these languages.

Statement 2 is correct. Gujarati is not currently among the languages that have been declared as "Classical Languages". The criteria for declaring a language as "Classical" are rigorous, requiring a long and unbroken literary tradition.  While Gujarati has a rich literary tradition, it has not yet met all the criteria for this particular designation.

1. Sales tax on toothpaste is imposed by the Central Government.
2. Sales tax on goods is imposed and collected by the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sales tax on goods like toothpaste is not imposed by the Central Government.  The power to impose sales tax on goods is primarily vested in the State Governments. This is a key aspect of the division of powers between the Union and the states.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sales tax on goods is imposed and collected by the State Governments.  This is a significant source of revenue for the states, and the rates and structure of the sales tax are determined by state-level legislation. This is a key element of state-level fiscal autonomy.


**30. With reference to the anti-defection law, consider the following statements:**

1. The provisions regarding anti-defection are contained in the Second Schedule of the Constitution.
2. The anti-defection law is contained in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provisions relating to anti-defection are not found in the Second Schedule of the Constitution. The Second Schedule deals with emoluments, allowances, and privileges of certain dignitaries.  The anti-defection law is a separate addition to the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The anti-defection law is contained in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.  This schedule lays down the provisions for disqualification of members of Parliament and state legislatures on the grounds of defection from one party to another. This is a crucial provision to maintain stability in the political system.

1. The promotion of international peace and security is included in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. The promotion of international peace and security is included in the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The promotion of international peace and security is not explicitly mentioned in the Preamble. While the Preamble aims for a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic ensuring justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, it doesn't specifically mention international peace and security.

Statement 2 is correct. The promotion of international peace and security is included among the Fundamental Duties of citizens as enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution.  This reflects the importance of global harmony and India's commitment to peaceful international relations.  It is part of the civic responsibilities of citizens.


**32. With reference to the "Right to Privacy", consider the following statements:**

1. The "Right to Privacy" is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the "Right to Privacy" as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Right to Privacy" is not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original text of the Constitution.  The recognition of this right has evolved through judicial interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court of India has recognized the "Right to Privacy" as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.  This judicial interpretation has significantly impacted the scope of Fundamental Rights in India.  This highlights the evolving nature of constitutional rights through judicial pronouncements.


**33.  With reference to the Aadhaar card, consider the following statements:**

1. An Aadhaar card can be used as proof of citizenship or domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or omitted by the issuing authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Aadhaar card is primarily a unique identification number and not proof of citizenship or domicile.  While it can be used as proof of identity for various purposes

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in municipal areas is mandated to be in proportion to their population relative to the total population.
2.  Periodic elections for municipalities must be held every five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect provisions related to municipal governance in India.  The Constitution and subsequent legislation mandate reservations for SCs and STs in proportion to their population in municipal bodies to ensure their representation. This is a crucial aspect of social justice and affirmative action in India's urban governance.  Similarly, the periodic holding of elections every five years is a cornerstone of democratic governance, ensuring accountability and the renewal of representation within municipal councils.  Failure to conduct elections within the stipulated timeframe can lead to legal challenges and administrative issues.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the validity of either one or both of the statements, which are both factually accurate reflections of established legal provisions.


**2. With reference to the functioning of Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  Panchayats have the power to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, etc., but this power is subject to state legislative limitations.
2.  A person must be at least 21 years old to be eligible for membership in a Panchayat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Panchayats are granted significant financial autonomy by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, allowing them to levy and collect various taxes and duties. However, the extent of this power is subject to the overarching legislative authority of the state government. State laws define the specific taxes Panchayats can levy and the limits on their tax collection powers.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The minimum age for contesting Panchayat elections is 21 years, as per the 73rd Amendment Act. However, this is the minimum age for contesting, not necessarily for being a member.  A person younger than 21 could be a member if elected before the age of 21. The options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the nuanced reality of Panchayat financial autonomy and membership eligibility.


**3. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Acts make it mandatory for all states to establish a three-tier system of local government.
2.  The Acts mandate a five-year term for directly elected representatives in Panchayats and Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Amendments aim to establish a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj and urban local bodies, respectively, they do not *mandate* it for all states. The implementation is left to the discretion of individual state governments, considering their specific needs and contexts. Some states may have different structures due to their unique geographical or demographic characteristics. Statement 2 is correct. The Acts stipulate a five-year term for directly elected members in Panchayats and Municipalities, ensuring a stable period of governance and a regular process of democratic renewal.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the mandatory and discretionary aspects of the 73rd and 74th Amendments’ implementation.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Nagar Panchayats:**

1.  Nagar Panchayats are constituted for smaller urban areas to provide basic civic amenities and governance.
2.  The procedure for maintaining accounts and auditing Nagar Panchayats is decided by the State Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nagar Panchayats are established in India to cater to the administrative and developmental needs of smaller urban areas that don't meet the criteria for larger municipal corporations or municipalities. They provide essential services and governance structures suitable for their scale. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the State Governor holds significant power within a state, the specifics of accounting and auditing procedures for Nagar Panchayats are typically determined by state legislation, not directly by the Governor. State legislature enact laws outlining these procedures, often guided by broader national accounting standards. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the role of Nagar Panchayats and the authority responsible for determining their accounting and auditing procedures.


**5. Consider the following statements about the 11th Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The 11th Schedule distributes powers between State Legislatures and Panchayats.
2.  The 11th Schedule outlines 29 functional items that fall under the purview of Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The 11th Schedule, added by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, is specifically designed to delineate the functional areas of Panchayats. It devolves significant powers and responsibilities to these local governing bodies, fostering decentralized governance.  The 29 functional items listed in the 11th Schedule cover a wide range of areas, including agriculture, rural development, education, and health, highlighting the comprehensive role of Panchayats in rural India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the dual role of the 11th Schedule in both power distribution and functional specification.


**6. With reference to the tenure of elected members of Autonomous District Councils, consider the following statements:**

1.  Their tenure is five years from the date of their election.
2.  The term is five years from the date of the first meeting of the council after the election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The tenure of elected members in Autonomous District Councils is not simply five years from the date of election.  The precise starting point is the date of the first meeting of the council following the election, allowing for the necessary organizational and administrative procedures to be finalized. Statement 2 is correct. The five-year term begins from the date the council formally commences its operations after the election, ensuring a clear and legally defined commencement of their responsibilities. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the precise starting point of the tenure for members of Autonomous District Councils.


**7. With reference to the powers of State Legislatures, consider the following statements:**

1.  State Legislatures have the power to make laws on all matters relating to Panchayat elections.
2.  The State Election Commissioner is appointed by the Chief Election Commissioner of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act vests the power to legislate on all matters related to Panchayat elections with the State Legislatures. This ensures that the electoral framework aligns with the specific needs and circumstances of each state. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The State Election Commissioner is appointed by the Governor of the respective state, not by the Chief Election Commissioner of India.  This reflects the decentralized nature of state-level election management.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the authority responsible for appointing the State Election Commissioner and the legislative power over Panchayat elections.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Chief Minister's tenure:**

1.  The Chief Minister holds office until the pleasure of the Governor.
2.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The Chief Minister's tenure is contingent upon the Governor's pleasure, meaning the Governor can dismiss the Chief Minister at any time.  This is a constitutional provision reflecting the Governor's role as the nominal head of the state.  The Governor also appoints the Chief Minister, typically the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislative assembly.  However, this is a largely formal act, as the Governor is bound by constitutional convention to appoint the leader of the majority party. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the intertwined nature of the Governor's power and the Chief Minister's dependence on the Governor's pleasure.


**9. With reference to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates the organization of Gram Sabhas in villages or groups of villages.
2.  The Act provides for the reservation of one-third of the total number of seats for women in Panchayats at all levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of the provisions of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.  The Act mandates the constitution of Gram Sabhas, the village-level assemblies, as the cornerstone of grassroot democracy.  This empowers villagers to participate directly in local governance and decision-making. The Act also mandates the reservation of at least one-third of the seats in Panchayats at all levels for women, promoting gender equality in local governance. This is a key aspect of social justice and empowerment. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual significance of Gram Sabhas and women's reservation as mandated provisions under the 73rd Amendment.


**10. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to the President.
2. The Governor always acts with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor holds significant executive, legislative, and some quasi-judicial powers, these are not analogous to the President's powers in the same way.  The President's powers are significantly broader, especially in matters of national importance.  The Governor's powers are primarily confined to the state level. Statement 2 is largely correct.  The Governor is constitutionally bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers in most matters, reflecting the parliamentary system of government at the state level.  However, there are certain discretionary powers vested with the Governor in specific situations as outlined in the Constitution. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either overstate the Governor's powers or misrepresent the relationship between the Governor and the Council of Ministers.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):**

1. The CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  Their primary accountability is to the Parliament, ensuring that public funds are used efficiently and transparently. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAG audits the accounts of state governments, they do not compile and maintain these accounts.  State governments have their own accounting systems, and the CAG audits those systems to ensure accuracy and compliance with financial regulations. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the CAG's role in relation to state government accounts and their primary accountability.


**12. With reference to the  differences between a censure motion and a no-confidence motion, consider the following statements:**

1. A no-confidence motion can be moved only against the Council of Ministers, while a censure motion can be moved against individual ministers or groups of ministers.
2. The government must resign if a no-confidence motion is passed, but it need not resign if a censure motion is passed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly highlight key differences between censure and no-confidence motions. A no-confidence motion directly challenges the government's ability to govern, targeting the entire Council of Ministers.  A censure motion, on the other hand, expresses disapproval of specific actions or policies of the government, possibly targeting individual ministers or a subset of the council.  A successful no-confidence motion necessitates the resignation of the government, while a censure motion, even if passed, does not automatically trigger the government's resignation. The censure motion serves as a symbolic expression of disapproval, potentially influencing future government actions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize these crucial distinctions between the two types of motions.


**13. Consider the following statements about the  Estimates Committee:**

1. The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to improve administrative efficiency and economy.
2. The Estimates Committee examines whether the money allocated is spent within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe functions of the Estimates Committee, a crucial parliamentary committee in India.  The committee scrutinizes government expenditure and evaluates the efficiency and economy of government programs.  It identifies areas of potential waste or inefficiency and suggests alternative policies or approaches to improve resource allocation and administrative effectiveness. The committee's role is not merely to review existing spending but also to proactively suggest ways to enhance government performance and ensure better value for money. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the broad scope of the Estimates Committee's functions in both policy evaluation and financial scrutiny.


**14. With reference to the recommendations of the Balwantray Mehta Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended that the District Collector should be the chairman of the Zila Parishad.
2. The committee advocated for genuine transfer of power and responsibility to Panchayati Raj institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Balwantray Mehta Committee did *not* recommend that the District Collector should be the chairman of the Zila Parishad.  The committee's vision was to empower locally elected representatives, and placing an official like the District Collector in such a position would have undermined this goal. Statement 2 is correct.  A central theme of the Balwantray Mehta Committee's report was the genuine devolution of power and responsibility to Panchayati Raj institutions.  The committee aimed to create truly democratic and participatory local governance structures. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the Committee's recommendations regarding the leadership of the Zila Parishad.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Lokpal Bill:**

1. The first Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1971.
2. The Lokpal's primary function is to investigate complaints of corruption against public officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lokpal concept has a long history in India, the precise year of introduction of the first Lokpal Bill is subject to debate and varies depending on the specific definition of "Lokpal Bill".  There were several attempts to introduce such legislation before 1971.  Statement 2 is correct. The Lokpal, once established, is intended to be an independent anti-corruption body with the power to investigate complaints of corruption against public officials, including ministers and other high-ranking government functionaries.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the historical timeline of Lokpal Bill introductions and the Lokpal's primary function.


**16. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC was set up by a constitutional provision.
2. The CVC's functions are primarily advisory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CVC was not established through a constitutional provision; it's a statutory body created by an executive resolution of the Government of India.  This reflects the government's initiative in establishing a mechanism to combat corruption. Statement 2 is correct.  The CVC's powers are largely advisory, meaning it recommends actions to other government agencies. It doesn't have the power to directly punish or prosecute individuals.  Its effectiveness depends heavily on the cooperation of other government bodies. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the legal basis of the CVC's establishment and the nature of its functions.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the  Parliamentary Committee on Government Assurances:**

1. The committee examines whether promises made by ministers on the floor of the House have been fulfilled.
2. The committee has the power to summon and examine witnesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the functions and powers of the Committee on Government Assurances. The committee is responsible for monitoring the implementation of assurances given by ministers to Parliament. This ensures government accountability and helps track progress on policy commitments. The committee has the power to call witnesses, gather information, and examine evidence to assess the fulfillment of these assurances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to fully capture the committee's monitoring and investigative functions.


**18. With reference to the  Public Accounts Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's report on appropriation accounts.
2. The Public Accounts Committee consists of members from both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Public Accounts Committee's composition and functions. The committee's primary responsibility is to scrutinize government expenditure and ensure that public funds are used effectively and transparently. It examines the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) reports on appropriation accounts, ensuring that funds are used for the purposes approved by Parliament. The committee's membership comprises members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, ensuring representation from both houses of Parliament. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge both the CAG report examination and the bicameral nature of the committee's membership.


**19.  Consider the following statements regarding the  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when requested by the President.
2. The UPSC advises the President on matters related to the reservation of posts for Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the UPSC's primary function is to serve the Union Government, it can extend its services to states under specific circumstances, primarily when requested by the President. This typically involves matters related to recruitment and appointments to state services. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UPSC's advisory role does not extend to decisions on reservations.  The government's policy on reservations for Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes is determined by the government and implemented through legislation, not by the UPSC. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the UPSC's role in serving state governments and its involvement in reservation policies.


**20. With reference to the  adjournment motion, consider the following statements:**

1. An adjournment motion seeks to interrupt the normal business of the Assembly to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.
2. An adjournment motion can be moved only in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An adjournment motion is a parliamentary procedure used to suspend the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of immediate public importance.  The motion requires the support of a significant number of members and is usually related to urgent issues requiring immediate attention. Statement 2 is incorrect. Adjournment motions are not restricted to the Lok Sabha; they can be moved in both Houses of Parliament, although with varying procedural rules. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the purpose and scope of the adjournment motion.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding the  President's rule:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The proclamation of President's rule suspends Article 19 in the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule (Article 356) does not automatically dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.  While it is often accompanied by the dissolution of the assembly, the President can choose not to dissolve it, depending on the circumstances.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's rule does not automatically suspend Article 19 (relating to fundamental rights). Article 19's suspension is a separate process that requires a separate order. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the consequences of the imposition of President's rule.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the  election of the President of India:**

1. The value of each MLA's vote varies from state to state.
2. The value of the vote of Lok Sabha MPs is more than that of Rajya Sabha MPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The value of each MLA's vote in the presidential election is determined by a formula that takes into account the state's population and the number of MLAs.  Therefore, the value of an MLA's vote differs from state to state. Statement 2 is incorrect. The value of a vote of an MP from the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha is the same in the presidential election. The formula for determining the value of votes of MPs and MLAs is the same for both houses. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the formula used to calculate the value of votes in the presidential election.


**23. With reference to the  features of Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. Indian federalism is the result of an agreement among the federating units.
2. The federating units have been given unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Indian federalism is not the result of an agreement among the federating units in the same way as some other federations.  It evolved through a complex historical process, with significant input from the British government, and was not a purely negotiated agreement between equal units.  Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, provides unequal representation to the states, with larger states having more representatives than smaller states.  This reflects a compromise between strict equality and the need to balance population size and state representation. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the historical evolution of Indian federalism and the nature of representation in the Rajya Sabha.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding  local self-government:**

1. Local self-government is best explained as an exercise in democratic decentralization.
2. Local self-government involves the administrative delegation of some powers to local bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer valid perspectives on local self-government.  Local self-government is fundamentally an exercise in democratic decentralization, bringing governance closer to the people and empowering them to participate directly in decision-making processes.  It also involves the administrative delegation of certain powers and responsibilities from higher levels of government to local bodies. This delegation allows local bodies to manage their affairs with greater autonomy. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to consider the dual aspects of democratic participation and administrative delegation in local governance.


**25. With reference to the  parliamentary control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers through the question hour.
2. Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers through adjournment motions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify mechanisms through which Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers.  The question hour allows members of Parliament to seek clarifications and accountability from ministers on various aspects of government policies and actions.  This is a vital tool for oversight and scrutiny.  Adjournment motions, while less frequently used, provide a mechanism for the House to express its disapproval of government actions and to demand immediate attention to urgent matters.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize both the question hour and adjournment motions as tools of parliamentary control.


**26. With reference to the  Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is a bill presented by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the government.
2. Recently, a private member's bill has been passed in the Parliament of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister or a member of the ruling party.  These bills often address issues not prioritized by the government. Statement 2 is factually debatable. While private member's bills are introduced, their passage into law is rare due to the limited time allocated and the government's legislative priorities.  The statement lacks sufficient clarity to be deemed definitively correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either misrepresent the definition of a private member's bill or make an unsubstantiated claim about their recent passage.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the  parliamentary form of government:**

1. In a parliamentary system, the executive and legislature work independently.
2. In a parliamentary system, the executive remains responsible to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A defining feature of a parliamentary system is the close relationship between the executive and legislature.  The executive branch is drawn from and accountable to the legislature. This ensures a degree of mutual influence and interdependence. Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental principle of a parliamentary system is that the executive (the government) is responsible to the legislature (the Parliament). This accountability is ensured through mechanisms like the question hour, no-confidence motions, and debates. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental relationship between the executive and legislature in a parliamentary system.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the  Cabinet form of government:**

1. The Cabinet form of government is a mechanism for speeding up governmental activities.
2. The Cabinet form of government ensures collective responsibility of the government to the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Cabinet form of government. The Cabinet system, with its collective decision-making process, can streamline governmental action by facilitating quicker consensus and coordinated policy implementation.  It brings together key ministers to discuss and decide on policies, leading to more efficient governance.  The system also embodies the principle of collective responsibility, where the entire Cabinet is accountable to the legislature and the people for its actions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize both the efficiency and accountability aspects of the Cabinet form of government.


**29. With reference to  judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review implies the power of the judiciary to pronounce on the constitutionality of laws.
2. Judicial review implies the power of the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Judicial review is a cornerstone of India's constitutional framework, granting the judiciary the power to determine the constitutionality of laws passed by the legislature or executive orders issued by the government.  If a law is found to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the court can declare it invalid. Statement 2 is incorrect. Judicial review is not about questioning the wisdom or policy choices behind a law; it's about ensuring that the law conforms to the Constitution's provisions.  The judiciary's role is to interpret the Constitution, not to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature on policy matters. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope and limits of judicial review in India.


**30. Consider the following statements regarding  the relationship between law and liberty:**

1.  If there are more laws, there is less liberty.
2. If there is liberty, laws have to be made by the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification.  The relationship between law and liberty is not simply inverse; more laws do not automatically mean less liberty.  Well-crafted laws can protect and enhance liberty by establishing a framework of rights and responsibilities. Conversely, the absence of law can lead to chaos and the suppression of individual freedoms. Statement 2 is a more accurate reflection of the ideal relationship between law and liberty in a democratic society.  A fundamental principle of democracy is that laws should be made by, or at least with the consent of, the people they govern. This ensures that laws reflect the will of the people and protect their liberties. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they present an incomplete or inaccurate view of the complex relationship between law and liberty.


**31. Consider the following statements regarding  the "Rule of Law":**

1. The Rule of Law implies limitation of powers.
2. The Rule of Law implies people's responsibility to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core principle of the Rule of Law is that all individuals and institutions, including the government, are subject to and accountable under the law.  This implies the limitation of arbitrary power and the protection of individual rights. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While citizens have responsibilities towards the government (like paying taxes and obeying laws), the Rule of Law primarily emphasizes the government's responsibility to uphold the law and respect individual rights.  It is not about the people's responsibility to the government in the same sense. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the core principles of the Rule of Law.


**32. With reference to the  Right to Education (RTE) Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTE Act requires a person to possess the minimum qualification laid down by the concerned State Council of Teacher Education to be eligible for appointment as a teacher.
2. The RTE Act requires candidates for teaching primary classes to pass a Teacher Eligibility Test.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect provisions of the RTE Act. The Act sets minimum qualification standards for teachers, often incorporating the guidelines of State Councils of Teacher Education.  This ensures a minimum level of competency among teachers.  The Act also mandates the passing of a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) for teachers in primary classes, ensuring a standardized assessment of teaching aptitude and skills. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize both the minimum qualification and TET requirements under the RTE Act.


**33. With reference to the  National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT has been established by an Act of Parliament, while the CPCB has been created by an executive order.
2. The NGT primarily aims to provide environmental

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the provisions related to SCs and STs in municipal areas:**

1.  Seats are reserved for SCs and STs in proportion to their population in the total municipal population.
2.  A minimum of one-third of the total seats are mandatorily reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The target content explicitly mentions the reservation of seats for SCs and STs in municipal areas in proportion to their population. This reflects the constitutional commitment to ensuring representation for marginalized communities in local governance.  The principle of proportional representation aims to address historical injustices and ensure equitable participation in decision-making processes.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text clearly states that one-third of the seats are reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats already reserved for SC and ST women. This provision underscores the importance of gender equality in local governance.  It is designed to enhance women's participation and leadership in municipal bodies, thereby promoting inclusivity and diverse perspectives in policy formulation and implementation. The fact that this reservation is in addition to the reservations for SC and ST women highlights the layered approach to affirmative action in Indian governance.  The cumulative effect of these provisions seeks to create a more representative and accountable municipal system.


**2. With reference to the mandatory provisions related to urban local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Periodic elections must be held every five years.
2. The procedure for maintaining accounts and conducting audits is determined by the state governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The target content explicitly states that periodic elections are mandatory every five years for urban local bodies.  This provision is crucial for maintaining democratic accountability and ensuring regular renewal of representation. Regular elections are a cornerstone of democratic governance, ensuring that elected officials remain responsive to the needs and aspirations of the electorate.  The five-year cycle provides a structured framework for assessing performance and facilitating change based on electoral mandates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the procedure for maintaining accounts and conducting audits *would be* decided by the State Governor, this is presented as a proposal or a potential mechanism, not a mandatory constitutional or statutory requirement.  The actual mechanism for accounting and auditing procedures in urban local bodies is subject to various laws and regulations and might vary across states.  Attributing the final decision-making power solely to the governor is an oversimplification. The governance framework for urban local bodies is complex and involves multiple stakeholders and levels of authority.


**3. With reference to the composition of urban local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nagar Panchayats are established for smaller urban areas.
2.  The constitution of Nagar Panchayats is mandated by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The target content explicitly mentions the constitution of Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas. This reflects a tiered approach to urban governance, catering to the specific needs and scales of different urban settlements.  Nagar Panchayats serve as a crucial link between rural and larger urban areas, facilitating the transition and managing the growth of smaller towns and settlements.  They play a significant role in providing basic amenities and infrastructure in these areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the central government plays a role in guiding and overseeing urban development policies, the establishment of Nagar Panchayats is primarily the responsibility of state governments. The constitutional framework allows states to create and manage their own urban local bodies, adapted to their specific contexts and needs. This reflects the federal structure of Indian governance, devolving significant administrative powers to the states.  The central government's role is largely regulatory and supportive, rather than directly dictatorial in the creation of Nagar Panchayats.


**4. Consider the following statements about the office of the Chief Minister:**

1. The Chief Minister holds office at the pleasure of the Governor.
2. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The assertion that the Chief Minister holds office at the pleasure of the Governor is accurate. This reflects the constitutional relationship between the Governor (the nominal head of the state) and the Chief Minister (the head of the state government). While the Governor has the power to dismiss the Chief Minister, this power is generally exercised only in exceptional circumstances, such as a loss of confidence in the legislative assembly or gross misconduct. The "pleasure" clause is a constitutional safeguard that ensures the stability of the government and prevents arbitrary dismissal.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.  However, this appointment is typically made after consulting with the party or coalition that commands a majority in the state legislative assembly. The Governor's role is largely formal in this instance; they are expected to appoint the leader of the majority party or coalition as the Chief Minister. This process reflects the principle of parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to the legislature. The Governor's role is primarily to ensure that the government formation process adheres to constitutional norms and principles.


**5. With reference to Lord Ripon’s Resolution of 1882, consider the following statements:**

1.  The resolution was considered a significant milestone in the development of local self-government in India.
2.  Lord Ripon is widely regarded as the "father of local self-government in India."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Ripon's Resolution of 1882 is widely acknowledged as a landmark event in the history of local self-government in India. It significantly expanded the scope and powers of local bodies, promoting decentralized governance and greater participation of Indians in administrative matters. The resolution aimed to improve local administration, enhance efficiency, and foster a sense of local responsibility and ownership.  It laid the foundation for the subsequent development of local self-government institutions, though their progress was often hampered by colonial constraints.

Statement 2 is also correct. Lord Ripon is often referred to as the "father of local self-government in India" due to his significant contributions to the development of local bodies. His resolution of 1882 is considered a watershed moment, marking a crucial step towards empowering local communities and introducing elements of self-governance within the colonial framework.  His efforts to decentralize administrative authority and increase Indian participation in local governance laid the groundwork for the later constitutional provisions related to Panchayati Raj and municipal bodies. While the implementation of his vision faced challenges, his legacy remains significant in the evolution of local governance in India.


**6. With reference to the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment grants constitutional status to the Gram Sabha.
2. The Balwantray Mehta Committee report was instrumental in the conceptualization of the Gram Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 explicitly grants constitutional status to the Gram Sabha.  This provision is a crucial aspect of the Panchayati Raj system, recognizing the importance of grassroots democracy and participatory governance. The Gram Sabha, as a village assembly, plays a vital role in local decision-making, planning, and implementation of development schemes.  Its constitutional recognition ensures its legal standing and empowers it to participate effectively in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Balwantray Mehta Committee report (1957) was instrumental in shaping the structure and functioning of the Panchayati Raj system, it did not specifically conceptualize the Gram Sabha as a constitutional entity.  The concept of Gram Sabha as a constitutional body emerged later, culminating in its explicit recognition in the 73rd Amendment.  The Mehta Committee focused primarily on the three-tier Panchayati Raj structure (village, intermediate, and district levels), without the same level of emphasis on the Gram Sabha as a distinct constitutional unit.  The evolution of the Gram Sabha's role and status within the Panchayati Raj system occurred over time, with the 73rd Amendment solidifying its constitutional position.


**7.  With reference to the functions of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for the recruitment of all civil servants in both the Union and State Governments.
2. The UPSC advises the President on matters related to the reservation of posts for the Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the UPSC plays a crucial role in the recruitment of civil servants at the Union level, it does not have the exclusive responsibility for recruitment in State Governments.  State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs) are responsible for the recruitment of civil servants in their respective states. The UPSC's role is primarily focused on the All-India Services and certain key positions in the Union Government.  The division of recruitment responsibilities between the UPSC and SPSCs reflects the federal structure of the Indian government.

Statement 2 is correct. The UPSC's functions include advising the President on matters relating to the reservation of posts for various categories, including Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.  This advisory role is crucial in ensuring that the principles of affirmative action are effectively implemented in government recruitment. The UPSC's expertise and impartiality are leveraged to ensure fairness and transparency in the reservation process.  Its recommendations are important in upholding the constitutional mandate for equitable representation of marginalized communities in the civil services.



**8.  With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to the President.
2. The Governor always acts with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor has executive, legislative, and some quasi-judicial powers, these are not exactly analogous to the President's powers. The President's powers are significantly broader and more extensive, reflecting their position as the head of state. The Governor's powers are exercised within the framework of the state government and are subject to various constitutional limitations and conventions.  The analogy is not complete because the President's position is more powerful and less subject to the influence of the executive branch at the national level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor is constitutionally bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in most matters.  This reflects the principle of responsible government, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.  There are certain exceptions where the Governor can exercise discretionary powers, such as in the appointment of the Chief Minister or the imposition of President's Rule.  However, in the general course of governance, the Governor is expected to act in accordance with the advice of the elected government.  This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy and ensures that the government is responsive to the will of the people.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the State Council of Ministers:**

1. The State Council of Ministers holds office during the pleasure of the Governor.
2. The words “during the pleasure of the Governor” imply that the Council of Ministers is accountable to the Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution stipulates that the State Council of Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor.  This means that the Governor has the power to dismiss the entire Council of Ministers.  However, in practice, this power is rarely exercised arbitrarily. The Council of Ministers is primarily accountable to the State Legislative Assembly, and the Governor's power to dismiss them is typically invoked only when the Council loses the confidence of the Assembly or engages in serious misconduct. The clause reflects a constitutional check on the executive's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Governor has the power to dismiss the Council of Ministers, the phrase "during the pleasure of the Governor" does *not* imply that the Council is directly accountable to the Governor.  The Council's primary accountability is to the State Legislative Assembly through the mechanism of confidence motions. The Governor's role is largely formal, and their power to dismiss the Council is primarily a safeguard against unconstitutional actions.  The phrase signifies the Governor's constitutional authority, but does not define the primary line of accountability.  The core principle of responsible government lies in the executive's accountability to the legislature.


**10. With reference to the CAG, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible only to the Parliament. This ensures its autonomy and impartiality in auditing government accounts.  The CAG's independence is crucial for maintaining financial accountability and transparency in government operations. Its reports are presented directly to the Parliament, allowing for public scrutiny of government finances and ensuring that public funds are utilized efficiently and effectively.  The CAG's independence from the executive branch is a key safeguard against financial mismanagement and corruption.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CAG audits the accounts of state governments, it does not compile and maintain them.  State governments maintain their own accounts, and the CAG audits these accounts to ensure their accuracy, propriety, and compliance with relevant regulations.  The CAG's role is to scrutinize and verify the accounts, not to create or manage them.  The division of responsibilities between the state governments and the CAG ensures a system of checks and balances in financial administration.


**11. With reference to the differences between a censure motion and a no-confidence motion, consider the following statements:**

1. A censure motion requires stating reasons for its adoption, while a no-confidence motion does not.
2. A no-confidence motion can only be moved against the Council of Ministers, unlike a censure motion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both censure motions and no-confidence motions require stating the reasons for their adoption.  These reasons are crucial for clarifying the grounds upon which the motion is based and enabling informed debate and discussion in the legislature.  The reasons outlined in the motion provide a basis for evaluating the government's actions and assessing its performance.  The absence of clearly stated reasons would undermine the purpose and effectiveness of such motions.

Statement 2 is correct.  A no-confidence motion is a specific mechanism used to express a lack of confidence in the entire Council of Ministers.  It is a formal procedure with specific rules and consequences. A censure motion, on the other hand, is a broader expression of disapproval, which can be directed at the Council of Ministers as a whole or individual ministers or a group of ministers.  The distinction reflects the different levels of severity and the different implications of each type of motion. A no-confidence motion directly challenges the government's legitimacy, while a censure motion expresses disapproval without necessarily leading to the government's downfall.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Ashok Mehta Committee's findings on the decline of Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. The committee identified bureaucracy's role as a significant factor contributing to the decline.
2. The committee highlighted the lack of gender parity as a primary reason for the decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ashok Mehta Committee's report extensively analyzed the factors contributing to the decline of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).  It identified the interference and excessive control by bureaucracy as a major impediment to the effective functioning of PRIs.  Bureaucratic control often stifled local initiative, undermined the autonomy of PRIs, and hindered their ability to address local needs effectively.  The committee advocated for greater devolution of power and responsibilities to PRIs to enhance their effectiveness and accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ashok Mehta Committee emphasized the need for greater participation and representation of various social groups within PRIs, it did not specifically identify the lack of gender parity as a *primary* reason for their decline.  The committee's focus was broader, encompassing factors like bureaucratic interference, lack of political will, and conceptual clarity.  While gender inequality undoubtedly affects the functioning of PRIs, it was not highlighted by the committee as a central cause of their decline.  The committee's analysis was more comprehensive, addressing systemic issues rather than focusing solely on gender-related concerns.


**13. With reference to the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayat system exists in all states of India except Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram.
2. The Gram Panchayat can continue for 3 years from the date of election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The statement accurately reflects the initial exclusion of Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram from the purview of the Panchayati Raj system.  This exception was made in recognition of the unique social and political contexts of these states, which have significant tribal populations and distinct customary governance systems.  The 73rd Amendment Act, while aiming for nationwide implementation, allowed for exceptions based on the specific circumstances of these states.  Subsequent developments might have altered this situation, but the initial provision was indeed as stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Gram Panchayat's term is five years, not three, from the date of its first meeting (as per the 73rd Amendment Act).  The five-year term provides a stable timeframe for planning and implementation of development projects and ensures continuity in local governance.  A shorter term could compromise the effectiveness of local bodies and lead to frequent changes in leadership, hindering long-term planning and implementation.  The five-year term is a standard feature of the Panchayati Raj system across most states.




**1. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced the principle of dyarchy at the provincial level, dividing powers between elected ministers and the Governor.
2. It significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a larger section of the Indian population, including women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, is correctly identified in statement 1 as introducing dyarchy at the provincial level. This system divided administrative responsibilities between elected Indian ministers and the Governor, who retained control over certain "reserved" subjects like law and order, finance, and irrigation.  This was a significant step towards self-governance, although it fell short of full responsible government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1919 Act did expand the franchise compared to previous acts, it did not grant voting rights to a significantly large section of the Indian population, certainly not including women in any substantial manner. The franchise was still limited based on property, income, or educational qualifications, excluding the vast majority of the Indian population, including almost all women.  The extension of the franchise was modest and primarily aimed at a limited elite, not a broad-based enfranchisement.  Subsequent acts would further expand the franchise, but the 1919 Act was a relatively small step in this direction.  The substantial expansion of suffrage for women would come much later.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1. The concept of Fundamental Rights is borrowed solely from the US Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the US Constitution significantly influenced the inclusion of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, the framers also drew inspiration from various other sources, including the constitutions of Ireland, the UK, and Canada.  The concept of Fundamental Rights, therefore, isn't a singular borrowing but a synthesis of ideas from multiple constitutional frameworks, adapted to suit the Indian context.  The specific rights and their formulation are unique to India.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core feature of the Directive Principles of State Policy is their non-justiciability.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are enforceable in courts of law, the Directive Principles are aspirational goals that guide the state's policymaking.  While courts may consider them in interpreting laws or policies, they cannot directly enforce their implementation.  This distinction reflects the framers' intention to balance individual liberties with social and economic objectives.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, combining elements of both federal and unitary features.
2. The distribution of powers between the Union and States is based solely on the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian federal system is often described as "quasi-federal" or "cooperative federalism" because it blends federal and unitary principles. While there's a division of powers between the Union and States, the Union government holds significant power through its legislative, executive, and financial dominance.  Features like the Union List, Concurrent List, and emergency powers allow the Union to intervene in state matters, blurring the lines of a strictly federal structure. This nuanced balance reflects India's unique historical and political context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Government of India Act, 1935, served as a template for certain aspects of India's federal structure, such as the division of powers into lists, the Indian Constitution significantly departed from it.  The 1935 Act was a product of colonial rule, and the Indian Constitution, drafted after independence, established a fundamentally different power structure, reflecting the aspirations of a sovereign nation.  The Indian Constitution's federal features are a result of both its framers' vision and the compromises made during its drafting.


**4. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha, being a permanent body, cannot be dissolved.
2.  A Money Bill, once passed by the Lok Sabha, cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, is a permanent body, unlike the Lok Sabha (lower house), which is subject to dissolution.  This feature is a key difference between the two houses, reflecting their different roles in the legislative process.  The Rajya Sabha's permanent nature ensures continuity in legislative matters and provides a check on the Lok Sabha's power.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Money Bills, which deal primarily with financial matters, are given special treatment in the Constitution.  Once passed by the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to a Money Bill within a stipulated time frame.  The Lok Sabha, however, is not obligated to accept these recommendations. This provision safeguards the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President can unilaterally dismiss the Council of Ministers.
2.  The President is the supreme commander of the armed forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President has the power to dismiss the Council of Ministers,  this power is not exercised unilaterally.  In practice, the President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, meaning that the dismissal of the Council of Ministers is contingent upon the loss of confidence in the government by the Lok Sabha. This reflects the principle of parliamentary supremacy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India is the nominal head of state and the supreme commander of the armed forces. This constitutional provision reflects the President's role as the symbol of national unity and authority in matters of national defence and security.  The actual operational command of the armed forces rests with the government, but the supreme authority remains vested in the President.


**6. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States.
2.  The High Courts have appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of lower courts within their respective states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in certain specific types of cases, including disputes between the Union government and one or more states, or between states themselves. This power is enshrined in the Constitution and is a crucial aspect of the Supreme Court's role in maintaining federal balance and resolving inter-state conflicts.

Statement 2 is also correct.  High Courts in India function as both courts of original jurisdiction (hearing cases directly) and appellate jurisdiction (hearing appeals from lower courts). Their appellate jurisdiction extends to the decisions of subordinate courts within their respective states, ensuring a fair and efficient judicial process at the state level.  This two-tiered structure is essential for the effective functioning of India's judicial system.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body, comprising a Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.
2.  The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections only to the Parliament and State Legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), and can include other Election Commissioners (ECs) appointed by the President.  The number of ECs can vary, and the Commission functions as a collegium, ensuring collective decision-making.  This structure ensures impartiality and prevents the dominance of any single individual.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the ECI is primarily known for conducting elections to Parliament and State Legislatures, its responsibilities extend beyond this.  The ECI also conducts elections to the offices of the President and Vice-President and plays a crucial role in overseeing the functioning of political parties, including resolving disputes relating to party splits or mergers.  Its jurisdiction covers various aspects of the electoral process and the maintenance of electoral integrity.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President for a fixed term and can only be removed through impeachment.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a fixed term and enjoys significant independence from the executive branch. The Constitution lays down a specific procedure for the removal of the CAG, which involves a process similar to impeachment, requiring a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament.  This safeguards the CAG's independence and ensures that audits are conducted impartially.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG's audit responsibilities encompass both the Union and State governments, extending to all ministries, departments, and public sector undertakings.  The CAG's reports provide crucial oversight of public expenditure and help ensure accountability in the use of public funds at both the Union and State levels.  This broad mandate reflects the CAG's vital role in safeguarding public finances.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission of India:**

1. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body, established under Article 280 of the Constitution.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission of India is a constitutional body established under Article 280 of the Indian Constitution. Its primary role is to recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States,  and to make recommendations on grants-in-aid to States from the Consolidated Fund of India.  Its establishment ensures a regular review of the financial relationships between the Union and States, promoting fiscal stability and equity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission are not legally binding on the Union and State governments. While the government generally accepts the recommendations, it retains the discretion to deviate from them, providing a degree of flexibility in policymaking.  However, the government's decision to deviate from the recommendations is usually accompanied by a detailed explanation justifying the deviation, maintaining a degree of transparency and accountability.  The Finance Commission's recommendations, though not binding, carry significant weight due to their expertise and impartiality.


**10. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is that the Directive Principles are non-justiciable.  They cannot be directly enforced by courts. While courts may consider the Directive Principles when interpreting laws or policies, they cannot issue orders for their direct implementation.  This reflects the framers' intention to create a balance between individual rights and social and economic goals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, represent the socio-economic vision of the framers. They aim to guide the state towards creating a welfare state, promoting social justice, and ensuring economic and social equality.  They embody the aspirations for a more equitable and just society, serving as guiding principles for policy formulation and implementation.  They are not mere idealistic statements but reflect a commitment to social welfare.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General of India can be a member of a committee of the Parliament.
2. The Attorney General of India has the right to vote in the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Attorney General of India, while not a member of Parliament, has the right to participate in the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament and any Parliamentary committee of which they are a member.  This right is explicitly granted by the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Attorney General's participation in Parliament is limited to speaking and taking part in proceedings; they do not have the right to vote.  This is a crucial distinction, highlighting their advisory role rather than a legislative one.  The Attorney General's role is to provide legal advice to the government and represent it in court, not to directly participate in legislative decision-making through voting.


**2. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG's salary is determined by the President of India.
2. The CAG is responsible for maintaining the accounts of both the Central and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's salary and other service conditions are determined by Parliament, not the President. This reflects the CAG's independence from the executive branch. The Constitution ensures the CAG's financial security and independence by vesting this power in the legislature.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the CAG audits the accounts of both Central and State Governments, they are not responsible for *maintaining* these accounts.  The CAG's primary role is auditing – verifying the accuracy and legality of government spending – not record-keeping. The responsibility for maintaining accounts rests with respective government departments and accounting offices. The separation of these functions is crucial to maintain audit independence.


**3. With reference to the office of the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General can be removed from office only by the Parliament through impeachment proceedings.
2. The Attorney General is a full-time government employee and cannot engage in private legal practice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Attorney General holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means they can be removed at any time by the President, without any specific parliamentary process like impeachment. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, which makes the Attorney General's tenure indirectly linked to the government's stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General is not a full-time government employee, and they are not prohibited from private legal practice. However, there are ethical considerations and restrictions on the types of cases they can handle to avoid conflicts of interest. These restrictions ensure that the Attorney General maintains their independence and impartiality while serving the government.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the CAG:**

1. The CAG has the power to prosecute individuals who violate financial laws while managing public finances.
2. The CAG exercises exchequer control on behalf of the Parliament during a national emergency declared by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG's reports can be used by investigating agencies to build cases against individuals for financial misconduct, the CAG itself does not possess the power to prosecute. The CAG's role is to audit and report; legal action is the responsibility of law enforcement and judicial bodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  In case of a national emergency or financial emergency, the CAG's role significantly expands.  They exercise exchequer control, ensuring that public funds are utilized efficiently and for the intended purpose, and that the government adheres to constitutional financial regulations.  This is a crucial aspect of parliamentary oversight during times of crisis.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is bound to accept the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers.
2. The President of India can withhold assent to any bill passed by Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President generally acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers,  there are certain exceptions, particularly in cases concerning matters of national importance or constitutional crisis.  The President's power to act independently, though rarely exercised, is a significant constitutional safeguard.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament. This is a significant check on legislative power.  While this power is rarely used, it represents a crucial constitutional safeguard to prevent the passage of potentially unconstitutional or harmful legislation.


**6. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2. The Finance Commission is responsible for allocating finances among Public Sector Undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  However, they carry significant weight and are generally accepted. The government can choose to deviate, but this needs to be justified and explained.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission is concerned with the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States and not with the internal financial management of Public Sector Undertakings.  The allocation of funds to PSUs is governed by other mechanisms and ministries.


**7. Consider the following statements about the appointment of the CAG:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a fixed term of six years.
2. The CAG can be removed from office only by impeachment by Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG is appointed by the President, but the term is not fixed at six years; it is six years or until they reach the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This provision aims to balance the need for experience with the need to prevent an overly long tenure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG can be removed from office by the President only on a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament, supported by a special majority.  This is a more stringent process than simple impeachment, reflecting the importance of the CAG's independence and the gravity of removing such a high-ranking official.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Economic Affairs is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2. The Union Budget must be approved by both Houses of Parliament before it can be implemented.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Department of Economic Affairs, under the Ministry of Finance, plays a central role in preparing the Union Budget. While other departments contribute, the DEA is the primary coordinating agency.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Union Budget, including the Demands for Grants and the Appropriation Bill, must receive the assent of both Houses of Parliament before it can be implemented. This ensures that the government's financial plans are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval.  The Lok Sabha's approval is particularly crucial, since it is directly elected by the people.


**9. With reference to the  Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates that one-third of the seats in Panchayats be reserved for women.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act makes the establishment of Gram Sabhas mandatory in all villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of at least one-third of the seats in Panchayats for women. This is a crucial step towards ensuring women's participation in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act recognizes the importance of Gram Sabhas, it does not make their establishment mandatory in all villages.  The formation and functioning of Gram Sabhas are subject to state-level legislation and may vary from state to state.  The Act emphasizes their role as a forum for local participation, but their existence isn't universally mandated by the Constitution itself.


**10. With reference to the  Advocate General of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Advocate General is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Advocate General has the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Advocate General of a State is appointed by the Governor of that State, not the President of India. This reflects the Advocate General's role as the chief legal advisor to the State Government.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Advocate General has the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of the State Legislature. Similar to the Attorney General at the national level, this right allows them to represent the state's interests and provide legal advice to the legislature.  However, like the Attorney General, the Advocate General does not have the right to vote in the legislature.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission can directly remove any government employee engaged in election-related duties for non-partisan behavior.
2. The Chief Election Commissioner's removal requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Election Commission can issue orders to government employees involved in election duties and take action against them for partisan behavior, it cannot directly remove them.  The removal process falls under the purview of the respective government departments. The EC's power lies in its ability to influence the actions of these employees through directives and disciplinary measures, not direct dismissal.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Constitution safeguards the Chief Election Commissioner's independence. They cannot be removed arbitrarily.  Removal requires a special process involving a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament, based on proven misbehavior or incapacity, and not simply a resolution.  This process emphasizes the high threshold for removing the CEC and protects their impartiality.  The process is more involved than a simple resolution and requires a very high level of scrutiny.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian electoral system:**

1.  The First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system is used exclusively for all elections in India, including local body elections.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to Panchayats and Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FPTP system is used for many elections in India, it is not used exclusively for all elections.  Other electoral systems, such as proportional representation, are employed for specific elections, particularly at the local level (Panchayats and Municipalities). The FPTP system is primarily used for parliamentary and state assembly elections.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Election Commission of India does not directly conduct elections to Panchayats and Municipalities. The conduct of these elections is governed by state-level election bodies set up under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments. Although the ECI provides guidance and oversight, the actual conduct and administration of these elections are delegated to the state-level bodies.



**3. With reference to the Indian President's election, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's election utilizes a system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.
2.  Each Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) possesses a vote of equal value across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Presidential election in India employs a system of proportional representation, but it's not based on the single transferable vote.  It's a complex system where the value of each vote varies depending on the population of the state the elector represents (MLAs) or the total membership of the house they belong to (MPs).  A single transferable vote system is not used.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The value of each MLA's vote is not equal across all states.  The value is determined by a formula that considers the state's population, ensuring that larger states have a proportionally higher influence in the election. This prevents over-representation of smaller states.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the removal of Election Commissioners:**

1. The President of India can remove an Election Commissioner without any prior consultation with Parliament.
2.  The grounds for removal of an Election Commissioner are explicitly defined in the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the President appoints the Election Commissioners, their removal isn't arbitrary.  The Constitution provides for a process involving Parliament, ensuring their independence and preventing unilateral removal. The President cannot remove an Election Commissioner without following the prescribed procedure.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Constitution outlines the process for removal, it doesn't explicitly define all the grounds for removal. The grounds are broad and include proven misbehavior or incapacity, requiring a thorough investigation and parliamentary approval before removal. The grounds are not specifically listed, but the process is clearly laid out in the Constitution.


**5. With reference to the functions of the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the offices of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha.
2.  The Election Commission resolves disputes concerning splits and mergers of recognized political parties.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission does not conduct elections for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha. These elections are conducted by the Lok Sabha itself.  The ECI's role is limited to the overall electoral process, not the internal elections within the legislative bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission has the authority to resolve disputes related to the splits and mergers of recognized political parties. This function is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the political party system and ensuring fair competition.  The ECI acts as an arbiter in these disputes to prevent manipulation.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliamentary system:**

1. The President of India can dissolve the Lok Sabha at any time, regardless of the government's majority status.
2. A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President of India cannot dissolve the Lok Sabha at will.  While the President has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, it's usually exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister, primarily when the government loses its majority support in the House.  The President acts as a constitutional head and cannot exercise this power without the advice of the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is correct.  A money bill, which deals with matters related to taxation and government finances, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater representation of the people and its primary responsibility for financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha on a money bill, but cannot amend it.


**7. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a rigid division of powers between the Centre and the States.
2. The Rajya Sabha provides equal representation to all states, irrespective of their population size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a flexible division of powers between the Centre and the States. The Constitution allows for a degree of flexibility and cooperation between levels of government, unlike a rigid system where powers are fixed and immutable.  The distribution of powers is not static and can change through legislative amendments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does *not* provide equal representation to all states. States are represented unequally in the Rajya Sabha, with larger states having a greater number of representatives than smaller states.  This reflects a compromise between population-based representation and representation of smaller states.



**8. Consider the following statements regarding the functions of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for all government services in India, including state-level services.
2.  The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India for a term of 6 years or until they attain the age of 62 years, whichever is earlier.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC primarily conducts examinations for the All India Services (IAS, IPS, etc.) and other central government services.  State-level services are usually recruited through state-level public service commissions. The UPSC's role is largely limited to central government recruitments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The retirement age for the Chairman and members of the UPSC is 65 years, not 62.  They hold office for a term of six years, or until they reach the age of 65, whichever comes first.  The retirement age is clearly defined in the Constitution.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to vote is a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The Constitution explicitly lays down the qualifications required for becoming a member of the Election Commission.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to vote is a constitutional right, not a fundamental right under Part III.  While it's a crucial aspect of democracy, it's enshrined in the Constitution through provisions related to elections, not as a fundamental right in Part III.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly define the qualifications for becoming a member of the Election Commission.  While some implied qualifications exist, such as high integrity and experience, the Constitution doesn't spell out specific legal, educational, or administrative requirements.  The President's discretion is paramount in appointing the members.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding political parties in India:**

1.  The Election Commission of India grants national party status based solely on the number of Lok Sabha seats won.
2.  A state party is recognized if it secures at least 6% of the valid votes polled in a state Assembly election and wins at least three seats.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission uses multiple criteria for granting national party status, not just Lok Sabha seats.  These criteria include vote share in various states and the number of Lok Sabha seats won across multiple states.  The criteria are complex and multifaceted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The conditions for recognizing a state party are more nuanced.  While securing 6% of the votes is one criterion, the number of seats won can vary.  A party might qualify even with fewer than three seats if it meets other specified conditions laid down by the Election Commission. The criteria are clearly defined but not so straightforward as mentioned in the statement.


**1. With reference to the National Social Assistance Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Programme primarily fulfills the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of India.
2. The Programme significantly contributes to the Directive Principles of State Policy, aiming for social security and welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a flagship social security scheme of the Government of India.  While the program indirectly supports the overall goal of a just and equitable society envisioned by Fundamental Rights, its core function aligns more directly with the Directive Principles of State Policy.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, providing social security and reducing economic inequality. NSAP, by providing financial assistance to the elderly, widows, and disabled, directly contributes to this objective.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as the NSAP doesn't directly enforce or fulfill specific Fundamental Rights.  The program operates within the framework of the Constitution, but its primary impact is on fulfilling the social and economic goals outlined in the Directive Principles.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the program's core function and its relationship with the constitutional provisions.  The NSAP's focus on social security and welfare makes it a key instrument for achieving the socio-economic goals outlined in the Directive Principles.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's advisory role, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can offer legal advice to the President of India solely on matters concerning the Fundamental Rights of citizens.
2. The Supreme Court can provide advice to the President of India on its own initiative, particularly on issues of significant public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India possesses advisory jurisdiction, allowing it to provide legal opinions to the President. However, this power is not limited to Fundamental Rights issues.  The Court can advise on various matters of law and fact. Statement 1 is thus incorrect.  Crucially, the Supreme Court can offer advice on its own initiative, particularly when matters of significant public interest are involved.  This proactive role allows the Court to address pressing constitutional concerns without needing a direct request from the President. Statement 2 accurately reflects this aspect of the Supreme Court's advisory role. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either over-restrict the Court's advisory powers or misrepresent its ability to act proactively. The Supreme Court's ability to provide advice on its own initiative is a crucial aspect of its role in upholding the Constitution and protecting public interest, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats primarily function to resolve matters pending before courts, focusing on pre-litigative stage disputes.
2. Lok Adalats exclusively deal with civil disputes, excluding criminal cases from their jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lok Adalats are informal dispute resolution mechanisms designed to provide speedy and inexpensive justice.  While they can settle pre-litigative disputes, their primary function is to resolve matters already pending before courts. This includes both civil and criminal cases.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Adalats are not restricted to only civil cases; they can handle a range of disputes, including those of a criminal nature, but primarily focus on those that can be resolved through compromise and conciliation. Statement 2 is also incorrect.   Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope and function of Lok Adalats.  The ability of Lok Adalats to handle both pre-litigative and pending cases, encompassing civil and criminal matters, is a key feature of their mechanism for dispute resolution.


**4. With reference to the "Instrument of Instructions," consider the following statements:**

1. The "Instrument of Instructions" from the Government of India Act 1935 were directly incorporated into the Constitution of India as Fundamental Rights.
2. The principles outlined in the "Instrument of Instructions" were integrated into the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 included "Instrument of Instructions" that provided guidance to the Governor-General and Governors on matters of governance.  These instructions were not directly adopted as Fundamental Rights. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, many of the principles and ideals contained within the "Instrument of Instructions" found their way into the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution of India.  These principles, while not legally enforceable, guide the state towards social and economic justice. Statement 2 reflects this incorporation of ideals. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the relationship between the "Instrument of Instructions" and the constitutional provisions.  The indirect influence of the 1935 Act's guiding principles on the Directive Principles is a significant aspect of the Constitution's evolution, making statement 2 the accurate reflection of this historical transition.


**5. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to Parliament.
2. The Department of Expenditure plays a crucial role in the Union Budget's preparation and presentation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament is a complex process involving multiple government departments. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role, particularly in tax-related aspects, it is not solely responsible. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Department of Expenditure is centrally involved in formulating the budget, managing government spending, and overseeing its implementation. This department plays a crucial role in the budgetary process. Statement 2 accurately reflects its importance. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the division of responsibilities in the Union Budget preparation.  The collaborative nature of the process, with the Department of Expenditure playing a key role, highlights the complexity of this crucial governmental function, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy exclusively applies to individuals affected by land acquisition for projects, excluding those displaced due to other reasons.
2. The Ministry of Rural Development was the primary agency responsible for formulating this policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, addresses the issue of displacement and rehabilitation of people affected by various development projects.  The policy's scope is not limited to land acquisition for projects; it also encompasses involuntary displacement due to other reasons, such as natural disasters or industrial development. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The policy was not formulated solely by the Ministry of Rural Development. Multiple ministries and departments contributed to its development, reflecting the multi-faceted nature of displacement issues. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the policy's scope and the governmental agencies involved in its creation. The comprehensive nature of the policy and the involvement of multiple ministries demonstrate a holistic approach to the complex problem of displacement and resettlement, making statement (d) the correct answer.


**7. With reference to Consumer Disputes Redressal at the district level, consider the following statements:**

1. A State Government cannot establish more than one District Forum within a single district.
2. The District Forum must include at least one woman member.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consumer Protection Act provides for the establishment of District Forums to address consumer grievances.  State Governments are permitted to establish more than one District Forum in a district if deemed necessary to handle the volume of cases effectively.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Act mandates that at least one member of the District Forum must be a woman, ensuring gender representation in the consumer redressal mechanism. Statement 2 accurately reflects this requirement. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the legal framework governing the establishment and composition of District Forums. The flexibility in the number of forums per district and the mandatory inclusion of a woman member are key aspects of the consumer protection legislation, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the State Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Finance Commission recommends principles for determining taxes appropriated by Panchayats at the state level.
2. The State Finance Commission is responsible for allocating financial resources to District Planning Committees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

State Finance Commissions are constituted to review the financial position of Panchayats and Municipalities at the state level.  A primary function is to recommend principles for determining the taxes and duties that can be levied and appropriated by these local bodies. Statement 1 accurately describes this crucial role.  However, the allocation of financial resources to District Planning Committees is not directly under the purview of the State Finance Commission.  Other mechanisms and agencies handle this aspect of resource allocation. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly portray the responsibilities of the State Finance Commission. The Commission's pivotal role in guiding the financial autonomy of local governments, particularly in recommending tax principles for Panchayats, makes statement 1 the correct answer.


**9. With reference to taxes on stock exchange transactions, consider the following statements:**

1.  These taxes are exclusively levied by the Union Government of India.
2. These taxes are collected by State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Taxes on transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets are primarily levied by the Union Government of India. While states might collect some related taxes, the central government has the primary authority in this area.  Statement 1 correctly identifies this. Statement 2 is incorrect as the primary collection of these taxes rests with the Union. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the central government's primary role in levying these taxes. The Union's authority in this domain stems from its constitutional powers over financial matters, making statement 1 the correct answer.


**10. With reference to the Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act, 1992, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the establishment of State Election Commissions to conduct all Panchayat elections.
2. The Act does not require the constitution of District Planning Committees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act significantly strengthened Panchayati Raj Institutions. However, while it empowers the establishment of State Election Commissions to conduct Panchayat elections, it doesn't mandate it universally.  The specific implementation details are left to the states. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Act also mandates the constitution of District Planning Committees to involve local bodies in the planning process. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly represent the provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act.  The Act's provisions on State Election Commissions and District Planning Committees highlight the decentralized nature of its implementation, making statement (d) the correct response.


**11.  With reference to the benefits available to persons with disabilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The law guarantees preferential allotment of land for setting up businesses for persons with disabilities.
2. Free schooling until the age of 18 is mandated by law for persons with disabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legislation concerning persons with disabilities aims to provide them with equal opportunities and support.  While preferential allotment of land might be considered under certain state-specific schemes, it's not a guaranteed right under national legislation.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Free and compulsory education up to the age of 18 is a fundamental right for all children, including those with disabilities, as per the Right to Education Act. Statement 2 accurately reflects this provision. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the legal guarantees for persons with disabilities.  The focus on education as a fundamental right, particularly for children with disabilities, underscores the commitment to inclusive development, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**12. With reference to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India alone authorizes withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary repository of government revenue.  While the President plays a constitutional role, the actual authorization for withdrawals rests with the Parliament.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers and based on Parliamentary approval.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Parliament's approval is essential for any expenditure from the Consolidated Fund, ensuring democratic control over public finances.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the process of authorizing withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund.  Parliamentary oversight and approval of government spending are fundamental to democratic governance, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**13. With reference to the "Look East Policy," consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy aimed primarily to fill the geopolitical void created by the end of the Cold War.
2. The policy sought to revive historical and cultural ties with Southeast and East Asian nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's "Look East Policy," later evolved into the "Act East Policy," had multiple objectives. While it did seek to enhance India's regional influence and leverage opportunities arising from the end of the Cold War, this was not its sole aim. Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplifies the policy's motives.  A core component was to strengthen relationships with neighboring countries in Southeast and East Asia, based on shared history, culture, and economic interests. Statement 2 correctly highlights this crucial aspect. Options (a), (b), and (d) present an incomplete picture of the policy's goals.  The policy's multifaceted approach, combining geopolitical considerations with cultural and economic diplomacy, makes option (c) the most comprehensive answer.


**14. With reference to the Union Budget's fate if not passed by the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Budget is automatically referred to the Rajya Sabha for suggestions.
2. The Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, is required to resign.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial element of the government's financial plan.  If the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, fails to pass the Budget, the government loses its financial legitimacy and is constitutionally obligated to resign. Statement 2 accurately reflects this crucial consequence. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, does not have the power to directly amend or reject the budget.  While it can offer suggestions, the Lok Sabha's approval is paramount. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the constitutional implications of the Lok Sabha's failure to pass the Union Budget.  The government's accountability to the Lok Sabha on budgetary matters is fundamental to the parliamentary system of governance, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**15. With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution provides a legislative process to enforce Fundamental Duties.
2.  Fundamental Duties are directly correlated with legal duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties, added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment, outline the moral obligations of citizens towards the nation.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable (enforceable in court), Fundamental Duties are not directly enforceable through a specific legislative process. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  While there's a connection between Fundamental Duties and broader legal obligations, they are not directly correlated in a legally binding way.  Fundamental Duties are aspirational in nature, promoting civic responsibility. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly portray the nature and enforceability of Fundamental Duties.  The distinction between the justiciable nature of Fundamental Rights and the aspirational character of Fundamental Duties is key, making statement (d) the correct answer.


**16. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's primary function is to encourage foreign capital inflow for infrastructure development.
2. The Finance Commission ensures transparency in financial administration across the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's mandate is to review the financial distribution between the Union and State governments.  It does not directly involve itself in promoting foreign capital inflow for infrastructure, which is handled by other agencies. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations contribute to fiscal transparency, its primary focus is not on ensuring transparency across all aspects of financial administration.  Other bodies and mechanisms deal with this broader objective. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly represent the Finance Commission's role and functions.  The Commission's specific focus on intergovernmental financial relations is central to its constitutional function, making statement (d) the accurate response.


**17. With reference to Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, consider the following:**

1.  The Right to Food is explicitly recognized as a Human Right.
2. The Right to Equal Access to Public Service is explicitly recognized as a Human Right.

Which of the above is/are Human Right/Human Rights under the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) outlines fundamental human rights. While the UDHR promotes social and economic rights, the Right to Food is not explicitly stated as a separate, independent right. Although implicitly supported through the right to an adequate standard of living, it is not a distinctly listed right.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The UDHR emphasizes the importance of equal opportunities and non-discrimination, but doesn't explicitly mention a right to equal access to public service as a distinct right.  This right is implicitly included within the broader context of equality and non-discrimination. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly interpret the UDHR's provisions.  The UDHR's emphasis on the right to an adequate standard of living, although not explicitly mentioning the "Right to Food" as a distinct right, makes option (a) the most appropriate response.


**18. With reference to Metropolitan Planning Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. Metropolitan Planning Committees are established under the provisions of the Constitution of India.
2. Metropolitan Planning Committees are solely responsible for implementing government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Metropolitan Planning Committees are established through legislation, not directly through the Constitution of India.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  These committees prepare development plans, but the implementation of government-sponsored schemes involves multiple agencies and stakeholders.  Metropolitan Planning Committees do not possess sole responsibility for implementation. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the legal basis and functions of Metropolitan Planning Committees. The collaborative nature of urban planning and implementation, with the Metropolitan Planning Committees playing a key role in planning, but not exclusive implementation, makes statement (d) the correct answer.


**19. With reference to "vote-on-account" and "interim budget," consider the following statements:**

1. A "vote-on-account" is used by a caretaker government, while an "interim budget" is used by a regular government.
2. A "vote-on-account" only deals with expenditure, whereas an "interim budget" includes both expenditure and receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A "vote-on-account" is a short-term measure to allow the government to meet its essential expenditure needs, typically when a new budget is delayed.  It is not exclusive to caretaker governments; regular governments also use it if the budget process is delayed.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  A "vote-on-account" deals primarily with expenditure, not receipts.  An "interim budget," on the other hand, is a full budget presented for a shorter period (often till the next full budget).  It includes both expenditure and receipts. Statement 2 correctly highlights this difference. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the specific uses and scopes of "vote-on-account" and "interim budget." The distinct natures of these budgetary instruments, particularly concerning their scope and usage, make statement 2 the correct answer.


**20. With reference to the distribution of powers in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme for the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is based on the Morley-Minto Reforms, 1909.
2. The scheme for the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is based on the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution's federal structure, dividing powers between the Centre and the States, is not based on the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909. These reforms introduced limited representative elements in the legislative councils but didn't establish a comprehensive framework for federal power-sharing. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1935, significantly shaped the Indian federal system by introducing a three-tiered system of government (federal, provincial, and concurrent lists). This Act's framework directly influenced the distribution of powers in the Indian Constitution. Statement 2 correctly points to this influence. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical development of the Indian federal system. The 1935 Act's foundational role in shaping the distribution of powers between the Centre and States makes statement 2 the correct answer.


**21. With reference to the Gram Sabha's role under the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Sabhas have the power to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.
2. Gram Sabhas have ownership of minor forest produce in Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.  Gram Sabhas have significant powers related to land management, including preventing alienation of land within their jurisdiction.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this power.  However, ownership of minor forest produce is not automatically vested in Gram Sabhas under PESA.  While they have rights over the use and management of such produce, the specific ownership rights might vary depending on local customs and regulations. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the Gram Sabha's powers under PESA.  The Act's emphasis on empowering Gram Sabhas in land management, particularly preventing alienation, makes statement 1 the correct answer.


**22. With reference to the purpose of an adjournment motion in the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. An adjournment motion is used to discuss matters of urgent public importance.
2. An adjournment motion is primarily intended to allow opposition members to gather information from ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

An adjournment motion is a parliamentary procedure used to interrupt the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.  It's not primarily designed for information gathering by opposition members, though that might be a secondary outcome. Statement 1 correctly describes its core purpose.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the primary function is not information gathering but rather to bring urgent matters to the immediate attention of the House. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the primary function of an adjournment motion.  The motion's critical role in addressing urgent public concerns makes statement 1 the correct answer.


**23. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act is based on the Right to Healthy Environment, interpreted as part of the Right to Life under Article 21.
2. The Act's provisions are primarily based on the powers and functions of Gram Sabhas as mentioned under Article 243A.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted to provide a specialized mechanism for addressing environmental issues.  The Act is closely linked to the Right to a Healthy Environment, which is considered a part of the Right to Life (Article 21) under judicial interpretation.  Statement 1 correctly reflects this legal basis.  The Act's provisions are not primarily based on the powers of Gram Sabhas (Article 243A), which relate to local governance.  The Tribunal's jurisdiction is at a national level. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misinterpret the legal foundations of the National Green Tribunal Act.  The Act's strong link to the Right to Life and a Healthy Environment under Article 21 makes statement 1 the correct answer.


**24. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles primarily aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.
2.  The provisions of the Directive Principles are legally enforceable by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy guide the state towards social and economic justice.  They aim to establish a welfare state with a strong emphasis on socio-economic equality and development. Statement 1 correctly reflects this objective. However, unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for policy-making and legislative action but don't provide individuals with a legal right to demand their implementation. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nature and legal status of the Directive Principles.  The aspirational nature of the Directive Principles and their role in shaping social and economic policy, while not being legally enforceable, makes statement 1 the correct answer.


**25. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha in financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can vote on the Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, has limited powers regarding financial matters.  It cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha also does not have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants; this power rests exclusively with the Lok Sabha. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly portray the Rajya Sabha's financial powers.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, making statement (d) the correct answer.


**26. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. The Act clearly defined the jurisdiction of the central and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced significant changes to the Indian governance system.  While it did not explicitly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature, it did establish a clearer delineation of powers between the central and provincial governments through the introduction of dyarchy.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Act significantly advanced the division of powers between the central and provincial governments, establishing a more defined jurisdictional framework.  Statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the aspects of the 1919 Act. The Act's primary impact on the division of powers between central and provincial levels makes statement 2 the correct answer.


**27. With reference to the procedure for passing a bill referred to a joint sitting of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The bill needs to be passed by a simple majority of members present and voting.
2. The bill needs to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of both houses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

When a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it needs to be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting.  A two-thirds majority is not required in this scenario. Statement 1 is therefore correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the voting requirements for passing bills in a joint sitting. The simple majority requirement for passing bills in a joint sitting is a key feature of the parliamentary legislative process, making statement 1 the correct answer.


**28. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Human Rights Commission.
2. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog, the National Institution for Transforming India, was established in 2015.  It did not replace the Human Rights Commission; these are distinct institutions with different mandates. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, marking a shift in the approach to economic planning and development. Statement 2 accurately reflects this change. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nature and purpose of NITI Aayog.  The replacement of the Planning Commission by NITI Aayog is a significant development in India's governance structure, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**29. With reference to the Executive Power of the Union of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union of India is vested in the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Executive Power of the Union of India is vested in the President, not the Prime Minister. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board, overseeing matters related to civil service appointments and administration. Statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the distribution of executive power in the Union government. The Prime Minister's role as Chairman of the Civil Services Board, while not the primary executive power, is a significant aspect of their responsibilities, making statement 2 the correct answer.


**30. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth and Sixth Schedules primarily aim to protect the interests of all border states.
2. The Fifth and Sixth Schedules primarily aim to protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution deal with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas. While the Schedules do not explicitly mention border states, their primary focus is on the governance and welfare of Scheduled Tribes in specific regions of the country. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Schedules provide special provisions for the administration of these areas, ensuring the protection of tribal rights and cultural practices. Statement 2 accurately reflects this purpose. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the Schedules' primary focus.

**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to vote is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The Election Commission of India's composition, powers, and functions are detailed in Part XV of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Constitution guarantees the right to vote in Article 326,  it's not classified as a Fundamental Right in Part III.  Fundamental Rights are those rights that are considered essential for the well-being of citizens and are justiciable in courts. The right to vote is a Constitutional right, guaranteed by the Constitution and essential for the functioning of a democracy, but it is not listed among the Fundamental Rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  Part XV of the Indian Constitution (Articles 324-329) specifically deals with the Election Commission of India.  It outlines the Commission's composition (currently a single Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners), its independence, its powers to supervise, direct, and control elections, and its role in resolving election disputes.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President's rule in a state:**

1.  The President's rule can be imposed only if the state government fails to function according to the Constitution (Article 356).
2.  The imposition of President's rule automatically dissolves the state legislative assembly.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 356 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to impose President's rule (also known as Governor's rule) in a state if the state government cannot function according to the provisions of the Constitution. This can happen due to various reasons, including breakdown of law and order, internal disturbances, or failure of the constitutional machinery.  The decision to impose President's rule is based on a report from the Governor and is subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the imposition of President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it is not mandatory.  The President can choose to keep the assembly in session, particularly if there is a possibility of restoring a stable government. The decision to dissolve the assembly is at the discretion of the President, based on the specific circumstances of the situation.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a strong central government with significant powers over the states.
2.  The Rajya Sabha provides equal representation to all states, ensuring parity in the federal structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indian federal system, while having features of both federal and unitary systems, leans towards a strong center.  The Union List contains numerous subjects where only the central government can legislate.  Moreover, the central government has significant powers in areas like finance, defense, and foreign affairs.  While states have autonomy over certain subjects (State List and Concurrent List), the central government's influence is considerable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, does *not* provide equal representation to all states.  The representation of states in the Rajya Sabha is unequal, with larger states having a greater number of representatives than smaller states.  This reflects a compromise in the design of the federal system, balancing the need for representation of smaller states with the political realities of larger states.


**4. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments provide a constitutional basis for Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipalities respectively.
2.  Local self-government bodies have complete financial autonomy and are not dependent on state governments for funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 and the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 are landmark legislation that provide a constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels and Municipalities respectively.  These amendments aim to empower local governance by giving these bodies specific powers and responsibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While local self-government bodies have been given powers to raise some revenue through taxation and other means, they are not entirely financially autonomous.  They are significantly dependent on grants and funding from the state governments.  The state governments play a crucial role in allocating resources and overseeing the financial health of these local bodies.  Their financial independence is limited and varies across states depending on the state’s specific laws and policies.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 110 of the Indian Constitution defines a Money Bill and stipulates that only the Lok Sabha can introduce such bills.  This reflects the principle of financial control vested in the lower house, directly elected by the people. The Rajya Sabha has limited powers over Money Bills; it can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill. It can only return the bill to the Lok Sabha with its recommendations within 14 days of its receipt.  The Lok Sabha can then either accept or reject the recommendations. If the Lok Sabha does not accept the recommendations, the bill is deemed to have been passed by the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha’s power is limited to recommending amendments, not to vetoing the bill.


**6. With reference to the Indian Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2.  The President appoints the Prime Minister and, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoints other ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian parliamentary system operates on the principle of collective responsibility. This means that the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  If the Lok Sabha expresses a lack of confidence in the government through a no-confidence motion, the entire council must resign.  This ensures that the executive branch is answerable to the elected representatives of the people.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, then appoints other ministers to the council.  While the President has the formal power of appointment, the actual choice of ministers rests with the Prime Minister, reflecting the reality of the parliamentary system.


**7. With reference to the judicial system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court of India is the final court of appeal in all matters.
2.  The High Courts are established by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India stands at the apex of the Indian judicial system.  It is the final court of appeal, meaning that its decisions are binding on all other courts in the country.  Its judgments have the force of law and can interpret the Constitution and laws passed by Parliament.  It also has original jurisdiction in certain matters, such as disputes between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. High Courts in India are established under Article 214 of the Constitution by the Parliament.  While Parliament has the power to create new High Courts or alter their jurisdiction, the *establishment* of High Courts is a constitutional function, not merely a legislative one. The constitution already has provisions for High Courts.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Finance Commission of India:**

1.  The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States.
2.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission are binding on the Union Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 280 of the Indian Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years.  The Commission's primary role is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and the grant of financial assistance from the Union to the States.  It plays a crucial role in maintaining financial balance between the Union and State governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and generally followed by the Union Government, they are not legally binding.  The government can choose to deviate from the recommendations, but it must provide reasons for doing so.  The recommendations are advisory in nature, but their weight and importance in shaping fiscal policy are significant.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that all government bodies proactively disclose information related to their functioning.
2.  The Act provides for penalties for those who refuse to provide information under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information Act, 2005, aims to promote transparency and accountability in government.  A key feature of the Act is the requirement for public authorities to proactively disclose information, making it readily accessible to citizens without the need for formal requests. This proactive disclosure includes information on the organization's structure, functions, budget, policies, and decision-making processes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act provides mechanisms to ensure compliance and address instances of non-compliance. It includes provisions for penalties for public information officers and other officials who refuse to provide information or obstruct the process.  These penalties can include fines and other disciplinary actions.


**10. With reference to the Governor of a state, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.  While the President exercises this power, the selection process often involves consultations with the central government and the ruling party in the state.  The appointment is a formal act, but the political considerations are essential in the selection of a governor.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor holds office "during the pleasure of the President." This means that the President can remove the Governor at any time, without assigning any reason.  This provision gives the central government considerable influence over state governments, even though the states have a significant degree of autonomy.  The "pleasure of the President" is a significant check and balance on the power of the state government.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the 73rd Amendment Act on Panchayati Raj:**

1.  The Act mandates that one-third of the total seats in Panchayats be reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.
2.  The Act stipulates that periodic elections to Panchayats must be held every five years, ensuring regular representation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates that at least one-third of the total seats in Panchayats be reserved for women.  However, this reservation is *in addition* to the seats already reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) women.  The statement incorrectly implies a total disregard for existing SC/ST women's reservations.  The Act aims for inclusive representation, not to replace existing reservations.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act makes it mandatory to hold regular elections to Panchayats every five years. This ensures the continuous functioning of these local governing bodies and regular democratic participation at the grassroots level.  This is a crucial provision for promoting decentralized governance and empowering local communities.  The periodic elections are a cornerstone of the Act's effectiveness.


**2. With reference to the provisions of the 74th Amendment Act on Municipalities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act specifies that the procedure for maintaining accounts and auditing municipal finances should be determined by the State Governor.
2.  The Act establishes Nagar Panchayats as local governing bodies for smaller urban areas, promoting tiered urban governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act does not grant the State Governor the authority to decide the procedures for maintaining accounts and auditing municipal finances.  This responsibility typically lies with the state legislature, which establishes the framework for municipal financial management and accountability. The Governor's role is primarily executive, not legislative or regulatory in this specific context.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act introduces the concept of Nagar Panchayats to govern smaller urban areas. This is a significant aspect of the Act, aiming to create a tiered structure of urban local governance, catering to the diverse needs of different-sized urban settlements. This layered approach ensures effective management and service delivery across the urban spectrum.


**3. With reference to the office of the Governor in a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to those of the President of India.
2. The Governor always acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except in situations where discretionary powers are explicitly granted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor's powers are extensive, they are not entirely analogous to the President's.  The President is the head of state, while the Governor is the head of state administration within their respective state.  The President's powers are broader, particularly in areas of national security and international relations, which are not under the purview of a state governor. The Governor does not have judicial powers; their role is primarily executive and legislative.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The Governor is constitutionally bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in most matters. However, there are limited exceptions where the Governor can exercise discretionary powers, such as in the appointment of the Chief Minister, or during a constitutional crisis.  The statement correctly emphasizes the general rule of ministerial advice but acknowledges that some exceptions exist.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Chief Minister of a state:**

1. The Chief Minister holds office until the pleasure of the Governor.
2. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chief Minister holds office during the pleasure of the Governor. This means the Governor can dismiss the Chief Minister at any time, although this is typically done only if the Chief Minister loses the confidence of the legislative assembly.  This reflects the principle of responsible government in a parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister. However, this appointment is largely a formality; the Governor is constitutionally obliged to appoint the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the state legislative assembly.  The Governor's role here is largely ceremonial, reflecting the democratic principle of majority rule.


**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAG is responsible for compiling and maintaining the accounts of both the Union and State governments.
2.  The CAG has control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments. This is a crucial function for ensuring financial accountability and transparency in public spending.  The CAG's audit reports are vital for parliamentary oversight of government finances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG does not have direct control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.  This power rests with the Parliament, which authorizes expenditure through the budget process.  The CAG's role is to audit the expenditure after it has been incurred, ensuring that it conforms to the approved budget and relevant regulations.  The CAG's role is to ensure accountability, not to control the disbursement of funds.


**6. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when specifically requested by the President of India.
2. Parliament has the power to extend the functions of the UPSC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC primarily serves the Union government. However, it can also be involved in the recruitment and selection processes of state governments if specifically requested by the President of India.  This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Indian federal system and the role of the President as the head of state.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution empowers Parliament to expand the functions of the UPSC. This flexibility allows for adapting the UPSC's role to changing administrative needs and demands.  The Parliament's authority over this matter reinforces its legislative supremacy in shaping the administrative structure of the nation.


**7. With reference to the President's rule in a state, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can impose President's rule only under Article 356 of the Constitution.
2.  The imposition of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 356 of the Constitution provides the legal framework for the President to impose President's rule in a state if the state government fails to function according to constitutional provisions.  This is a significant power, used sparingly, to address constitutional breakdowns in state governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the imposition of President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it is not mandatory.  The President can choose to keep the assembly in place or dissolve it depending on the specific circumstances and the advice provided by the Union government.  The decision is based on a comprehensive assessment of the situation, not a pre-determined rule.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Lok Sabha:**

1.  A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Lok Sabha has the power to reject or amend a money bill passed by the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce a money bill. This reflects the principle of financial control vested in the lower house, which is directly elected by the people.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha on a money bill; it cannot initiate or fundamentally alter it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject or significantly amend a money bill.  It can only make recommendations; the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on money bills, reflecting its primary role in financial matters.


**9. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.
2.  The Rajya Sabha cannot discuss the Annual Financial Statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, being the upper house, does not have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha, reflecting the principle of financial control residing with the directly elected house.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and provide recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the Annual Financial Statement, although it cannot vote on it. The discussion allows the upper house to provide valuable input and scrutiny of the government's financial plans.  The discussion is an important part of the parliamentary process, ensuring that the budget is thoroughly examined.


**10. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body.
2. The NDC is responsible for preparing the Five-Year Plans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body; it was established by a resolution of the government.  Its composition and functions are not enshrined in the Constitution.  While it plays a significant role in national planning and development, it lacks the constitutional backing enjoyed by bodies like the Election Commission or the UPSC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NDC plays a crucial role in the planning process, it does not directly prepare the Five-Year Plans. The Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) was the body primarily responsible for preparing these plans, with the NDC serving as a forum for consultation and coordination between the Union and State governments.  The NDC’s role is advisory and coordinating rather than the primary planning body.


**11. Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. They provide a socioeconomic framework for the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable; they cannot be enforced by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to pursue social and economic justice, but they are not legally binding in the same way as Fundamental Rights. This distinction is important for understanding the nature of the Indian Constitution's approach to social and economic policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to create a socioeconomic framework for the nation, promoting social welfare and economic equality.  They guide the state's policies and actions towards achieving a more just and equitable society.  They represent the aspirational goals of the Constitution, shaping the state's efforts to improve the lives of its citizens.


**12. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2.  All expenditures from the Consolidated Fund of India require prior authorization from Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha, and only after it is passed by the Lok Sabha does it go to the Rajya Sabha for consideration and approval.  This reflects the Lok Sabha’s primary role in financial matters. While the Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments, it cannot reject a money bill.

Statement 2 is correct. All expenditures from the Consolidated Fund of India, the primary source of government funds, require the prior approval of Parliament. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government is accountable for its spending.  The budget process is a crucial mechanism for parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**13. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India appoints the Finance Commission, as mandated by the Constitution. This ensures the independence and impartiality of this crucial body, responsible for distributing tax revenues between the Union and State governments.  The Presidential appointment underscores the significance of this body in the Indian federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential, they are not legally binding on the Union and State governments.  The government can accept or reject these recommendations, but it is expected to give due consideration to the Commission's findings, as they are based on thorough research and analysis.  The government's acceptance or rejection of the recommendations is subject to political considerations.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Gram Sabha:**

1. The Gram Sabha is a constitutional body.
2. The Gram Sabha has the power to prevent the alienation of land in scheduled areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act grants constitutional status to the Gram Sabha, recognizing its importance in local self-governance. This constitutional recognition strengthens the Gram Sabha's position and authority within the Panchayati Raj system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, empowers the Gram Sabha to play a crucial role in preventing the alienation of land in scheduled areas.  This power is designed to protect the land rights of tribal communities and prevent exploitation.  This is a critical aspect of protecting the interests of indigenous populations.


**15. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is not a single-member body. While it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, it also includes other Election Commissioners, whose number is determined by the government from time to time.  The multiple-member structure ensures a degree of checks and balances in the decision-making process of the Election Commission.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.  This power is crucial for ensuring that elections are conducted fairly and efficiently. The Commission's independence in this matter is essential for maintaining faith in the democratic process.


**16. With reference to the Governor's power to promulgate ordinances, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor's ordinance-making power is co-extensive with the legislative power of the State Legislature.
2.  The Governor can promulgate an ordinance only when the State Legislature is not in session.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor's power to promulgate ordinances is co-extensive with the legislative power of the State Legislature. This means that the Governor can issue ordinances on any subject that the State Legislature has the power to legislate upon.  This power is used in exceptional circumstances when the Legislature is not in session, and immediate action is required.

Statement 2 is correct. Ordinances are issued by the Governor when the State Legislature is not in session. This is a crucial limitation on the Governor's ordinance-making power, preventing abuse of this extraordinary power and ensuring that the Legislature has an opportunity to review and approve or reject the legislation.  The requirement that the Legislature be not in session limits the scope of ordinance making.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Council of Ministers:**

1. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament.
2. The Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament. This means that the entire council must resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha. This principle is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the executive remains accountable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is correct.  Union Ministers hold their office during the pleasure of the President. While this seems to give the President significant power, in reality, it reflects the principle of collective responsibility.  The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, and Ministers typically remain in office as long as the government retains the confidence of the Parliament. The President's power is largely a formality in this context.


**18.  With reference to the concept of a "Welfare State" in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of a "Welfare State" is enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy provide the framework for a "Welfare State."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble mentions "justice, social, economic and political," it does not explicitly define India as a "Welfare State." The Preamble sets out the broad objectives and ideals of the Constitution, but does not define the specific mechanisms to achieve them.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, provide a framework for establishing a "Welfare State."  These principles outline the state's responsibility to provide social and economic security to its citizens, promoting a just and equitable society. They guide the state's policies and actions towards achieving this goal.  The DPSPs are the primary constitutional expression of the welfare state ideal.


**19. With reference to the process of amending the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. An amendment to the Constitution can be initiated only by introducing a Bill in the Lok Sabha.
2. If an amendment seeks to alter the federal character of the Constitution, it requires ratification by the legislatures of all the states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While a Bill to amend the Constitution can be introduced in the Lok Sabha, it can also be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.  Both Houses of Parliament have equal powers in the amendment process, reflecting the principle of bicameralism.  The statement incorrectly limits the initiation of the amendment process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some amendments require ratification by state legislatures (e.g., those affecting the federal structure), it's not necessarily *all* the states.  The requirement for state ratification varies depending on the specific nature of the amendment. The statement oversimplifies the complex process of constitutional amendment by requiring ratification by all state legislatures.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General can take part in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha.
2. The Attorney General has the right to vote in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India can take part in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and can speak in the Lok Sabha but not vote. This right allows the Attorney General to provide legal advice and representation to the government in parliamentary proceedings.  This role reflects the Attorney General's position as the government's chief legal advisor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General does not have the right to vote in the Lok Sabha. The Attorney General's role is advisory and representational, not directly participatory in the legislative process.  The statement incorrectly assigns voting rights to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is not an elected member of parliament.


**1. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to the Parliament.
2.  The Union Budget always includes provisions for both expenditure and receipts from all sources including the Consolidated Fund of India, Contingency Fund of India and Public Account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in the Union Budget process,  the Department of Expenditure is the nodal agency responsible for its preparation and presentation to Parliament. The Department of Revenue primarily deals with tax collection and administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Budget primarily deals with the Consolidated Fund of India, which is the primary source of government revenue and expenditure. While the Contingency Fund of India (for unforeseen emergencies) and the Public Account (for non-tax revenues and other funds) are also part of the overall government finances, they are not directly incorporated within the main budgetary framework in the same manner as the Consolidated Fund.  The Budget focuses on the planned expenditure and revenue estimates for the Consolidated Fund.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, characterized by a strong central government with significant powers over the states.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in the Indian Constitution is based on the scheme provided in the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian federal system is often described as quasi-federal or asymmetrical federalism because it leans towards a centralized structure. While there is a division of powers between the Centre and the States, the Constitution grants the Centre significant powers, including residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to either level of government), overriding power in case of conflict, and the power to impose President's rule in states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Government of India Act, 1935, did establish a federal structure with a division of powers, the current Indian Constitution is a distinct and independent document. The 1935 Act served as a partial influence but not the direct basis for the power distribution within the Indian Constitution. The current distribution is based on the drafting committee's vision for independent India and its specific needs.


**3. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a three-member body, consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the office of the President and Vice-President.  It also settles disputes related to the mergers or splits of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India can consist of one or more members, as determined by the President.  While it typically comprises a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, the exact number is not fixed constitutionally.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is the constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, the President, and the Vice-President.  It also has the power to settle disputes regarding the recognition of political parties, including mergers and splits.  Its independence and impartiality are crucial to the democratic process.


**4. With reference to the removal of the Chief Election Commissioner, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed from office by the President of India on the advice of the Council of Ministers, similar to the removal of other high-ranking officials.
2. The procedure for removing a Chief Election Commissioner is identical to the procedure for removing a judge of the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Chief Election Commissioner cannot be removed at the whim of the government.  While the President does have the power of removal, the process is more stringent and requires substantial grounds for removal,  not merely the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Commissioner's security of tenure is intended to safeguard their independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The procedure for removing a Chief Election Commissioner is not the same as that for a Supreme Court judge.  The removal of a Supreme Court Judge requires an impeachment process involving both houses of Parliament, while the removal of the Chief Election Commissioner is less clearly defined in the Constitution but involves a more significant process than simple executive dismissal.


**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and the State Governments and submits reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.
2. The CAG's reports are presented to the President of India who then lays them before the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG audits the accounts relating to the expenditure of the Union and State Governments.  The CAG submits its audit reports directly to the Parliament and the State Legislatures respectively, facilitating parliamentary oversight of public finances.  This is a crucial aspect of financial accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG submits its audit reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures directly, not to the President. The President does not have a direct role in presenting these reports to the legislative bodies. The reports are then examined by the Public Accounts Committees of the Parliament and State Legislatures.


**6. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years or earlier.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India constitutes the Finance Commission every five years, or earlier if needed, to review and recommend on the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and the States,  ensuring a fair and equitable allocation of funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments. The government can accept or reject the recommendations, but it must present its reasons for rejecting them to the Parliament. The recommendations, however, are usually accepted, given the expertise of the Commission and the importance of their work.


**7. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy and provide a social and economic base for the political democracy enshrined in Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable. Unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not directly enforceable in a court of law. They serve as guidelines for the government to frame its policies and legislation to achieve the social and economic goals outlined in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are intended to establish a welfare state, guiding the government towards achieving social and economic justice, equality, and better living standards for all citizens.  They are a crucial part of the Constitution's vision of a just and equitable society, complementing the Fundamental Rights.


**8.  With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Attorney General is a member of Parliament and has the right to vote in both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President and holds office during the President's pleasure. This means the President can remove the Attorney General at any time.  This arrangement ensures that the Attorney General serves the interests of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General is not a member of Parliament.  While the Attorney General has the right to speak and participate in parliamentary proceedings, they do not have the right to vote. This is to avoid conflict of interest and preserve their role as an independent legal advisor to the government.


**9. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governor of a State, and the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, usually on the advice of the Chief Minister. However, there are certain exceptional circumstances where the Governor may exercise this power independently, such as when the government loses its majority support or in other constitutional crises.


**10. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act made provisions for the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2. The Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 provided a constitutional basis for the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels, aiming to empower local self-governance.  While the specific structure may vary slightly across states, the three-tier system is the general principle.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and women in PRIs to ensure their representation and participation in local governance.  The proportion of reservation varies depending on the population of these groups in the respective areas.


**1. With reference to the features of the First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system, consider the following statements:**

1.  In FPTP, voters directly elect their representatives from a specific constituency, enabling them to hold their representatives personally accountable.
2.  FPTP systems are more likely to produce a stable government with a clear majority in the legislature compared to proportional representation (PR) systems.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FPTP system, unlike proportional representation (PR) systems, directly links a representative to a specific geographical constituency.  This direct accountability is a key feature of FPTP, allowing voters to directly influence their representative’s actions and hold them responsible for their performance. Voters know precisely who represents their interests and can directly engage with them on local issues.  This contrasts with PR systems where voters often select a party, and the allocation of seats based on party lists dilutes individual representative accountability to a specific constituency.

Statement 2 is also correct. FPTP systems generally tend to produce governments with a clear majority, especially in single-member constituencies.  The winner-takes-all nature of FPTP often results in one party or a coalition securing a significant number of seats, providing stability.  In contrast, PR systems frequently lead to coalition governments, which can be less stable due to the inherent complexities of managing multiple party interests and agendas. While coalition governments are not inherently unstable, FPTP offers a higher likelihood of a single-party majority government, enhancing governmental stability and policy coherence.  This stability is a significant consideration in the context of effective governance.


**2. With reference to the concerns surrounding the appointment of former Election Commissioners to political positions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Appointing former Election Commissioners to political positions could potentially compromise the impartiality and independence of the Election Commission.
2.  Former Election Commissioners, as citizens, have the right to join political parties and contest elections, irrespective of their previous roles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct, but represent opposing viewpoints on a complex issue.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a valid concern about maintaining the integrity and neutrality of the Election Commission.  The potential for conflict of interest arises if former commissioners, having intimate knowledge of election processes and inner workings, leverage this knowledge for political gain. This could erode public trust in the fairness and impartiality of future elections, undermining the democratic process.  The appearance of impropriety, even if no actual wrongdoing occurs, can be damaging to the institution's credibility.

Statement 2 also holds true.  Former Election Commissioners, upon leaving their positions, regain their rights as private citizens.  This includes the fundamental right to participate in the political process, including joining political parties and contesting elections.  However, the exercise of this right needs to be carefully considered in light of the potential conflicts of interest mentioned above.  A balance needs to be struck between upholding individual rights and safeguarding the integrity of critical democratic institutions.


**3. With reference to the arguments for and against shifting India's electoral system from First Past the Post (FPTP) to Proportional Representation (PR), consider the following statements:**

1.  A shift to PR would ensure a more precise reflection of the popular vote share in the allocation of legislative seats, eliminating discrepancies between votes and seats.
2.  The FPTP system, despite its limitations, encourages broader coalitions and alliances among diverse social groups, which is beneficial in a diverse country like India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Proportional representation systems aim to allocate legislative seats in direct proportion to the votes received by each party. This minimizes the discrepancies often seen in FPTP systems, where a party can win a disproportionately high number of seats compared to its overall vote share.  The argument for PR is that it provides fairer and more accurate representation of the electorate's preferences.  However, PR systems also have their own set of challenges, such as the potential for coalition instability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While FPTP does lead to disproportionate seat allocation, it also encourages parties to build broader coalitions to win elections.  In a diverse society like India, this can lead to greater inclusivity as parties strive to attract support from various social groups. This aspect of FPTP is often seen as a counterpoint to the argument for PR, which some argue might lead to the fragmentation of the political landscape and the emergence of numerous smaller parties representing narrow segments of the population, potentially hindering coalition building and governmental stability.  The debate between FPTP and PR hinges on balancing the need for proportional representation with the desire for governmental stability and the potential for broader social coalitions.


**4. With reference to the different types of executives, consider the following statements:**

1.  In a presidential system, the President is both the head of state and the head of government, wielding significant executive power.
2.  In a parliamentary system, the Prime Minister, as the head of government, wields effective executive power, while the President or Monarch serves primarily as a ceremonial head of state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of presidential systems.  The President is directly elected by the people and is not beholden to a legislature for their position.  They typically have significant powers to appoint officials, veto legislation, and command the armed forces.  The executive power is concentrated in the office of the President, unlike parliamentary systems where power is shared.  Examples include the United States, Brazil and many other countries.

Statement 2 is equally accurate in outlining the defining features of parliamentary systems.  In these systems, the head of state (a monarch or president) is largely ceremonial, while the real executive power resides with the Prime Minister and their cabinet.  The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party that commands a majority in the legislature, and they are accountable to the Parliament.  If they lose the confidence of the Parliament, they must resign.  The UK, Canada, India and many other countries operate under this model.  The distinction between these two systems is critical in understanding the balance of power within a nation's governance structure.


**5. With reference to the powers and functions of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister and other Ministers, and they hold office during the pleasure of the Governor.
2. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state, while largely a titular head, plays a crucial role in the formation of the state government.  They appoint the Chief Minister, typically the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislature.  The Governor also appoints other Ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister.  The phrase "during the pleasure of the Governor" signifies that the Ministers can be dismissed by the Governor, although in practice, this is done only if the Chief Minister advises the Governor to do so, losing the confidence of the assembly.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President of India.  This power is primarily used for bills that have significant implications for the Union government's policies or that raise constitutional issues.  The President can then either give assent to the bill or withhold assent, effectively vetoing it.  This power is a crucial check and balance mechanism to ensure that state legislation does not conflict with national interests.  The Governor's role, therefore, involves a careful balancing act between constitutional obligations and political realities.


**6.  With reference to the composition and functioning of the Council of Ministers at the Union level, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, and the Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers.
2. The President appoints the Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, and they hold office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core principle of collective responsibility in India's parliamentary system.  The entire Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.  This means that if the Lok Sabha expresses a lack of confidence in the government, the entire Council of Ministers must resign.  The Prime Minister, as the head of the government, plays a central role in this system, leading the Council and coordinating the work of various ministries.

Statement 2 also correctly describes the constitutional process of appointing Ministers at the Union level.  While the President formally appoints the Ministers, this appointment is entirely on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President, which essentially means they serve until the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, dismisses them.  This illustrates the formal role of the President and the real executive power vested in the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.  The interplay between these two elements is fundamental to the functioning of India's democratic system.


**7. With reference to the provisions related to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget must be presented in the Lok Sabha before it can be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill, but it can suggest amendments to the Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union Budget, which includes the Money Bill, is first presented in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.  This is a fundamental aspect of the financial procedure established in the Indian Constitution, reflecting the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling public expenditure.  The Budget must be passed by the Lok Sabha before it can be sent to the Rajya Sabha for consideration.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, has limited powers regarding Money Bills.  It cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only make recommendations or suggestions for amendments.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on whether to accept or reject these suggestions. This reflects the constitutional balance of power concerning financial matters, giving the Lok Sabha the ultimate authority over the nation's finances while allowing the Rajya Sabha a voice in the process.  This mechanism ensures both effective governance and legislative checks and balances.


**8.  With reference to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of certain other bodies.
2. The CAG is responsible for maintaining the accounts of the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India plays a crucial role in the nation's financial accountability.  Their primary function is to audit the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  This audit covers all receipts and expenditures of the government and ensures that public money is used efficiently and effectively, in accordance with the laws and regulations.  Beyond the governments, the CAG also audits the accounts of certain other bodies, such as autonomous institutions and public sector undertakings, as per specific provisions of the law.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CAG audits the accounts, they are not responsible for maintaining these accounts.  The responsibility for maintaining the accounts rests with the respective government departments and ministries.  The CAG's role is to independently examine these accounts to ensure their accuracy, legality, and compliance with financial regulations.  The distinction between auditing and maintaining accounts is critical in understanding the CAG's role as an independent watchdog overseeing public finances.  This separation ensures the integrity and objectivity of the audit process.


**9. With reference to the features of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution is a federal Constitution, but it leans towards a unitary system in times of national emergency.
2. The Indian Constitution incorporates both federal and unitary features, making it a quasi-federal system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's Constitution is a federal one, dividing powers between the Union and the States. However, it incorporates provisions that allow for a significant shift towards a unitary system during national emergencies.  Under Article 352, the President can declare a national emergency, which empowers the Union government to assume greater control over the States.  The federal structure is significantly altered during such periods, allowing the center to take over state functions.  This flexibility is a key element of the Constitution, reflecting its capacity to adapt to various circumstances.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Constitution is often described as a quasi-federal system because it blends features of both federal and unitary systems.  While it has a federal framework with a division of powers, the central government possesses significant powers, including the power to impose national emergencies, which can temporarily override the federal structure.  The presence of an integrated judiciary, All-India Services, and the centralizing tendency of the Constitution further contribute to its quasi-federal nature.  This unique blend ensures a balance between maintaining the federal structure while allowing for central control when necessary.  The quasi-federal nature is a key aspect of the Indian constitutional system.


**10. With reference to the composition of the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India consists of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.  It comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and a variable number of other Election Commissioners (ECs).  Currently, it comprises one CEC and two ECs. The number of ECs can be increased or decreased by the government, but the CEC always heads the commission.


Statement 2 is also correct. The President of India appoints the CEC and other ECs.  This is a crucial aspect of the ECI's independence, ensuring that appointments are not influenced by the political executive.  The appointments are made in accordance with the constitutional provisions aiming to maintain the neutrality and integrity of the election process.  The appointment process is vital for maintaining the credibility and authority of the ECI as an independent constitutional body.


**1. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to provinces.
2. It established a bicameral legislature at the center, comprising the Council of State and the Federal Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly altered the constitutional framework of British India.  Statement 1 is accurate; the Act introduced a system of provincial autonomy, granting substantial self-governing powers to the eleven provinces of British India.  Each province had its own elected legislature and a responsible government, accountable to the provincial assembly.  This marked a significant departure from the previous system of dyarchy, where power was divided between elected and nominated members of the executive council.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Act established a bicameral legislature at the center, a significant departure from the previous unicameral structure. The Council of State (Upper House) was largely nominated, while the Federal Legislative Assembly (Lower House) was largely elected, though with a complex system of representation that included separate electorates for certain communities. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key features of the 1935 Act.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the Act's provisions. Option (d) is entirely incorrect as both statements are factually correct.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable and cannot be enforced through judicial action.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution incorporates both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs).  Statement 1 is incorrect; DPSPs are *non-justiciable*, meaning they are not legally enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards social and economic justice, but their violation does not lead to direct legal consequences.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; Fundamental Rights are *justiciable*, meaning they are enforceable by courts of law.  Citizens can approach the courts to seek redressal if their Fundamental Rights are violated. The Supreme Court has played a crucial role in interpreting and expanding the scope of these rights. The distinction between justiciability and non-justiciability is a fundamental aspect of the Indian constitutional framework, reflecting the balance between individual rights and social goals. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly characterize the justiciability of either Fundamental Rights or Directive Principles.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, blending features of both federal and unitary systems.
2. The distribution of powers between the Union and States is based solely on the principles of federalism, with a clear division of responsibilities.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian federal structure is a unique blend of federal and unitary features, often described as a quasi-federal or asymmetrical federal system. Statement 1 accurately captures this nuanced reality. While the Constitution divides powers between the Union and States (through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List), it also grants the Union significant powers, including the power to legislate on matters in the State List in times of national emergency or national interest.  Furthermore, the Union's dominance in financial matters further reduces the States' autonomy.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the distribution of powers is not purely based on federal principles.  The Union's considerable powers, the presence of concurrent subjects, and provisions for Union intervention in State matters all showcase the unitary aspects of the Indian federal system.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, reflecting the complex and evolving nature of Indian federalism.


**4. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to introduce and pass Money Bills.
2.  The Lok Sabha alone has the power to vote on demands for grants.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament operates under a bicameral system, with the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to introduce Money Bills.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce Money Bills, reflecting its role as the primary body responsible for financial matters. The Rajya Sabha can, however, make recommendations to the Lok Sabha on Money Bills, but the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations.  Statement 2 is correct; the Lok Sabha holds the sole power to vote on demands for grants, which form part of the annual budget.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss and make recommendations on the budget, but it cannot vote on these demands. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters compared to the Rajya Sabha.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the respective roles of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the financial legislative process.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Judiciary:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in matters relating to disputes between the Union and the States.
2. High Courts in India have appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate courts within their respective states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian judicial system is hierarchical, with the Supreme Court at its apex.  Statement 1 is correct; the Supreme Court possesses original jurisdiction in certain specific cases, including disputes between the Government of India and one or more states, or disputes between two or more states. This original jurisdiction is explicitly provided for in the Constitution and is a crucial aspect of the Court's role in maintaining federal balance.  Statement 2 is also correct; High Courts in India have appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate courts (district courts, sessions courts, etc.) within their respective states. They can hear appeals against decisions of these lower courts.  This appellate function is a vital part of the High Court's role in ensuring fair and consistent application of the law.  Thus, both statements accurately describe key aspects of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and High Courts.


**6. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body, with a Chief Election Commissioner and several Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.  Statement 1 is largely correct; while it is primarily headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, the ECI can also comprise additional Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can be varied by the government, giving flexibility to the ECI's structure depending on the scale of the electoral exercise.  Statement 2 is also correct; the ECI is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), State Legislative Assemblies, and the President of India. It also plays a crucial role in resolving election-related disputes and ensuring the adherence to the Model Code of Conduct.  Therefore, both statements are accurate representations of the ECI's structure and functions.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor is the head of the State executive, appointed by the President of India.  Statement 1 is correct; the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can remove the Governor at any time. Although this power is rarely exercised, it highlights the ultimate authority of the President over the States.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, but this power is typically exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister.  The Chief Minister advises the Governor on this matter, reflecting the principle of responsible government at the State level.  While the Governor has certain discretionary powers, the advice of the Chief Minister normally prevails in such decisions. Thus, both statements accurately reflect the position and powers of the Governor.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President of India, who then presents them to the Parliament.
2. The CAG is appointed by the Parliament for a fixed term and can be removed only through impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  Statement 1 is correct; the CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then lays them before the Parliament.  This ensures that the Parliament is informed about the financial management of the government. The reports of the CAG are crucial for parliamentary oversight and accountability.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the CAG is appointed by the President, not the Parliament, and can be removed from office by the President only on grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity.  The process is similar to that for removing a Supreme Court judge.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all States.
2.  Gram Sabhas are statutory bodies with specific powers and functions as defined by the 73rd Amendment Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 aimed to strengthen and institutionalize Panchayati Raj institutions in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Act seeks to establish Panchayati Raj institutions, it doesn't mandate a uniform three-tier system across all states.  The specific structure of Panchayati Raj is left to the discretion of individual states, considering their geographical and demographic variations.  Statement 2 is correct; the 73rd Amendment Act legally recognizes and empowers Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) as institutions of local self-governance.  They are given specific roles in planning and development at the village level. This recognition of Gram Sabhas is a key aspect of the Act's attempt to empower local communities.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC has the power to initiate suo moto inquiries into human rights violations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC is a statutory body, established through an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect; the NHRC's existence and powers are defined by legislation, not the Constitution itself.  While the Constitution emphasizes the protection of human rights, it does not specifically create the NHRC.  Statement 2 is correct; the NHRC has the power to take suo moto cognizance of human rights violations.  It can initiate investigations on its own, without needing a formal complaint. This power is crucial to the NHRC's effectiveness in addressing human rights issues.  Thus, only statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC's powers and functions are elaborated in the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.


**1. With reference to the National Social Assistance Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The programme primarily fulfills the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of India.
2.  The programme significantly contributes to the Directive Principles of State Policy, aiming for social justice and welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at providing social security and safety net to vulnerable groups. While it indirectly supports the overall goal of a just society (related to Fundamental Rights), its core function lies in fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy. The NSAP directly addresses the welfare needs of the elderly, widows, and disabled, aligning with the constitutional mandate for social justice and welfare.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the NSAP's impact on Fundamental Rights is indirect and not its primary objective.  The programme doesn't directly enforce or guarantee specific Fundamental Rights.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court of India's advisory role, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can offer advice to the President on any matter of significant public interest, even without a formal request.
2. The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction is limited to matters concerning the Fundamental Rights of citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India possesses advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 of the Constitution.  While the President can seek advice on any matter, the Court also possesses the power to offer advice *suo moto* on matters of significant public interest.  This is a crucial aspect of its role in upholding the Constitution and safeguarding the nation's interests.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect as the Court's advisory powers are not restricted to Fundamental Rights issues; they extend to a broader range of matters deemed important by the Court or referred by the President.


**3. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats primarily focus on pre-litigative matters and cannot handle cases already pending in courts.
2. Lok Adalats can only address civil disputes and lack jurisdiction over criminal cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lok Adalats are informal dispute resolution mechanisms designed to provide speedy and cost-effective justice.  While they are effective in settling pre-litigative disputes, they also have the power to resolve cases already filed in courts if the parties agree to refer them to a Lok Adalat. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct as Lok Adalats primarily deal with civil matters,  though some states have experimented with incorporating certain types of minor criminal offences.  However, their primary focus and established jurisdiction remain within the realm of civil disputes.


**4. With reference to the "Instrument of Instructions" from the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Instrument of Instructions" were directly incorporated into the Fundamental Rights of the 1950 Constitution.
2. The principles outlined in the "Instrument of Instructions" influenced the Directive Principles of State Policy in the 1950 Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 included "Instrument of Instructions" that provided guidelines for the Governor-General and Governors on matters of governance. These instructions were not directly incorporated as Fundamental Rights in the 1950 Constitution.  However, the spirit and several principles of the "Instrument of Instructions," particularly those related to social and economic welfare, significantly influenced the framing of the Directive Principles of State Policy.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct, while statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles reflect a commitment to social justice and welfare, mirroring some of the concerns addressed in the 1935 Act's instructions.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is responsible for presenting the Finance Commission's recommendations to Parliament.
2. The Union Finance Minister is responsible for the presentation of the Union Budget to the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission submits its recommendations to the President, who then presents them to both Houses of Parliament.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Finance Minister holds the responsibility for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to Parliament, reflecting the executive branch's role in budgetary matters. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The Finance Commission's recommendations inform the Budget, but the presentation is the responsibility of the Finance Minister.


**6.  With reference to the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, consider the following statements:**

1. This policy exclusively applies to individuals displaced due to land acquisition for projects.
2. The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for formulating this policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, aims to provide rehabilitation and resettlement for individuals displaced due to various reasons, including but not limited to land acquisition for projects.  Involuntary displacement due to other reasons like natural disasters or developmental projects also falls under its purview. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ministry of Rural Development is not solely responsible for the policy's formulation; it's a collaborative effort involving multiple ministries, including the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  The policy's broad scope and multi-ministerial involvement make both statements inaccurate.


**7. With reference to the Consumer Disputes Redressal mechanism at the district level, consider the following statements:**

1.  A State Government can establish only one District Forum per district.
2. The District Forum handles complaints where the value of goods or services exceeds ₹50 lakhs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

State Governments have the authority to establish more than one District Forum in a district if needed to ensure efficient consumer redressal. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect. The District Forum's jurisdiction is limited to complaints where the value of goods or services does not exceed ₹50 lakhs.  Complaints exceeding this amount fall under the jurisdiction of the State Commission or National Commission. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  Both statements misrepresent the actual functioning and jurisdiction of District Forums.


**8. With reference to the State Finance Commission's role, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Finance Commission recommends principles for determining taxes that can be appropriated by Panchayats.
2. District Planning Committees determine the principles for Panchayat taxation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The State Finance Commission plays a crucial role in the financial health of Panchayats at the state level.  It is mandated to recommend principles for determining taxes and duties that can be appropriated by Panchayats in a specific state.  This is a key aspect of empowering local governance.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  District Planning Committees are involved in planning and development but do not have the authority to determine principles for Panchayat taxation; that responsibility rests with the State Finance Commission.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.


**9. With reference to taxes on Stock Exchanges and Futures Markets in India, consider the following statements:**

1. These taxes are levied by the Union Government.
2. These taxes are collected by the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Taxes on transactions in Stock Exchanges and Futures Markets are primarily levied by the Union Government, reflecting the national scope of these markets.  While the collection might involve collaboration between the Union and State Governments, the primary levying authority is the Union.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect as these taxes are not directly collected by State Governments.  The Union Government retains the primary authority for levying and largely managing these taxes.


**10. With reference to the Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act, 1992, consider the following statements:**

1. This act mandates the establishment of District Planning Committees.
2. It establishes State Election Commissions to conduct all panchayat elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act aims at strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions and promoting decentralized governance.  It mandates the constitution of District Planning Committees to involve local bodies in development planning.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The act also provides for the establishment of State Election Commissions to conduct panchayat elections, ensuring free and fair elections at the local level.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Both statements accurately reflect key provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act.


**11. With reference to the benefits available to persons with disabilities under Indian law, consider the following statements:**

1.  Free schooling is guaranteed until the age of 18 in government-run schools.
2. Preferential allotment of land for setting up businesses is a mandatory provision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates free education for persons with disabilities up to the age of 18 in government-run schools.  This is a crucial provision for ensuring equal opportunities.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  While preferential allotment of land for businesses might be encouraged by certain policies, it's not a mandatory legal provision under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The focus is on inclusive education and other forms of support, not necessarily land allocation.


**12. With reference to the authorization for withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India must authorize all withdrawals.
2. The Parliament of India must authorize all withdrawals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India vests the power to authorize withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India with the Parliament.  The President's role is primarily ceremonial; the Parliament's approval is essential for any expenditure. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because while the President is the nominal head, the actual authority rests with the Parliament, which approves the budget and thus authorizes the withdrawals.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, which is accountable to Parliament.


**13. With reference to the "Look East Policy" of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy aims to establish India as a major player in East Asian affairs.
2. The policy seeks to revive historical and cultural ties with Southeast and East Asian nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's "Look East Policy," later renamed "Act East Policy," is a strategic initiative to strengthen relations with countries in Southeast and East Asia.  It aims to enhance India's regional influence and establish stronger economic and diplomatic ties.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The policy also emphasizes the revival of historical and cultural links with these nations, recognizing the shared heritage and cultural exchanges.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Both statements accurately capture the core objectives and strategic goals of the policy.


**14. With reference to the consequences of the failure of the Union Budget to pass the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Finance Minister is required to resign.
2. The Council of Ministers must submit its resignation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The failure of the Union Budget to pass the Lok Sabha constitutes a vote of no confidence in the government.  This triggers a constitutional crisis, requiring the Council of Ministers to resign.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Minister's position is significantly impacted, their resignation is not automatically mandated. The entire Council of Ministers bears collective responsibility for the budget's failure.  The Prime Minister, along with the entire Council, is expected to resign.


**15. With reference to Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abiding by the Constitution and respecting its ideals is a Fundamental Duty.
2. Voting in public elections is a Fundamental Duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are outlined in Part IV-A of the Constitution.  They are moral obligations on citizens, not legally enforceable rights.  Abiding by the Constitution and respecting its ideals is explicitly listed as a Fundamental Duty. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Voting in public elections is not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Duty; it is a civic responsibility, but not a constitutionally mandated duty.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The focus of Fundamental Duties is on civic virtue and national unity, not specific electoral participation.


**16. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's primary role is to encourage foreign capital inflow for infrastructure development.
2. The Finance Commission ensures transparency in financial administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's mandate is to review the financial resources of the Union and States and recommend the distribution of tax proceeds and grants-in-aid.  It doesn't directly deal with attracting foreign investment for infrastructure.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. While the Commission's work indirectly promotes financial transparency through its recommendations, its primary focus is not on direct oversight or enforcement of transparency measures.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Commission's role is primarily advisory and focused on fiscal federalism.


**17. With reference to Human Rights under the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," consider the following statements:**

1. The right to education is a recognized human right.
2. The right to equal access to public service is a recognized human right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recognizes a broad range of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. The right to education is explicitly mentioned in the UDHR, emphasizing its importance for individual development and societal progress. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The right to equal access to public service, while not explicitly stated in the same way as the right to education, is implicit in the principles of equality and non-discrimination that underpin the UDHR.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Both rights align with the broader principles of dignity, freedom, and equality enshrined in the UDHR.


**18. With reference to Metropolitan Planning Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Metropolitan Planning Committees are established under the provisions of the Constitution of India.
2.  Metropolitan Planning Committees solely manage government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Metropolitan Planning Committees are established through legislation, not directly by constitutional provisions.  While the 74th Amendment Act provides a framework for urban local governance, it does not specifically mention Metropolitan Planning Committees.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Metropolitan Planning Committees prepare development plans and coordinate with various agencies, but they do not have sole responsibility for implementing all government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  Multiple agencies and levels of government are involved in urban development projects.


**19. With reference to the difference between a "vote-on-account" and an "interim budget," consider the following statements:**

1. A "vote-on-account" is used by a regular government, while an "interim budget" is used by a caretaker government.
2. A "vote-on-account" only deals with expenditure, while an "interim budget" includes both expenditure and receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A "vote-on-account" is a short-term measure allowing the government to spend money for a limited period, usually a few months, while the regular budget is being prepared.  It does not necessarily imply that the government is a caretaker government. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect.  An "interim budget" is also a short-term measure, but it covers both expenditure and receipts, providing a complete financial framework for a limited period. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The key difference lies in the comprehensiveness of the financial provisions.


**20. With reference to the distribution of powers between the Centre and States in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme is based on the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909.
2. The scheme is based on the Government of India Act of 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The distribution of powers between the Centre and States in the Indian Constitution is fundamentally based on the Government of India Act of 1935.  This Act established a federal structure with a division of powers between the federal and provincial governments, which significantly influenced the structure of the Indian Constitution. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 introduced some elements of representation but did not establish a comprehensive federal structure like the 1935 Act.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.


**21. With reference to the role and powers of the Gram Sabha under the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Sabhas have the power to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.
2. Gram Sabhas have ownership of minor forest produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, grants significant powers to Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.  Gram Sabhas have the power to prevent the alienation of land and protect the rights of tribal communities. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Act also recognizes the Gram Sabha's role in managing and protecting minor forest produce, giving them a significant stake in forest resources.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Both statements accurately reflect the empowerment of Gram Sabhas under this Act.


**22. With reference to the purpose of an adjournment motion in the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. It facilitates a discussion on a matter of urgent public importance.
2. It allows opposition members to gather information from ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

An adjournment motion is a parliamentary procedure used to interrupt the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.  It allows for immediate attention to pressing issues. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  While an adjournment motion might indirectly lead to information gathering by opposition members, its primary purpose is not information gathering; it is to disrupt normal proceedings to address an urgent issue.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The motion's focus is on immediate debate and action, not information collection.


**23. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act is based on the Right to a healthy environment, construed as part of the Right to Life under Article 21.
2. The Act is based on the provisions regarding grants for Scheduled Areas' administration under Article 275(1).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted to provide a specialized mechanism for addressing environmental issues and reducing the burden on higher courts.  The Act is fundamentally linked to the Right to Life under Article 21, which has been interpreted to include the right to a healthy environment.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Act is not directly based on the provisions of Article 275(1), which deals with grants for Scheduled Areas' administration.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The Tribunal's focus is environmental justice and not specifically related to Scheduled Areas' administration.


**24. With reference to the concept of "vote-on-account", consider the following statements:**

1. A vote-on-account is used only when a government is in its final stages before an election.
2. A vote-on-account is a temporary measure providing for government spending until a full budget is passed.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A vote-on-account is a parliamentary device used to provide for government spending for a limited period, typically a few months, when the regular budget has not yet been passed.  It is not exclusively associated with caretaker governments or governments nearing an election.  Thus, statement 1 is incorrect.  Its primary purpose is to ensure the government can continue functioning and meet essential expenditure needs while the regular budget is being finalized.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The vote-on-account is a temporary financial arrangement to bridge the gap until a full budget is in place.


**25. Consider the following statements about the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament before funds can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha, and only after its passage does it go to the Rajya Sabha. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Budget, particularly money bills, must receive the assent of both Houses before funds can be legally withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.  This is a crucial safeguard against unauthorized spending.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The Lok Sabha's primary role in budgetary matters reflects its position as the House of the people.


**26.  With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India appoints the Chairperson of the Commission.
2. The Commission's recommendations are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) is a constitutional body established to investigate and recommend measures related to the welfare of backward classes.  The President of India appoints the Chairperson and other members of the NCBC.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, the Commission's recommendations are not binding on the government; they are advisory in nature. The government considers the recommendations, but it is not obligated to accept them. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The advisory nature of the recommendations allows for flexibility while ensuring that the Commission's expertise is taken into account.


**27. With reference to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Officer is appointed by the Lok Sabha Speaker.
2. The Special Officer investigates matters relating to safeguards for linguistic minorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution mandates a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, appointed by the President of India, to investigate matters concerning the safeguards provided to linguistic minorities under the Constitution. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as the appointment is made by the President, not the Lok Sabha Speaker.  The President's role reflects the importance of this office in upholding constitutional guarantees.


**28. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the Prime Minister of India.
2. The CAG can be removed from office only by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  The President's role reflects the independence and high stature of this office. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG enjoys security of tenure and can be removed from office only through a special process involving a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament, mirroring the removal process for Supreme Court judges.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The removal process safeguards the CAG's independence.


**29. Consider the following statements regarding the establishment of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1. The CBI was established through an Act of Parliament.
2. The Santhanam Committee recommended the establishment of the CBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CBI was initially established through a resolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs, not an Act of Parliament.  It later became an attached office under the Ministry of Personnel.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption (1962-64) recommended the establishment of a central investigative agency, which led to the creation of the CBI.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The Committee's recommendation highlights the need for a strong, independent agency to combat corruption.


**30. With reference to the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act protects the identity of whistle-blowers who expose corruption.
2. The Act mandates punishment for all complaints, regardless of their validity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014, aims to protect individuals who expose corruption and irregularities within the government.  A key feature is the protection of whistle-blowers' identities to prevent victimization.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Act does not mandate punishment for all complaints; it focuses on punishing false or frivolous complaints to prevent misuse of the system.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act balances the need to protect whistle-blowers with the need to prevent malicious accusations.


**31.  Consider the following statements about the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC):**

1. The CVC is a constitutional body.
2. The CVC's jurisdiction extends to all levels of government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CVC is not a constitutional body; it was established through an executive resolution.  Its existence is not directly mandated by the Constitution. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The CVC's jurisdiction primarily extends to the central government and certain public sector undertakings; it does not encompass all levels of government.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  Its scope is defined by the CVC Act, 2003, and subsequent amendments.


**32. With reference to the Estimates Committee of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee examines the government's past performance in implementing programs.
2. The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to improve efficiency and economy in administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Estimates Committee is a parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the government's budget and expenditure proposals.  It primarily focuses on future estimates and does not directly examine past performance, although past performance might inform its assessment of future proposals.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Committee has the power to suggest alternative policies to improve efficiency and economy, playing a crucial role in ensuring responsible government spending.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The Committee's work is forward-looking, focusing on optimizing future resource allocation.


**33. With reference to the expenditure "charged" on the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. This expenditure is subject to the vote of Parliament.
2. This expenditure is in the nature of obligatory payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Expenditure "charged" on the Consolidated Fund of India does not require the approval of Parliament through the voting process.  It represents payments mandated by the Constitution or laws, such as the salaries of the President, Supreme Court judges, and CAG.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  This expenditure is in the nature of obligatory payments, representing commitments the government must meet regardless of the annual budget's overall status.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The "charged" expenditure is a separate category reflecting constitutional and legal obligations.


**34. Consider the following statements about the President's ordinance-making power:**

1. This power is co-extensive with the legislative power of Parliament.
2. Ordinances can be withdrawn at any time by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President's ordinance-making power, under Article 123, allows for the promulgation of ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  This power is essentially equivalent to the legislative power of Parliament on the same subject matter. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The President also retains the power to withdraw an ordinance at any time, even before it is laid before Parliament. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  This power is a crucial safeguard, allowing for immediate action in times of emergency or urgent need, but also retains flexibility for correction or withdrawal.


**35. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced provincial autonomy.
2. It abolished dyarchy in the provinces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced significant changes in the governance structure of India.  A key feature was the introduction of provincial autonomy, granting greater self-governance to provinces. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Act also abolished dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces, replacing it with a more unified system of provincial administration.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  These changes reflected a shift towards greater self-governance and a more streamlined administrative system.


**36. With reference to the determination of the form in which the accounts of the Union and States are kept, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Minister of India, in consultation with the CAG, determines the form.
2. The CAG, with the approval of the President, determines the form.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution mandates that the accounts of the Union and States shall be kept in a form prescribed by the CAG, with the President's approval. This ensures uniformity and adherence to constitutional standards. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The Finance Minister's role is primarily related to budgetary matters, not the specific form in which accounts are maintained.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's role in this matter reflects their responsibility for auditing and maintaining financial integrity.


**37. With reference to the Indian Councils Act that introduced the principle of election, consider the following statements:**

1. It was the Indian Councils Act of 1861.
2. It was the Indian Councils Act of 1892.

Which of the statements given above is/are

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council (NDC) was a constitutional body established under Article 263 of the Indian Constitution.
2.  Before 1967, the NDC's membership comprised only selected cabinet ministers, excluding other significant government officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) was not a constitutional body. It was a forum for cooperative federalism, established by a government resolution, not a constitutional provision.  Article 263 pertains to the establishment of Inter-State Councils, not the NDC. The Sarkaria Commission did recommend giving the NDC constitutional status under Article 263 and renaming it, but this recommendation was never implemented.

Statement 2 is correct.  Prior to 1967, the NDC's membership was limited to selected cabinet ministers such as those from the Home, Finance, Defence, and External Affairs ministries.  This was a deliberate strategy to ensure high-level political involvement in planning. The inclusion of other officials broadened its scope later.


**2. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. The NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015, inheriting all its powers and functions.
2. The NITI Aayog council was recommended by the Sarkaria Commission to be given constitutional status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015, it did not inherit *all* its powers and functions.  The NITI Aayog operates with a different structure and focus, emphasizing cooperative federalism and a more collaborative approach to policy-making compared to the centralized planning approach of the Planning Commission.  The transfer of power was not absolute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sarkaria Commission recommended that the *National Development Council* (NDC), not the NITI Aayog, should be given constitutional status under Article 263.  The NITI Aayog was a later creation and its formation was not a direct outcome of the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations.


**3. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established to safeguard human rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
2. The Chairperson of the NHRC must be a retired Chief Justice of India, and members must include serving or retired Supreme Court judges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and not through a constitutional amendment.  While it works to protect human rights guaranteed by the Constitution, its legal basis is an Act of Parliament.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Chairperson of the NHRC should be a retired Chief Justice of India or a retired Supreme Court judge (as per the 2019 amendment), the membership criteria include a serving or retired judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court, along with other persons having expertise in human rights.  The statement oversimplifies the diverse composition of the commission.


**4. With reference to the composition of the NHRC, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NHRC based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the President of India.
2.  Ex-officio members of the NHRC include the Chairpersons of the National Commission for Minorities, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes, but not the National Commission for Women.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NHRC, but the recommendations come from a six-member committee headed by the Prime Minister, not the President. This committee also includes the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and leaders of the opposition from both houses, along with the Home Minister.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The list of ex-officio members of the NHRC is broader than what the statement suggests. As per the 2019 amendment, it includes the Chairpersons of the National Commission for Minorities, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Backward Classes, and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, along with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities.


**5. With reference to the powers and functions of the State Information Commission (SIC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SIC can only inquire into complaints related to the denial of information requests, not other matters concerning the Right to Information Act, 2005.
2. The SIC possesses the powers of a civil court, including summoning witnesses and demanding documents, but cannot impose penalties on errant officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SIC's jurisdiction extends beyond the simple denial of information requests. It can also investigate complaints about unreasonable fees, incomplete or misleading information, and other issues related to accessing information under the RTI Act.  Its role is broader than simply resolving disputes over denied requests.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SIC does possess the powers of a civil court, including summoning witnesses and demanding documents.  Importantly, it *can* also impose penalties (such as a daily fine) on Public Information Officers who fail to comply with the Act.  This is a crucial aspect of its enforcement powers.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the removal of the Chairperson or a member of the State Information Commission:**

1. The Governor can remove a member of the SIC only after obtaining the consent of the State Legislature.
2. Grounds for removal include insolvency, conviction for an offense involving moral turpitude, and engaging in paid employment outside official duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor can remove the Chairperson or a member of the SIC without the explicit consent of the State Legislature.  While the Governor's actions are subject to constitutional checks and balances, the Legislature's direct consent is not required for removal.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor can remove a member of the SIC based on grounds such as insolvency, a conviction for an offense involving moral turpitude, engaging in paid employment outside official duties,  unfitness due to mental or physical infirmity, or acquiring financial interests that could prejudice official functions.  Proved misbehaviour or incapacity are also grounds for removal, subject to a Supreme Court inquiry.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 60, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG can be removed from office by the President on the same grounds and in the same manner as a judge of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President for a term of six years or until the age of 65, not 60, whichever is earlier.  The age limit is consistent with the high standards of experience and independence expected of this crucial constitutional office.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution ensures the CAG's independence by providing that removal can only be done by the President on the same grounds and procedure as for a Supreme Court judge, requiring a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament with special majorities for proved misbehaviour or incapacity. This safeguard protects the CAG from political interference.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is consulted on all matters relating to the methods of recruitment to civil services, but not on matters related to promotions and transfers.
2. The UPSC's recommendations are binding on the Government of India, and the government cannot reject them without a valid reason.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC is consulted not only on recruitment methods but also on a wide range of personnel management matters, including promotions, transfers, disciplinary actions, and pension claims. Its advisory role is comprehensive, covering the entire spectrum of civil service administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UPSC's recommendations are *advisory*, not binding on the government.  While the government is accountable to Parliament for rejecting UPSC advice, the recommendations themselves do not have the force of law.  The government can reject the advice, but it must justify its decision to Parliament.


**9. With reference to the State Public Service Commission (SPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SPSC is constituted by the President of India on the recommendation of the Governor of the respective state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

1. The Finance Commission submits its report to the Parliament, which then decides on the distribution of tax revenues between the Centre and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission submits its report to the *President* of India, who then presents it to the Parliament. The Parliament's role is to consider the report and the government's response, but the Commission itself does not directly report to the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recommendations of the Finance Commission are *advisory*, not binding on the Central Government.  While the government generally takes its recommendations seriously, it is not legally obligated to accept them.  This reflects the balance of power between the Centre and the States in fiscal matters.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Union Finance Minister acts as the ex-officio Secretary to the GST Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Constitution, introduced through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016. Its formation reflects the importance of cooperative federalism in tax administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Revenue Secretary, not the Union Finance Minister, acts as the ex-officio Secretary to the GST Council.  The Revenue Secretary's role is to provide administrative and secretarial support to the Council's functioning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCBC, previously a statutory body, gained constitutional status through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018. This amendment inserted Article 338B in the Constitution, providing constitutional backing and strengthening the commission's position.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCBC's key functions include investigating matters related to the constitutional safeguards for socially and educationally backward classes and submitting reports to the President. These reports are then laid before Parliament, ensuring transparency and accountability.


**13. With reference to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the Parliament, based on the recommendations of the Ministry of Minority Affairs.
2. The Special Officer's primary duty is to investigate matters relating to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the Constitution and report to the President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities (now designated as Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities) is appointed by the *President* of India, not the Parliament.  While the Ministry of Minority Affairs plays a role in the process, the ultimate appointing authority is the President.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core function of the Special Officer/Commissioner is to investigate matters related to the safeguards for linguistic minorities under the Constitution and report to the President. These reports are then presented to Parliament.  This ensures that the constitutional rights of linguistic minorities are monitored and addressed.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council (NDC) was established under Article 263 of the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a constitutional body; it was established by a resolution of the government in 1952.  Article 263 pertains to the establishment of an Inter-State Council, a completely different entity.  The NDC's composition and functions are not constitutionally mandated.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sarkaria Commission, appointed to examine Centre-State relations, did indeed recommend that the NDC be given constitutional status under Article 263 and be renamed the National Economic and Development Council. This recommendation, however, was not implemented.  The NDC was eventually replaced by NITI Aayog.


**2. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC was established through a constitutional amendment in 1993.
2. The chairperson of the NHRC must be a retired Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body established through a constitutional amendment.  The Constitution does not explicitly create the NHRC.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 mandates that the chairperson of the NHRC should be a retired Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court.


**3. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCST's recommendations are binding on the government.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCST, like other similar commissions, has primarily recommendatory powers. Its recommendations are not legally binding on the government, although they carry significant weight and influence.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 338A of the Constitution of India deals with the establishment of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister's National Relief Fund is operated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) is operated by the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NDMA plays a crucial role in disaster management, the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, is primarily implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development. The NDMA's role is more focused on disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCBC is a statutory body established by the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993 (later repealed and re-established).  Its establishment did not involve a constitutional amendment.  The 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018,  introduced Article 342A, which deals with the power of the President to specify Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs). However, this did not directly establish the NCBC constitutionally.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCBC submits its annual and other reports to the President, who then presents them to the Parliament.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential, they are not legally binding on the Central and State Governments.  The government can choose to accept or reject them, but it must explain its reasons for doing so.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Finance Commission, usually for a five-year term.


**14. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

**15. Consider the following statements:**

2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**1. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of the NITI Aayog.
2.  The NITI Aayog was established through a Constitutional amendment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Prime Minister of India holds the position of Chairperson of the NITI Aayog. This is explicitly mentioned in the text describing the composition of the NITI Aayog.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NITI Aayog was not established through a Constitutional amendment.  It was established by an executive resolution of the Government of India, replacing the Planning Commission.  This signifies its non-constitutional and non-statutory nature.  Constitutional bodies are created by the Constitution itself, while statutory bodies are established by an Act of Parliament.  The NITI Aayog falls outside both categories.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Inter-State Council:**

1. The Inter-State Council is a Constitutional body established under Article 263.
2.  The primary function of the Inter-State Council is to adjudicate inter-state water disputes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is correct. The Inter-State Council is indeed a Constitutional body, its establishment being mandated by Article 263 of the Indian Constitution. This article empowers the President to establish such a council to promote coordination between the Union and the States, and among the States themselves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Inter-State Council plays a vital role in resolving inter-state disputes, its primary function is not limited to adjudicating water disputes.  The adjudication of water disputes is handled by specific tribunals established under the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956.  The Inter-State Council's role is broader, encompassing the promotion of cooperation and coordination on various matters of common interest between the Union and States and among States.


**3. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor has the power to dismiss a Chief Minister even without the advice of the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Governor typically acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, there are certain situations where they can exercise discretionary powers. Dismissing a Chief Minister who has lost the confidence of the Legislative Assembly is one such instance.  The text highlights that the Governor's discretion is limited and must be exercised reasonably and in good faith, but the power itself exists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sarkaria Commission recommended a five-year fixed tenure for Governors, this is not a constitutional mandate. The Governor's tenure is at the pleasure of the President, meaning they can be removed before the completion of five years.  The text explicitly mentions that the Governor's removal should not be at the "sweet will" of the Central Government, but it doesn't guarantee a fixed five-year term.


**4. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted every five years.
2. The recommendations of the Finance Commission are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission is a constitutional body established under Article 280, and it is constituted every five years to review the financial relations between the Union and the States.  The text does not provide a specific timeframe but mentions the Finance Commission's recommendations, indicating its periodic constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission are advisory in nature. While they carry significant weight and are generally followed, they are not legally binding on the Union or State Governments.  The Government can choose to accept or reject the recommendations, but it's expected that it provides justifications for any deviations.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG's reports are tabled in both Houses of Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG, a crucial pillar of India's financial accountability system, is appointed by the President of India. This method of appointment ensures a degree of independence from the executive branch.

Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG's reports, which are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances, are presented to both Houses of Parliament. This allows for scrutiny and debate on the government's financial management.  The process ensures transparency and accountability.


**6. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Department of Revenue.
2.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in tax collection and revenue management, the Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Department of Expenditure (Ministry of Finance).

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution explicitly mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This safeguard prevents the executive from spending public money without legislative approval, ensuring financial accountability.


**7. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Parliament, does not possess the power to reject a Money Bill.  A Money Bill, dealing primarily with financial matters, is passed by the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and sent to the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha within 14 days; the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments to a Money Bill, it cannot actually amend the Bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say in the matter, and it can choose to accept or reject the recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the State to frame policies that promote social and economic justice.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are designed to guide the State in establishing a welfare state and achieving socio-economic democracy. They aim to create a society where social and economic inequalities are minimized, and the welfare of citizens is prioritized.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Equality includes the abolition of untouchability.
2.  The Right to Freedom includes the right to form associations or unions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Equality, enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution, explicitly includes the abolition of untouchability.  Untouchability is a form of social discrimination that is outlawed under this right.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Right to Freedom, another crucial Fundamental Right, includes the freedom of association or union. This allows citizens to form groups, organizations, and unions to pursue their collective interests.


**10. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Election Commission of India functions with a Chief Election Commissioner, it is not a single-member body.  It also includes regional election commissioners, whose number can be varied by the government, to ensure effective conduct of elections across the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is the constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislative Assemblies, and other bodies as mandated by law.  The Commission's independence and impartiality are crucial for the functioning of India's democracy.


**1. With reference to the recommendations of the Ashok Mehta Committee on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  It advocated for a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  It recommended the mandatory reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population in the Panchayati Raj institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ashok Mehta Committee, appointed in 1977, significantly shaped the understanding and structure of Panchayati Raj.  While the committee did emphasize the importance of a multi-tiered system, its recommendation was for a *two-tier* system, encompassing village and intermediate levels, with the district level playing a coordinating role, not a full-fledged tier with independent powers.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Crucially, the committee strongly advocated for reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayati Raj institutions, proportional to their population. This was a key recommendation aimed at ensuring social justice and inclusivity within the system.  Statement 2 is thus correct.  The committee's report, while not directly resulting in immediate nationwide implementation, influenced subsequent policy changes related to reservations and organizational structures in Panchayati Raj.  The focus on a two-tiered system, however, contrasted with the three-tier model later adopted in many states.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to the Parliament.
2.  The Parliament's authorization is mandatory for the withdrawal of funds from both the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in the Union Budget process, it is not solely responsible for its preparation and presentation.  The entire process involves multiple departments and ministries, with the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Expenditure also significantly contributing to the budget's formulation. The Finance Minister, ultimately, presents the budget to Parliament. Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution explicitly mandates parliamentary authorization for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India (Article 265).  While the Public Account is not subject to the same strict parliamentary control as the Consolidated Fund,  it is still subject to parliamentary scrutiny and authorization for certain types of withdrawals. The distinction between the two accounts and the degree of parliamentary control over the Public Account has been a subject of debate and interpretation.


**3. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's primary function is to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.
2. The Finance Commission is mandated to review and evaluate the financial performance of Public Sector Undertakings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Commission, established under Article 280 of the Constitution, plays a pivotal role in India's federal financial architecture. Its core mandate is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States, and the grants-in-aid from the Union to the States.  The Commission's recommendations significantly influence the financial autonomy and capabilities of State governments. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's purview does not extend to reviewing or evaluating the financial performance of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).  The review and evaluation of PSUs falls under the domain of other government bodies and agencies, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) and various ministries. The Finance Commission's focus remains on the broader fiscal relations between the Union and the States, ensuring equitable resource allocation.


**4. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of all ministries and departments of the Union Government, but not those of the State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the CAG is appointed by the President of India, the CAG holds office for a fixed term (six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier) and cannot be removed except through impeachment by Parliament.  The Constitution guarantees the CAG's independence and security of tenure. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's audit function extends to the accounts of both the Union and the State Governments.  The CAG's reports on the accounts of both levels of government are crucial for maintaining financial accountability and transparency.  The CAG's independence and authority are vital for upholding financial probity in the Indian administrative system.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India, but not to local bodies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Election Commission can have up to three members (including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners), currently it functions as a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  The composition can be changed by the government. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission's responsibilities encompass conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, President, Vice-President, and also to local bodies (although the specifics of conducting local body elections may vary from state to state).  The Commission's role is central to India's democratic process, ensuring free and fair elections at all levels.


**6. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgments.
2. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is limited to matters involving disputes between the Union and the States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court possesses the power of judicial review, including the ability to review its own previous judgments, a power essential for the evolution and refinement of legal interpretation and application.  This power allows the Supreme Court to adapt to changing societal needs and correct any past errors in judgment. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is much broader than just disputes between the Union and the States.  It is the highest court of appeal in the country, hearing appeals on a wide range of legal matters, including those relating to fundamental rights, constitutional interpretation, and inter-state disputes, among others.  Its jurisdiction is not limited to any specific category of cases.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are legally enforceable in courts.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by guiding the state's policy towards social and economic justice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, are not justiciable.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not directly enforceable in courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to create a just and equitable society.  However, they can influence judicial decisions indirectly and inform the interpretation of Fundamental Rights. Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles reflect the Constitution's commitment to a welfare state, outlining the state's responsibilities in areas such as social security, education, healthcare, and economic justice.  They aim to guide the government's actions in creating a society that is both just and equitable.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing circumstances.


**8. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President is elected indirectly by an electoral college comprising elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies.
2. The President can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament, on the grounds of violation of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is not directly elected by the people but indirectly through an electoral college. This college comprises elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies. The system of indirect election aims to ensure the selection of a leader with broad-based support and experience. Statement 2 is correct. The President can be removed from office only through the process of impeachment by a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Parliament.  The grounds for impeachment are specified in the Constitution, primarily focusing on violation of the Constitution or other serious misconduct. The impeachment process is rigorous and designed to prevent arbitrary removal.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, although such action is usually taken only under exceptional circumstances.  The Governor's position is thus subject to the ultimate authority of the Union Government. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor has certain powers related to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not an absolute power that can be exercised at will.  The Governor typically acts on the advice of the Chief Minister, and the dissolution of the Assembly is subject to constitutional provisions and established conventions.  The Governor's powers are not unlimited in this regard.


**10. With reference to the Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1.  All Union Territories have a Legislative Assembly.
2.  The administrator of a Union Territory is appointed by the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Not all Union Territories have a Legislative Assembly.  The Constitution provides for different administrative structures for Union Territories, some having a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers, while others are administered directly by the President through an administrator. The presence or absence of a Legislative Assembly depends on the specific constitutional provisions for each Union Territory. Statement 2 is correct. The administrator of a Union Territory is appointed by the President of India.  The administrator's powers and responsibilities vary depending on the specific constitutional status and administrative arrangements of the Union Territory. The President's role in appointing the administrator underscores the Union Government's direct control over Union Territories.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution:**

1.  The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review.
2.  All laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Amendment Act in 1951.  The primary intention was to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review, which had been challenged on the grounds of violating fundamental rights.  This was done to accelerate the implementation of land reforms, deemed crucial for social and economic progress. Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially, laws included in the Ninth Schedule were largely considered immune from judicial review,  the Supreme Court's decision in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* (2007) clarified that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  This significantly altered the scope of protection afforded by the Ninth Schedule.


**12. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies ensures effective enforcement of Fundamental Rights.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed by the Constitution, are not absolute.  Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, and other legitimate state concerns. The extent of these restrictions is subject to judicial interpretation and review.  The balance between individual rights and state interests is a recurring theme in constitutional law. Statement 2 is correct.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies, guaranteed under Article 32, is a crucial aspect of Fundamental Rights.  It empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their Fundamental Rights.  This right ensures that Fundamental Rights are not merely theoretical but are effectively protected against violations by the state.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliamentary system of government in India:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The President of India is the head of the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's parliamentary system hinges on the principle of collective responsibility. The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). This means that the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha; a vote of no confidence can lead to the government's resignation.  This ensures accountability of the executive to the legislature. Statement 2 is incorrect.  In India's parliamentary system, the President is the head of state, a largely ceremonial position. The Prime Minister is the head of government, wielding executive power and leading the Council of Ministers.  The distinction between the head of state and the head of government is a key feature of parliamentary systems.


**14. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels in all states.
2.  Panchayati Raj Institutions have the power to levy taxes and raise their own financial resources.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) enshrined the three-tier Panchayati Raj system (village, intermediate, and district levels) in the Constitution.  This amendment aimed to strengthen local self-government and empower rural communities.  The Act provides a constitutional framework for the establishment and functioning of these institutions. Statement 2 is correct.  The 73rd Amendment Act grants Panchayati Raj Institutions the power to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, and fees.  This provision is crucial for their financial autonomy and ability to function effectively.  The specific taxes and duties that can be levied may vary based on state laws, but the constitutional provision provides the fundamental basis for their financial independence.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Rights:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are justiciable, while Directive Principles are not.
2.  There can be a conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, and in such cases, Fundamental Rights generally prevail.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  This is a fundamental difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning that their violation can be challenged in a court of law.  Directive Principles, on the other hand, are not directly enforceable in courts; they serve as guidelines for the state's policy. Statement 2 is correct.  There have been instances where Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have seemed to conflict.  For example, the implementation of land reforms (a Directive Principle) may sometimes clash with the Right to Property (a Fundamental Right).  In such situations, the courts have generally given precedence to Fundamental Rights, but the interpretation and balancing of these competing interests is a complex and evolving area of constitutional law.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Principles aim to establish a comprehensive welfare state by outlining socio-economic and political goals for the nation.
2.  The provisions in these Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Part IV of the Indian Constitution aim to establish a welfare state by outlining socio-economic and political goals.  They guide the state towards achieving social and economic justice, reducing inequalities, and promoting the welfare of the people.  The DPSPs cover a wide range of aspects, including education, healthcare, social security, and the protection of workers' rights.  Their aim is to build a just and equitable society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning courts cannot enforce them directly. This is because they are aspirational goals, meant to guide the state's policy rather than to establish legally enforceable rights.  While courts can consider DPSPs when interpreting other laws, they cannot directly order the government to implement a specific DPSP. The rationale behind this is to provide flexibility for the government to adapt its policies to changing circumstances.  However, the courts have increasingly recognized the importance of DPSPs in shaping government policy and judicial interpretation, leading to greater emphasis on their role in promoting social justice.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill but can suggest amendments.
2. The Rajya Sabha can vote on the Demands for Grants but cannot discuss the Annual Financial Statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's power over Money Bills is absolute. This is a crucial feature of India's parliamentary system, designed to ensure that the government's financial policies are ultimately controlled by the directly elected lower house.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants (part of the budget).  However, it can discuss the Annual Financial Statement (the budget). While the Rajya Sabha's power is limited concerning the budget, its ability to discuss it allows for scrutiny and debate, influencing the government's fiscal policies through public opinion and parliamentary pressure.  This balance of power prevents the Lok Sabha from unchecked control over the nation's finances.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.
2. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the central level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.  The Act retained a significant degree of overlap and fusion of powers, reflecting the colonial context and the lack of a fully independent judiciary.  The Act introduced some reforms, but it didn't fundamentally alter the existing structure of power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919 established a bicameral legislature at the central level, comprising the Council of State (upper house) and the Legislative Assembly (lower house). This bicameral structure was a significant step towards greater legislative representation and a more sophisticated system of governance.  However, the Act still maintained significant limitations on the powers of the legislature, particularly the elected lower house.


**4. When a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it has to be passed by:**

(a) A simple majority of members present and voting.
(b) A three-fourths majority of members present and voting.
(c) A two-thirds majority of the total membership of both Houses.
(d) An absolute majority of the total membership of both Houses.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a).  According to Article 108 of the Indian Constitution, when a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it needs to be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting.  This provision is designed to resolve deadlocks between the two houses and ensure the passage of essential legislation.  While the requirement for a joint sitting highlights the importance of both Houses, the simple majority requirement reflects a pragmatic approach to legislative efficiency.  The other options are incorrect as they prescribe higher thresholds, not stipulated by the Constitution for passing a bill in a joint sitting.


**5. The Government of India has established NITI Aayog to replace the:**

(a) Finance Commission
(b) Human Rights Commission
(c) Law Commission
(d) Planning Commission

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), a policy think tank, was established on January 1, 2015, to replace the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission was a key institution in India's centralized planning system.  NITI Aayog operates on a collaborative federal model, aiming to foster cooperative federalism and encourage states to take a more active role in policy formulation. The other options are incorrect; the Finance Commission, Human Rights Commission, and Law Commission are separate, independent bodies with distinct constitutional or statutory mandates.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union of India is vested in the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex officio Chairman of the National Security Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 53 of the Indian Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President.  However, it's crucial to understand that the President exercises this power on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.  This is a fundamental aspect of India's parliamentary system, where the President is the head of state, but the real executive authority lies with the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not the ex-officio Chairman of the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister plays a central role in the NSC, his position isn't an ex-officio one as defined by the Constitution or any specific law.  The composition and functions of the NSC are determined by the government, allowing for flexibility in its operation.


**7. The provisions in the Fifth Schedule and Sixth Schedule in the Constitution of India are made in order to:**

(a) Determine the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats.
(b) Protect the interests of all the border states.
(c) Determine the boundaries between states.
(d) Protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes and administer tribal areas.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule and Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deal with the administration of Scheduled Areas and tribal areas.  The Fifth Schedule outlines provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas in different states, primarily focusing on the welfare and development of Scheduled Tribes. The Sixth Schedule establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These provisions aim to protect the rights and interests of Scheduled Tribes and enable them to govern their affairs in a more self-determined manner.  The other options are incorrect; they relate to different aspects of the Constitution, such as local governance (Panchayats) or interstate relations.


**8. With reference to the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.
3.  All disbursements made from the Contingency Fund of India require the authorization of the Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget, not the Department of Economic Affairs.  The Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in economic policy and planning, but the actual preparation of the budget is the responsibility of the Department of Revenue.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 266 of the Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India except under the authority of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary control over government spending and financial accountability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Disbursements from the Contingency Fund of India do not require the immediate authorization of Parliament. The Contingency Fund is meant for unforeseen expenses, and the President can authorize withdrawals from it. Parliament's subsequent approval is needed for such withdrawals.


**9. Who/Which of the following is the custodian of the Constitution of India?**

(a) The Prime Minister of India
(b) The Lok Sabha Secretariat
(c) The Supreme Court of India
(d) The President of India

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the President is the head of state and swears to uphold the Constitution, and the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, neither is its custodian.  The Lok Sabha Secretariat is also not the custodian.  The true custodian is the people of India, as the preamble states that the Constitution derives its authority from "We, the People of India."  However, for practical purposes, the Supreme Court, through its power of judicial review, acts as the final interpreter and protector of the Constitution, ensuring its adherence to the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.


**10. Which one of the following was given classical language status recently?**

(a) Bhojpuri
(b) Konkani
(c) Odia
(d) Assamese

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Odia was declared a classical language in 2014 by the Government of India.  Classical language status is given to languages that have a rich history and literary tradition, and which have significantly influenced other languages and cultures.  The other languages mentioned are also rich in culture and language but do not yet have classical language status. The declaration of Odia as a classical language was a significant step in recognizing its cultural importance and preserving its heritage.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Legislative Council of a State in India cannot be larger in size than the Legislative Assembly of that State.
2. The Governor of a State nominates one-sixth of the members of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Legislative Council of a State cannot be larger than the Legislative Assembly of that State.  This is a constitutional provision that reflects the principle that the lower house, directly elected by the people, should have a greater voice in the legislative process.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor nominates one-twelfth of the members of the Legislative Council, not one-sixth. These nominated members are typically experts in various fields, providing a wider range of perspectives in the legislative process.


**12. “To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India” is a provision made in the:**

(a) Fundamental Rights
(b) Directive Principles of State Policy
(c) Fundamental Duties
(d) Preamble of the Constitution

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India" is a provision included in the Fundamental Duties (Part IVA, Article 51A) of the Indian Constitution.  These duties are not legally enforceable but are considered moral obligations on citizens to contribute to the nation's well-being and progress.  The other options are incorrect; the Preamble sets out the objectives of the Constitution, while Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles deal with individual rights and social goals, respectively.


**13. The fundamental object of the Panchayati Raj system is to ensure which among the following:**

1. People’s participation in development
2. Political accountability
3. Democratic decentralization
4. Financial mobilization

Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options are fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system.  Panchayati Raj aims to empower local communities by enabling people's participation in development planning and implementation (1).  It fosters political accountability by bringing governance closer to the people and enhancing their ability to hold elected representatives responsible (2).  It promotes democratic decentralization by transferring power and decision-making authority from central and state governments to local levels (3). It also aims to improve financial management and resource mobilization at the local level (4).


**14. The ideal of “Welfare State” in the Indian Constitution is enshrined in its:**

(a) Seventh Schedule
(b) Fundamental Rights
(c) Directive Principles of State Policy
(d) Preamble

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ideal of a welfare state in the Indian Constitution is primarily enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV).  These principles outline the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve, including providing social security, promoting education and healthcare, and ensuring a minimum standard of living for all citizens.  While the Preamble mentions social justice as an objective, the DPSPs provide the detailed framework for building a welfare state.  Fundamental Rights primarily focus on individual liberties, and the Seventh Schedule deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States.


**15. There is a Parliamentary System of Government in India because the:**

(a) Rajya Sabha cannot be dissolved.
(b) Parliament can amend the Constitution.
(c) Lok Sabha is elected directly by the people.
(d) Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India has a parliamentary system because the Council of Ministers (the government) is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  This means that the government can only remain in power as long as it enjoys the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  If the Lok Sabha loses confidence in the government, it can be removed through a vote of no confidence.  This is a fundamental feature distinguishing a parliamentary system from a presidential system, where the executive is independent of the legislature.  The other options are not the defining characteristics of a parliamentary system, though they are relevant aspects of India's political system.


**16. Consider the following statements:**

1. A Bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses on its prorogation.
2. A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, shall not lapse on dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses when the Lok Sabha is prorogued (its session is adjourned indefinitely).  This is a standard parliamentary procedure ensuring that bills are brought back for consideration in a new session.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, lapses on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  Dissolution of the Lok Sabha brings an end to the legislative process for bills that have not yet been passed by both houses.  This is because the Lok Sabha's approval is essential for any bill to become law.  The Rajya Sabha's role is mainly to review and amend bills; its approval is not sufficient for a bill to become law without Lok Sabha approval.



**17. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Chief Secretary in a State is appointed by the Governor of that State.
2. The Chief Secretary in a State has a fixed tenure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chief Secretary in a State is appointed by the Governor of that State.  The Governor, as the head of the State's executive, appoints the Chief Secretary, the highest-ranking civil servant in the state's administrative hierarchy.  The appointment is usually made on the advice of the Chief Minister.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chief Secretary in a State does not have a fixed tenure.  While they may serve for a considerable period, their term is not fixed by law.  Their tenure can be influenced by various factors, including changes in government, performance evaluations, and administrative needs.  The flexibility in tenure allows for adaptability in the administrative structure.


**18. With reference to the “Gram Nyayalaya Act”, which of the following statements is/are correct?**

1. As per the Act, Gram Nyayalayas can hear only civil cases and not criminal cases.
2. The Act allows local social activists as mediators/reconciliators.

Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas (Village Courts) can hear both civil and criminal cases, as per the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.  These courts are designed to provide speedy and accessible justice at the village level.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators to help resolve disputes amicably.  This reflects the Act's focus on promoting informal dispute resolution mechanisms to reduce the burden on formal courts and improve access to justice in rural areas.


**19. The Parliament of India acquires the power to legislate on any item in the State List in the national interest if a resolution to that effect is passed by the:**

(a) Rajya Sabha by a simple majority of its total membership.
(b) Lok Sabha by a majority of not less than two-thirds of its total membership.
(c) Lok Sabha by a simple majority of its total membership.
(d) Rajya Sabha by a majority of not less than two-thirds of its members present and voting.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 249 of the Indian Constitution allows Parliament to legislate on any subject in the State List (matters within the purview of state governments) if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary in the national interest. The resolution requires a simple majority of the total membership of the Rajya Sabha. Once the resolution is passed, Parliament can make laws on the specified subject for a period not exceeding one year, and the resolution can be renewed.  This provision reflects the balance of power between the Union and the States, allowing for Union intervention in matters of national importance.


**20. Consider the following statements:**

1. The minimum age prescribed for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.
2. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues only for the remainder period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for a person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years, not 25 years as stated.  This is a constitutional requirement under the 73rd Amendment Act, aiming to ensure that younger individuals can participate in local governance.

Statement 2 is correct. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues only for the remaining period of its original term. This ensures that the term of a reconstituted Panchayat aligns with the original schedule, preventing any extension of power beyond the mandated period.


**21. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals were related to:**

(a) Social reforms
(b) Educational reforms
(c) Reforms in police administration
(d) Constitutional reforms

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals (1918) were primarily concerned with constitutional reforms in India.  These proposals, which led to the Government of India Act of 1919, aimed to introduce greater Indian participation in governance.  While some aspects of the proposals touched upon social and educational matters, the core focus was on reforming the existing constitutional framework.  The proposals introduced dyarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level, granting some legislative powers to Indians.  However, the proposals fell short of complete self-governance, and they were subject to significant criticism.


**22. Which one of the following objectives is not embodied in the Preamble to the Constitution of India?**

(a) Liberty of thought
(b) Economic liberty
(c) Liberty of expression
(d) Liberty of belief

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution mentions Liberty, but it does not specifically mention "Economic Liberty" as a distinct objective.  While the Constitution aims to secure social, economic, and political justice, economic liberty is not explicitly stated in the Preamble.  The Preamble emphasizes liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, reflecting the commitment to individual freedoms.  However, the concept of economic liberty is addressed more directly in the Directive Principles of State Policy, which guide the state towards achieving economic equality and social justice.


**23. The mind of the makers of the Constitution of India is reflected in which of the following?**

(a) The Fundamental Duties
(b) The Directive Principles of State Policy
(c) The Preamble
(d) The Fundamental Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution best reflects the ideals and aspirations of its framers.  It succinctly summarizes the core values and objectives that guided the Constitution's creation.  The Preamble states that the Constitution aims to secure justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens.  While the Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles, and Fundamental Duties are important components of the Constitution, they do not comprehensively represent the overall vision and philosophy of the framers as the Preamble does.


**24. Which of the following are envisaged by the Right against Exploitation in the Constitution of India?**

1. Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour
2. Abolition of untouchability
3. Protection of the interests of minorities
4. Prohibition of employment of children in factories and mines

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Right against Exploitation (Article 23 and 24) in the Indian Constitution primarily focuses on prohibiting certain forms of exploitation.  It prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour (1) and the employment of children in hazardous work (4).  Abolition of untouchability is a separate right (Article 17), and protection of minority interests is covered under other articles (e.g., Articles 29 and 30).


**25. Which one of the following statements is correct?**

(a) Rights are privileges which are incorporated in the Constitution of a State.
(b) Rights are claims of the State against the citizens.
(c) Rights are claims of the citizens against the State.
(d) Rights are privileges of a few citizens against the many.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental rights are claims that citizens can make against the state.  They are limitations on the state's power to ensure that the state does not act arbitrarily or infringe upon the fundamental freedoms and rights of its citizens.  The other options are incorrect; rights are not merely privileges granted by the state but fundamental entitlements inherent to citizenship, and they are not claims of the state against citizens or limited to a select few.


**26. Which of the following statements is/are true of the Fundamental Duties of an Indian citizen?**

1. A legislative process has been provided to enforce these duties.
2. They are correlative to legal rights.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. No specific legislative process has been provided to enforce Fundamental Duties. They are primarily moral obligations, not legally enforceable rights.  While the state can promote these duties through education and public awareness, there is no legal mechanism for directly enforcing them.

Statement 2 is correct. Fundamental Duties are considered correlative to legal rights. This means that the enjoyment of rights comes with certain responsibilities towards the society and the state.  While not directly enforceable, Fundamental Duties emphasize the reciprocal relationship between rights and responsibilities.


**27. In the context of India, which one of the following is the correct relationship between Rights and Duties?**

(a) Rights are personal and hence independent of society and Duties.
(b) Rights, not Duties, are important for the advancement of the personality of the citizen.
(c) Duties, not Rights, are important for the stability of the State.
(d) Rights are correlative with Duties.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

In India, rights and duties are considered correlative.  This means that the enjoyment of rights implies certain responsibilities and duties towards society and the state.  The Constitution includes both Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties to emphasize this interdependency.  While rights protect individual freedoms, duties promote social harmony and national progress.  The other options present an incomplete or inaccurate view of the relationship between rights and duties in the Indian context.


**28. Which principle among the following was added to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution?**

(a) Right to work, education, and public assistance
(b) Participation of workers in the management of industries
(c) Securing living wage and human conditions of work to workers
(d) Equal pay for equal work for both men and women

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution added the principle of "equal pay for equal work for both men and women" to the Directive Principles of State Policy.  This amendment reflects the growing emphasis on gender equality and social justice.  The other options are already existing principles or are not specifically added by the 42nd Amendment.  The addition of this principle demonstrated a commitment to ensuring equal opportunities and fair treatment for all genders in the workplace.


**29. Consider the following statements: With reference to the Constitution of India, the Directive Principles of State Policy constitute limitations upon:**

1. Legislative function.
2. Executive function.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) act as limitations on both legislative and executive functions.  While not directly enforceable by courts, DPSPs guide the state's actions and policies.  Laws passed by the legislature should ideally align with the spirit of DPSPs.  Similarly, the executive branch's policies and actions are expected to reflect the goals and objectives laid out in the DPSPs.  This ensures that the state's functioning is guided by the principles of social justice and welfare.


**30. For election to the Lok Sabha, a nomination paper can be filed by:**

(a) Anyone residing in India.
(b) A resident of the constituency from which the election is to be contested.
(c) Any citizen of India whose name appears in the electoral roll of a constituency.
(d) Any citizen of India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only a citizen of India whose name appears on the electoral roll of a constituency can file a nomination paper for election to the Lok Sabha.  This requirement is crucial for ensuring that only eligible voters can contest elections.  The other options are incorrect; residency in India or being a citizen is not sufficient; the candidate's name must be on the electoral roll of the constituency from which they are contesting.


**31. Consider the following statements:**

1. In the election for Lok Sabha or State Assembly, the winning candidate must get at least 50 percent of the votes polled to be declared elected.
2. According to the provisions laid down in the Constitution of India, in the Lok Sabha, the Speaker's post goes to the majority party and the Deputy Speaker's to the Opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the first-past-the-post system used for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections, the candidate securing the highest number of votes in a constituency is declared elected, regardless of whether they obtain 50% or more of the votes.  The system does not require a majority of votes, only a plurality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does not mandate that the Speaker's post in the Lok Sabha goes to the majority party and the Deputy Speaker's to the Opposition.  While this is a common practice, the Constitution leaves the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to the discretion of the Lok Sabha.  The choice reflects the prevailing parliamentary dynamics.


**32. Right to vote and to be elected in India is a:**

(a) Natural Right
(b) Fundamental Right
(c) Legal Right
(d) Constitutional Right

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The right to vote and be elected in India is a Constitutional Right.  It is enshrined in the Constitution and is not a fundamental right, natural right, or merely a legal right. While it stems from the constitutional framework and is legally protected, it's not a fundamental right like freedom of speech or religion.  Constitutional rights are rights granted by the Constitution and are subject to constitutional limitations and amendments.


**33. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a three-member body.
2. Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.
3. The Election Commission resolves disputes relating to splits/mergers of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners, making it a three-member body.  The number of commissioners can be increased by the government, but currently, it is three.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent body, decides the election schedule, not the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.  The independence of the Election Commission is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.

Statement 3 is correct. The Election Commission of India resolves disputes relating to splits/mergers of recognized political parties.  This power is essential for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and ensuring that political parties operate within the legal framework.


**34. Which of the following are not necessarily the consequences of the proclamation of the President’s rule in a State?**

1. Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly
2. Removal of the Council of Ministers in the State
3. Dissolution of the local bodies

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly (1) and removal of the Council of Ministers (2) are usual consequences, but not mandatory, of the imposition of President's Rule under Article 356.  Dissolution of local bodies (3) is not a necessary consequence of President's Rule.  While the President's rule suspends the normal functioning of the state government, it does not automatically lead to the dissolution of all local bodies.  The decision to dissolve local bodies depends on the specific circumstances and the government's assessment of the situation.


**35. Which one of the following is not a feature of Indian federalism?**

(a) It is the result of an agreement among the federating units.
(b) Powers have been clearly divided between the Centre and the States.
(c) There is an independent judiciary in India.
(d) The federating units have been given unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Indian federalism is not the result of an agreement among the federating units.  Unlike some other federations, Indian federalism emerged from a process of constitutional design and enactment, not a negotiated agreement between pre-existing independent entities.  While there was a degree of negotiation and consensus-building during the framing of the Constitution, the final outcome was a centrally designed structure, not a product of bargaining between independent states.


**36. Local self-government can be best explained as an exercise in:**

(a) Administrative delegation
(b) Direct democracy
(c) Federalism
(d) Democratic decentralization

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Local self-government is best understood as an exercise in democratic decentralization.  It involves transferring power and decision-making authority from higher levels of government (central and state) to local bodies like Panchayats and Municipalities.  This process aims to enhance citizen participation, accountability, and responsiveness of governance.  While elements of administrative delegation and direct democracy might be present in local governance, the core concept is decentralization of power within a democratic framework.


**37. The Parliament of India exercises control over the functions of the Council of Ministers through:**

1. Adjournment motion
2. Question hour
3. Supplementary questions

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers through various mechanisms, including adjournment motions (1), question hour (2), and supplementary questions (3).  Adjournment motions allow for debates on urgent matters of public importance, potentially holding the government accountable.  Question hour provides an opportunity for MPs to question ministers about government policies and actions. Supplementary questions allow for further probing of answers given during the question hour.  These mechanisms are essential for parliamentary oversight of the executive branch.


**38. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member’s bill is a bill presented by a Member of Parliament who is not elected but only nominated by the President of India.
2. Recently, a private member’s bill has been passed in the Parliament of India for the first time in its history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a minister.  It doesn't matter whether the MP is elected or nominated; any MP who is not a minister can introduce a private member's bill.

Statement 

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Government of India Act of 1919 clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2.  The Government of India Act of 1919  introduced a system of dyarchy, dividing powers between the central and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, is primarily remembered for its introduction of dyarchy.  Dyarchy, a system of dual government, divided administrative responsibilities between the central government and the provincial governments.  Certain subjects (like law and order, revenue, and irrigation) were transferred to Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures, while others (like defense and finance) remained under the control of the British Governor. This partially devolved power to Indian leaders.  The Act did not, however, explicitly define a strict separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature in the manner understood in modern constitutional frameworks. The judiciary’s independence was not fully established, and legislative oversight of the judiciary was not clearly delineated.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the core structural change introduced by the 1919 Act, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the key features of the 1919 Act.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of a "Welfare State" is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble of the Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy aim to establish a "Welfare State" by outlining the socio-economic goals of the Indian state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Indian Constitution strives to create a welfare state, this ideal is not explicitly stated in the Preamble.  The Preamble focuses on establishing a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, aiming to secure justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity to all citizens. The concept of a "welfare state" is implied but not directly articulated. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  In contrast, the Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV of the Constitution) explicitly outline the socio-economic goals that are integral to a welfare state. These principles guide the state in promoting the welfare of its citizens through provisions related to social security, education, healthcare, and economic equality. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The correct option is (b) because it accurately reflects the constitutional placement and the role of the Directive Principles in promoting the welfare state ideal.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tenth Schedule deals with the disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on the grounds of defection.  The provisions were added by the 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1985.
2.  The Fifth and Sixth Schedules to the Constitution deal with the administration of tribal areas in certain states. The provisions were added by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Tenth Schedule, also known as the Anti-Defection Law, was introduced through the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985. It aims to curb defections by legislators from one party to another by laying out the grounds for disqualification.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Fifth and Sixth Schedules were part of the original Constitution and deal with the administration of tribal areas in specific states.  They were not introduced by the 73rd and 74th Amendments (which dealt with Panchayats and Municipalities respectively). The 73rd and 74th Amendments added Parts IX and IX-A to the Constitution, respectively, dealing with Panchayats and Municipalities and not the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer as it correctly identifies the Tenth Schedule's function and the amendment that introduced it.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions related to Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to privacy.
2.  Article 17 abolishes untouchability and all forms of discrimination based on caste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct and accurately reflect key aspects of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution. Article 21, the right to life and personal liberty, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in various landmark judgments to encompass a wide range of rights, including the right to privacy, a right to clean environment, a right to education and many more.  This expansive interpretation has significantly shaped the scope of fundamental rights.  Similarly, Article 17 unequivocally abolishes untouchability and explicitly prohibits any form of discrimination based on caste.  It is a crucial article in ensuring social equality and combating caste-based discrimination.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer as both statements correctly describe the content and implications of Articles 21 and 17.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.
2. The President of India can nominate two members of the Anglo-Indian community to the Lok Sabha if, in the President’s opinion, that community is not adequately represented in the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The President of India has the power to nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), representing persons of eminence in fields like art, literature, science, and social service. This provision ensures that expertise from diverse fields is represented in the upper house.  Additionally, the President also has the power to nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian community to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) if, in the President's judgment, this community is not adequately represented through direct elections.  This provision aims to ensure representation for minority communities. Therefore, option (c) is correct because it accurately reflects the President's nominating powers under the Constitution for both houses of Parliament.



**6. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution divides legislative powers between the Union and the States.
2. The Union List contains subjects on which only the Union Parliament can legislate.  The State List contains subjects on which only the State Legislatures can legislate.  The Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Union and State Legislatures can legislate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of India's federal structure as enshrined in the Constitution. The Seventh Schedule is a crucial component of the Constitution, outlining the distribution of legislative powers among the Union and State governments. It divides these powers into three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List. Statement 1 correctly points to this division.  Statement 2 correctly explains the nature of legislative authority under each list.  The Union List contains subjects of national importance, such as defense, foreign affairs, and currency. The State List contains subjects of regional or local importance, such as public order, police, and local government. The Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Union and State governments can legislate.  In cases of conflict, Union law prevails.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, accurately reflecting the structure and function of the Seventh Schedule in the Indian federal setup.


**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning that they can be enforced by the courts.
2. The Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable, meaning that they cannot be enforced by the courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy are *non-justiciable*, meaning courts cannot directly enforce them. They are meant to guide the state in formulating policies aimed at social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  Conversely, Fundamental Rights are *justiciable*, meaning individuals can approach courts to enforce them if they are violated. These rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and are enforceable by the courts.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer as both statements incorrectly characterize the justiciability of Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is both the Head of State and the Head of Government.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the Head of Government, while the President is the Head of State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India follows a parliamentary system of government.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  In a parliamentary system, the Head of State (the President) is largely a ceremonial figure, while the Head of Government (the Prime Minister) wields real executive power.  The President's powers are largely defined by the Constitution and exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Statement 2 correctly describes the division of executive powers between the President and the Prime Minister in India's parliamentary system.  The Prime Minister, as the head of the governing party or coalition, leads the executive branch and is responsible to the Parliament. The President acts as the symbolic head of the nation. Therefore, option (b) is correct.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Preamble to the Constitution declares India to be a "Secular" state.
2.  The concept of Secularism in India implies the absence of any state religion and equal treatment of all religions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct and reflect the understanding of secularism as enshrined in the Indian Constitution. The Preamble explicitly declares India to be a "Secular" state, signifying the separation of religion from the state.  This is a key feature of India's constitutional framework.  Furthermore, the concept of secularism in India goes beyond mere neutrality; it implies equal respect and treatment for all religions, without favoring any particular religion as the state religion.  The state actively promotes religious tolerance and freedom of conscience. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer as both statements accurately capture the meaning and implications of secularism in the Indian context.


**10. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha (House of the People).
2.  A Money Bill can be introduced in the Lok Sabha only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. It can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha, which may or may not be accepted. The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills.  Statement 2 is correct.  A Money Bill, which deals primarily with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system, emphasizing the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer because it accurately identifies the Rajya Sabha's limited power regarding Money Bills and the exclusive right of the Lok Sabha to initiate such bills.


**1. With reference to the powers of the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India has the power to initiate suo moto action in cases of electoral malpractices.
2.  The Election Commission of India can only decide disputes related to the election of the President and Vice-President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body with the power to take suo moto action (action taken on its own initiative) in cases of electoral malpractices or violations of the model code of conduct.  This power is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections. The ECI's powers are extensive, covering various aspects of the electoral process, including registration of voters, nomination of candidates, and the conduct of elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India's jurisdiction extends far beyond the elections of the President and Vice-President. It is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and also to the offices of the President and Vice-President. The ECI also has the power to decide disputes related to these elections, however, it also deals with  matters related to the registration of political parties, and resolving disputes arising from the mergers or splits of recognized political parties.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, blending elements of both federal and unitary systems.
2. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Prime Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian federal system is often described as a quasi-federal or asymmetrical federal system.  While it has features of a federation, such as a division of powers between the Centre and the States, it also incorporates significant unitary elements.  The central government's dominance in certain areas, the power of the President to impose President's rule in states, and the presence of All-India Services are examples of this unitary bias.  The flexibility and adaptability of the Indian Constitution allow for a dynamic balance between federal and unitary principles, making it unique among federations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India, and this appointment is typically made on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.  This reflects the central government's significant influence over state-level governance. While the Governor is the nominal head of the state, the actual executive power rests with the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers.


**3. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee examines the past expenditure of the government to ensure accountability.
2. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Estimates Committee of the Parliament in India is a crucial parliamentary body that examines the estimates included in the Union Budget. Its primary role is to review the government's proposed expenditure *before* it is approved by the Parliament, thereby promoting efficiency and economy in government spending.  It does not primarily focus on past expenditure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is another important parliamentary committee responsible for scrutinizing the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). The CAG audits the government's accounts, and the PAC examines these audit reports to hold the government accountable for its financial management.  The PAC's findings are crucial for ensuring transparency and preventing financial irregularities.


**4. With reference to the President of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The President can promulgate ordinances even when the Parliament is in session.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India, as the head of state, possesses the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). However, this power is not exercised independently.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.  This reflects the principle of parliamentary democracy, where the executive is responsible to the legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India has the power to promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session. This is a crucial power that allows the executive to address urgent matters that require immediate legislative action. However, this power is limited, as ordinances must be approved by Parliament within a specified period, otherwise they lapse.  Ordinances cannot be issued when the Parliament is in session.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the final arbiter on the constitutional validity of laws.
2.  High Courts in India can only hear appeals against the decisions of subordinate courts within their respective states.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India enjoys the power of judicial review, which means it can determine the constitutional validity of laws passed by the Parliament or State Legislatures, or executive actions of the government.  Its decisions are binding on all other courts in the country, making it the ultimate authority on constitutional matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While High Courts primarily hear appeals from subordinate courts within their respective states, their jurisdiction is not limited to this.  High Courts also possess original jurisdiction in certain matters, and they can also hear appeals against the decisions of tribunals or other authorities.  Furthermore, High Courts can also issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal remedies.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in a court of law.  They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating its policies and laws, aimed at promoting the welfare of the citizens.  While courts cannot compel the government to implement DPSPs, they can influence government action indirectly by interpreting laws and policies in light of the DPSPs' spirit.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs are a crucial part of the Indian Constitution, aiming to establish a welfare state.  They are inspired by various social and economic philosophies and aim to achieve social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens. They cover a wide range of areas, including education, healthcare, employment, and social security.


**7.  With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Finance Bill, which gives effect to the financial proposals in the Budget, must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is first presented to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  Only after it is passed by the Lok Sabha is it sent to the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) for consideration. The Rajya Sabha has limited powers in this regard, primarily to recommend changes.  It cannot reject a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Bill, which incorporates the financial proposals of the Union Budget, is a Money Bill and must be passed by both houses of Parliament, although the Rajya Sabha's power to amend it is limited to recommending changes.  The Lok Sabha's approval is essential for the Finance Bill to become law.


**8. With reference to the Governor of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.  The Governor acts as the nominal head of the state, representing the Union government at the state level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, it is not at their discretion to do so at any time.  The Governor typically dissolves the Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister, especially when the government loses its majority in the assembly.  The Governor may also dissolve the Assembly under specific constitutional circumstances, such as the imposition of President's rule.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Equality prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2. The Right to Freedom includes the freedom of speech and expression, but with reasonable restrictions.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 14-18 of the Indian Constitution enshrines the Right to Equality, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This is a fundamental principle of the Indian Constitution, promoting equality and social justice.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 19 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Freedom, which includes several freedoms, including the freedom of speech and expression. However, these freedoms are not absolute. The Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on these freedoms in the interest of public order, security, decency, etc.  The courts have played a significant role in defining the boundaries of these restrictions.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is appointed by the President of India. This appointment is made for a fixed term, and the CAG enjoys considerable independence from the executive branch of the government.  This independence is crucial for ensuring the impartiality of audits.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG's responsibilities extend to auditing the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  This ensures that public funds at all levels of government are subject to independent scrutiny.  The CAG's reports are crucial for promoting transparency and accountability in government finances.


**1. With reference to the Union and its Territory, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to admit into the Union or establish new states.
2.  The territory of India as it existed in 1950 is significantly different from its current territorial extent.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the Parliament the power to form new states and alter the boundaries or names of existing states.  This reflects the dynamic nature of the Indian Union and its ability to adapt to changing political and geographical realities.  The process involves parliamentary legislation and is subject to certain safeguards to prevent arbitrary changes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The territory of India in 1950, as defined in the original Constitution, was smaller than its present extent.  Several significant territorial changes have occurred since then, including the integration of princely states, the reorganization of states on linguistic lines, and the creation of new Union Territories.  These changes have expanded the geographical area under the Union's jurisdiction. The difference is substantial and reflects historical processes of nation-building and administrative restructuring.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Union and its evolving territorial boundaries.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Citizenship of India:**

1.  The provisions related to citizenship are comprehensively outlined in Part II of the Constitution.
2.  Acquisition of citizenship through naturalization requires a minimum residency period of 11 years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Part II of the Constitution deals with Citizenship, it doesn't provide a fully exhaustive list of provisions. The details of citizenship are elaborated in subsequent constitutional amendments and related legislation, such as the Citizenship Act of 1955.  The Constitution lays the foundation but further legislative action fleshes out the specifics.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Citizenship Act of 1955, which is enacted under the authority given by Part II of the Constitution, stipulates that a minimum of 11 years of continuous residence in India is a requirement for acquiring citizenship through naturalization.  This residency requirement is a crucial element of the naturalization process, ensuring a period of sufficient integration and familiarity with the country before citizenship is granted.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**3. With reference to Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Property, initially a Fundamental Right, was subsequently transformed into a legal right.
2.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be subject to any restrictions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Right to Property, originally enshrined as a Fundamental Right under Article 31 of the Constitution, was amended by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.  This amendment removed it from the list of Fundamental Rights and transformed it into a legal right under Article 300-A. This reflects a shift in constitutional priorities, emphasizing other fundamental rights over property rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial for individual liberty and dignity, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  These restrictions are often subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure they are proportionate and do not unduly infringe on fundamental freedoms.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the evolution of Fundamental Rights in India.


**4. With reference to Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are justiciable, meaning they are directly enforceable in a court of law.
2.  They aim to establish a social and economic order that promotes social justice and welfare.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not justiciable. This means they are not directly enforceable in courts of law. They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies and laws that promote social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights for individuals.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles reflects a balance between individual rights and the state's responsibility to promote social welfare.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles are designed to establish a social and economic order that promotes social justice, economic equality, and the general welfare of the people. They represent the state's commitment to creating a more equitable and just society.  These principles are aspirational and serve as a framework for the state's policy-making.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Amendment of the Constitution:**

1.  The procedure for amending the Constitution is laid out in Article 368.
2.  All parts of the Constitution can be amended through the same procedure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 368 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. This procedure varies depending on the nature of the amendment, with some requiring a simple majority in Parliament while others necessitate a special majority or ratification by state legislatures. This flexibility reflects the need to balance the stability of the Constitution with the capacity for adaptation to changing circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not provide for a single, uniform amendment procedure for all provisions.  Certain provisions, particularly those relating to the basic structure of the Constitution, are considered to be beyond the scope of amendment.  The Supreme Court's interpretation of the "basic structure doctrine" has played a significant role in limiting the scope of amendment powers.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the complexities of constitutional amendment in India.


**6. With reference to the Basic Structure of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of the basic structure was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
2.  The basic structure doctrine limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The landmark Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) established the concept of the "basic structure" of the Constitution.  This case set a precedent for judicial review of constitutional amendments, asserting that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or abrogated even through the amendment process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The basic structure doctrine effectively limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  It prevents the Parliament from making amendments that fundamentally alter or destroy the essential features of the Constitution, such as secularism, democracy, and federalism.  This doctrine acts as a safeguard to protect the core values and principles upon which the Constitution is founded.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe this critical aspect of Indian constitutional law.



**7. With reference to the Schedules of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule initially protected certain laws from judicial review, but this protection was later curtailed.
2. The Eleventh Schedule details the powers, responsibilities, and authorities of Municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution was initially used to protect certain laws from judicial review, essentially shielding them from challenges on the grounds of violating Fundamental Rights or other constitutional provisions. However, the Supreme Court's decision in I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (2007) significantly curtailed the scope of this protection, ruling that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.  This reflects the ongoing tension between legislative power and judicial oversight in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Eleventh Schedule pertains to Panchayats, not Municipalities.  The Twelfth Schedule deals with the powers, authorities, and responsibilities of Municipalities.  This distinction is important for understanding the constitutional framework for local self-government in India.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Sources of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a significant source for administrative details and emergency provisions.
2. The French Constitution significantly influenced the Directive Principles of State Policy.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a major source for the framers of the Indian Constitution.  A substantial number of provisions, particularly those relating to administrative structure, legislative procedures, and emergency powers, were borrowed or adapted from this Act. This reflects the pragmatic approach of the Constituent Assembly in utilizing existing legal frameworks while incorporating new principles and ideals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While several sources contributed to the Directive Principles of State Policy, the French Constitution is not among them.  The Irish Constitution is considered a more significant source for the Directive Principles, along with other sources such as the Canadian Constitution and the Soviet Constitution.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately identifies a key source of the Indian Constitution.


**9. With reference to the Preamble of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.
2. The Preamble mentions the date of the Constitution's commencement as January 26, 1950.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution clearly and unequivocally declares India to be a "Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic." These words define the fundamental nature of the Indian state and its commitment to various principles and ideals, including sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy, and republicanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Preamble mentions the date of the Constitution's *adoption*, enactment, and giving to ourselves as November 26, 1949.  January 26, 1950, is the date of its *commencement* or enforcement, which is a separate event.  The distinction between adoption and commencement is crucial in understanding the timeline of the Constitution's creation and implementation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Constituent Assembly:**

1. The Constituent Assembly was based on adult suffrage.
2. The Assembly's proceedings were dominated by the Congress Party.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constituent Assembly was *not* based on adult suffrage. Its members were elected indirectly through the Provincial Assemblies, which themselves were not based on universal adult franchise at the time.  The principle of adult franchise was only fully implemented later, after the Constitution came into effect.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constituent Assembly was indeed dominated by the Indian National Congress, which held a significant majority of seats.  While other parties and independent members participated, the Congress's influence was preponderant in shaping the Constitution's provisions and debates.  This dominance reflects the Congress's leading role in India's independence movement.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the Committees of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru chaired both the Union Powers Committee and the Union Constitution Committee.
2.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel chaired the Drafting Committee.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru, a key figure in the Constituent Assembly, chaired both the Union Powers Committee and the Union Constitution Committee. These committees played crucial roles in defining the powers of the Union government and the structure of the Union. Nehru's chairmanship reflects his significant influence in shaping the Constitution's federal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar chaired the Drafting Committee, which was responsible for drafting the final text of the Constitution. Ambedkar's role as chairman reflects his expertise in law and his crucial contribution to the Constitution's legal architecture. Sardar Patel chaired the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities, and Tribal and Excluded Areas.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Enactment of the Constitution:**

1. The final draft of the Constitution was introduced in the Constituent Assembly on November 4, 1949.
2. The Constitution, as adopted, contained 395 articles and 8 schedules.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The final draft of the Constitution was introduced in the Constituent Assembly on November 4, 1948, not 1949.  This date marks the beginning of the formal consideration and debate on the draft Constitution in the Assembly.  The error in the year highlights the importance of precise chronological accuracy in understanding constitutional history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution, as adopted on November 26, 1949, indeed contained 395 articles and 8 schedules. These figures represent the initial structure and scope of the Constitution, which has since been expanded through numerous amendments.  The accuracy of this statement underscores the importance of knowing the original composition of the Constitution.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**13. With reference to the Criticism of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. Critics argued that the Assembly was not a truly representative body because its members were not directly elected by the people on the basis of universal adult franchise.
2.  The critics argued that the Assembly's work was excessively time-consuming, contrasting it with the speed of the American Constitution's creation.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A significant criticism leveled against the Constituent Assembly was that it lacked complete representativeness because its members were not directly elected by the people based on universal adult franchise.  The indirect election process through Provincial Assemblies was a point of contention for some critics, who argued that this method did not fully reflect the will of the Indian populace.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Critics pointed to the lengthy duration of the Constituent Assembly's deliberations as a shortcoming.  Comparisons were often made with the relatively shorter timeframe taken to create the American Constitution, suggesting that the Indian process was excessively prolonged.  This criticism highlights differing approaches to constitutional drafting and the balance between thoroughness and expediency.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect criticisms of the Constituent Assembly's composition and process.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Interim Government of 1946:**

1. Jawaharlal Nehru served as the Vice-President of the Executive Council.
2. The Interim Government was formed after the acceptance of the Cabinet Mission Plan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jawaharlal Nehru held the position of *President* of the Executive Council in the Interim Government of 1946, not Vice-President.  This position was equivalent to the Prime Minister in a later parliamentary system.  The error in the title highlights the importance of precise factual accuracy in understanding historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. The formation of the Interim Government in 1946 was a direct consequence of the acceptance of the Cabinet Mission Plan. The plan proposed the formation of an interim government to prepare for the transfer of power, and the Congress's participation in this government was a significant step towards independence. The accuracy of this statement demonstrates a grasp of the historical context of the Interim Government.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**15. With reference to the First Cabinet of Free India (1947), consider the following statements:**

1.  It was formed immediately after India's independence on August 15, 1947.
2.  The Cabinet included members from both the Congress and the Muslim League.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The First Cabinet of Free India was formed immediately after India gained independence on August 15, 1947, reflecting the swift transition to self-governance. This rapid formation highlights the urgency and preparedness of the Indian leadership in assuming responsibility for the newly independent nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The First Cabinet of Free India primarily consisted of members from the Indian National Congress.  While the Muslim League had participated in the Interim Government of 1946, the partition of India led to the formation of Pakistan, and the Muslim League's participation in the Indian government ended. The inaccuracy of this statement demonstrates the need to appreciate the complexities of the partition and its impact on the composition of the Indian government.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Allocation of Seats in the Constituent Assembly of India (1946):**

1.  The allocation of seats was based solely on the population of the provinces.
2.  The allocation included seats reserved for various communities and interests.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While population was a factor in the allocation of seats in the Constituent Assembly of India (1946), it wasn't the sole criterion.  The allocation also took into account other factors such as representation of various communities and interests, including religious minorities and princely states.  The inaccuracy in this statement highlights the complexity of the process of forming a representative body in a diverse nation.

Statement 2 is correct. The allocation of seats in the Constituent Assembly did indeed include seats reserved for specific communities and interests to ensure their representation in the constitution-making process.  This approach aimed to address historical inequalities and ensure that the views of all sections of society were considered.  The accuracy of this statement reflects an understanding of the inclusive approach adopted in forming the Assembly.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**17. With reference to the Sessions of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constituent Assembly held a total of 12 sessions.
2.  The final session of the Constituent Assembly was held on January 26, 1950.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constituent Assembly held a total of 11 sessions, not 12, over a period of two years, eleven months, and eighteen days.  The error in the number of sessions indicates the importance of accurate factual recall in constitutional history.

Statement 2 is correct. The final session of the Constituent Assembly was indeed held on January 26, 1950, the day the Constitution came into effect.  This date is significant because it marks the culmination of the constitution-making process and the transition to a new political order.  The accuracy of this statement demonstrates an understanding of the historical significance of the date.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**18. Consider the following statements about the Experts Committee of the Congress:**

1.  The committee was formed after the elections to the Constituent Assembly were completed.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru chaired the committee.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Congress Experts Committee was appointed on July 8, 1946, *while* elections to the Constituent Assembly were still underway.  This proactive step demonstrates the Congress's preparation for the constitution-making process.  The error in the timeline underscores the need to have precise knowledge of historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru did indeed chair the Congress Experts Committee.  His leadership reflects his central role in the Indian National Congress and his influence in shaping the constitutional framework.  The accuracy of this statement demonstrates an understanding of Nehru's key role in the constitution-making process.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**19. With reference to the recommendations of the Ashok Mehta Committee on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj institutions.
2. The committee advocated for compulsory powers of taxation for Panchayati Raj institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashok Mehta Committee recommended a *two-tier* system of Panchayati Raj institutions, consisting of a Zila Parishad at the district level and Mandal Panchayats at the intermediate level.  This recommendation differed from the earlier Balwantrai Mehta Committee's three-tier structure.  The error in the number of tiers highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of different committee recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ashok Mehta Committee strongly advocated for granting compulsory powers of taxation to Panchayati Raj institutions. This recommendation aimed to enhance their financial autonomy and enable them to function effectively.  The accuracy of this statement demonstrates an understanding of the committee's focus on strengthening local governance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**20. Consider the following statements about the Balwantray Mehta Committee:**

1. The committee recommended that the District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zila Parishad.
2. The committee's report focused on administrative arrangements for rural development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Balwantray Mehta Committee did *not* recommend that the District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zila Parishad.  Instead, it suggested a different structure for the Panchayati Raj system. The inaccuracy highlights the need for precise knowledge of the committee's recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Balwantray Mehta Committee's report touched upon aspects of rural development, its primary focus was on the structure and functioning of Panchayati Raj institutions, not solely on administrative arrangements.  The inaccuracy demonstrates the importance of understanding the central theme of the committee's work.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate.  The committee focused on democratic decentralization through a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj.


**21. With reference to Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Panchayati Raj was first adopted by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act provides a constitutional status to Panchayati Raj institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Panchayati Raj, as a system of rural local government, was first adopted by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 1959.  This early adoption reflects the states' proactive approach to decentralizing governance and empowering local communities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 gave a constitutional status to Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring their legal recognition and providing a framework for their organization and functioning.  This landmark amendment solidified the position of Panchayati Raj within the Indian political system.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Panchayati Raj system in India.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding District Judges:**

1. District Judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the High Court.
2.  The District and Sessions Judge works directly under the control of the High Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. District Judges are appointed by the Governor of the state, not the Chief Justice of the High Court.  The Governor exercises this power based on the recommendations of the High Court.  The inaccuracy highlights the importance of understanding the precise appointment process.

Statement 2 is correct. The District and Sessions Judge is the highest judicial officer in a district and works directly under the administrative and judicial control of the High Court of the state.  This arrangement emphasizes the High Court's role in overseeing the judiciary at the district level.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**23. With reference to the Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in the State Legislature only on the recommendation of the Governor.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Money Bill in a state legislature can only be introduced on the recommendation of the Governor. This reflects the Governor's role in ensuring that financial matters are handled according to constitutional procedures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) cannot reject a Money Bill.  While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations, it cannot veto a Money Bill. The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has exclusive power over Money Bills.  The inaccuracy highlights the distinct roles of the two Houses of Parliament regarding financial legislation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**24. Consider the following statements about the 74th Amendment Act:**

1.  The Act mandates periodic elections for municipalities every five years.
2.  The Act provides for reservation of seats for women in municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act, dealing with municipalities, mandates that elections to municipalities must be held periodically every five years. This provision ensures democratic accountability and the regular renewal of local governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 74th Amendment Act provides for the reservation of one-third of the seats in municipalities for women. This reservation aims to enhance women's political participation and representation at the local level.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe key provisions of the 74th Amendment Act.


**25. With reference to the President's Rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  President's Rule can be imposed under Article 356 of the Constitution.
2.  The imposition of President's Rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  President's Rule, also known as the imposition of the President's rule in a state, is constitutionally permitted under Article 356.  This article allows the President to take over the administration of a state if the state government is unable to function according to constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the imposition of President's Rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an automatic consequence.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President and is not a mandatory part of the process.  The inaccuracy highlights the need to understand the discretionary aspects of President's Rule.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**26. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor can exercise his executive authority only through officers subordinate to him.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  This provision reflects the hierarchical relationship between the Union and the states within the Indian federal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 154 of the Constitution states that the Governor can exercise executive authority either directly or through officers subordinate to him.  The Governor is not restricted to exercising power only through subordinate officers.  The inaccuracy highlights the need for a precise understanding of the Governor's executive powers.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**27. With reference to the ordinance-making power of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor's ordinance-making power is laid down in Article 213.
2.  An ordinance issued by the Governor has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 213 of the Constitution of India explicitly outlines the ordinance-making power of the Governor.  This power allows the Governor to promulgate ordinances when the State Legislature is not in session.  This provision is crucial for ensuring that urgent legislative action can be taken even when the legislature is not functioning.

Statement 2 is also correct. An ordinance issued by the Governor has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.  However, it is subject to certain conditions, such as the requirement that the ordinance must be approved by the State Legislature within six weeks of its reassembly.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the ordinance-making power of the Governor.


**28. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
2. The CAG has control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is constitutionally responsible only to the Parliament.  This ensures the CAG's independence and impartiality in auditing government accounts.  The CAG's accountability to Parliament reflects the importance of transparency and accountability in public finances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG does *not* have control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.  That power rests with the executive branch of the government, subject to parliamentary authorization.  The inaccuracy highlights the distinct roles of the CAG and the executive in managing public finances.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**29. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC was established by a constitutional provision.
2. The CVC's primary function is to investigate corruption cases within the central government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CVC was not established by a constitutional provision; it is a statutory body established by a resolution of the government of India.  This reflects the evolving nature of anti-corruption mechanisms and the government's authority to create such bodies through legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The CVC's primary function is to investigate and prevent corruption within the central government.  This includes monitoring the implementation of anti-corruption measures and advising government agencies on improving their integrity.  The accuracy of this statement demonstrates an understanding of the CVC's role in promoting good governance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**30. Consider the following statements regarding the Lokpal:**

1. The Lokpal Bill was first introduced in the Parliament in 1967.
2. The Lokpal is a constitutional body.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lokpal Bill was first introduced in the Parliament in 1968, not 1967.  The error in the year highlights the importance of precise chronological accuracy in understanding legislative history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lokpal is a statutory body, not a constitutional body.  It was established through legislation, not through the Constitution itself.  The inaccuracy demonstrates the need to differentiate between constitutional and statutory bodies.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate.  The Lokpal is an institution designed to investigate complaints of corruption against public officials.


**1. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that all government information should be made public unless it falls under one of the exemptions specified in the Act.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) has the power to impose penalties on public authorities for not complying with the Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Information Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation that empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities.  Statement 1 is correct because the Act operates on a presumption of disclosure, meaning information should be made public unless it falls under specific exemptions detailed in the Act. These exemptions are designed to protect sensitive information such as national security, personal privacy, and commercial confidentiality.  Statement 2 is also correct as the CIC, a statutory body, has the power to hear appeals against the decisions of public authorities and to impose penalties for non-compliance, including financial penalties and orders for providing the information.  The CIC ensures transparency and accountability in the government's functioning.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of the RTI Act’s provisions.


**2. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India, but not to the local bodies.
2.  The Election Commission resolves disputes regarding the election of the Vice-President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in the country.  Statement 1 is largely correct.  The ECI conducts elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), State Legislative Assemblies, and the President of India. However, it does not directly conduct elections to local bodies (municipalities, panchayats, etc.), which are usually conducted by State Election Commissions. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Election Commission does not have jurisdiction over disputes related to the election of the Vice-President.  Such disputes fall under the purview of the Supreme Court of India. Therefore, only statement 1 is mostly correct, albeit with the qualification regarding local body elections.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the President's rule in a state:**

1. The President can impose President's rule only on the recommendation of the Union Council of Ministers.
2.  The President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

President's rule, also known as Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the President to impose central rule in a state if the state government is unable to function constitutionally. Statement 1 is correct.  The President cannot unilaterally impose President's rule; it requires a recommendation from the Union Council of Ministers, which is responsible and accountable to the Parliament.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the State Legislative Assembly is often dissolved during President's rule, it is not an automatic consequence. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in session.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly is a political one, based on the circumstances and the assessment of the situation by the Union government. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions.


**4. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution adopts a quasi-federal system, combining elements of both federal and unitary features.
2.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India, reflecting the unitary aspect of the Indian federation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's federal structure is a unique blend of federal and unitary elements, often described as a quasi-federal system. Statement 1 is correct because the Indian Constitution, while establishing a federal framework with a division of powers between the Centre and States, also incorporates several unitary features.  For example, the Centre has significant power over the States, especially in times of emergency, and the Constitution can be amended by the Parliament without the consent of the States. Statement 2 is also correct; the Governor is appointed by the President, highlighting the Centre's influence over the States. This is a clear example of the unitary element within the federal structure. The appointment of the Governor by the President shows a significant degree of central control over the States' executive branch.  Therefore, both statements correctly reflect the dual nature of the Indian federal system.


**5. With reference to the powers of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, with a two-thirds majority.
2.  The Parliament has the power to create new All-India Services.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament of India possesses extensive legislative powers, including the power to amend the Constitution and create new All-India Services. Statement 1 is essentially correct. While the Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, there are limitations, particularly concerning the "basic structure" doctrine established by the Supreme Court.  However, with a two-thirds majority in both Houses and the President's assent, the Parliament can effect significant constitutional changes. Statement 2 is also correct; the Parliament has the power to create new All-India Services under Article 312 of the Constitution.  This power allows the Parliament to establish services that are common to the entire nation, ensuring uniformity and efficiency in administration.  Therefore, both statements correctly reflect the Parliament's significant legislative capabilities.



**6. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judicial System:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the final arbiter of constitutional disputes and has the power of judicial review.
2.  High Courts in India have original jurisdiction in some matters and appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts within their respective states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian judicial system is a hierarchical structure with the Supreme Court at its apex. Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in India and has the power of judicial review, meaning it can declare laws and government actions unconstitutional if they violate the Constitution.  This is a crucial aspect of India’s system of checks and balances. Statement 2 is also correct. High Courts in India exercise both original and appellate jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction means they can hear cases directly, without any prior court hearing them.  Appellate jurisdiction means they can hear appeals against the decisions of subordinate courts within their state.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe key features of the Indian judicial system.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, but not those of local bodies.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the government's accounts.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG is appointed by the President, the CAG holds office for a fixed term and can only be removed through impeachment. The  CAG enjoys considerable independence from the executive branch. Statement 2 is largely correct. The CAG audits the accounts relating to the receipts and expenditure of the Union and State Governments.  However, the scope of the CAG's audit does not typically extend to local bodies (municipalities and panchayats), which are usually audited by local government audit bodies. While there might be some overlap or specific instances where the CAG might be involved,  it is not the primary auditor for local bodies.  Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially correct.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission of India:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.
2. The Finance Commission’s recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in India's federal financial system. Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Finance Commission every five years to review the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and States.  The commission’s composition and the terms of reference are laid down in the Constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and usually followed, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  The government has the discretion to accept or reject the recommendations, although doing so would require strong justification.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the Finance Commission's constitutional mandate.


**9. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of PRIs in all states.
2.  PRIs are empowered to levy taxes and collect revenues.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions, aiming to decentralize power and improve local governance. Statement 1 is correct. The Act mandates a three-tier system of PRIs – Gram Panchayats at the village level, Panchayat Samitis at the intermediate level, and Zila Parishads at the district level. However, the specific structure might differ slightly based on the state's specific context and population. Statement 2 is also correct.  PRIs are granted the power to levy taxes and collect revenues to fund their local development activities. The specific types of taxes they can levy may vary according to state laws, but this power is a central aspect of their financial autonomy. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the key features of PRIs as established by the 73rd Amendment.


**10. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor is the constitutional head of a State in India. Statement 1 is correct. The Governor is appointed by the President and holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  However, this power is rarely used and is generally exercised only in exceptional circumstances. Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.  However, the Governor also has discretionary powers in certain situations, such as when there is no clear majority in the Assembly or during a constitutional crisis.  Therefore, both statements are valid descriptions of the Governor's role and powers.


**11.  Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination and recruiting officers for various central government services.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President but are not removable except by the process of impeachment.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The UPSC is a crucial constitutional body responsible for recruitment to various central government services. Statement 1 is correct.  The UPSC conducts the Civil Services Examination, which is one of the most prestigious and competitive examinations in India, to recruit officers for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), and many other central services.  It also conducts recruitment examinations for other government positions. Statement 2 is also correct. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President, but their security of tenure is protected by the Constitution. They are not removable except by the process of impeachment for proven misbehavior or incapacity. This independence is vital to ensure impartiality and fairness in recruitment processes.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the UPSC's role and constitutional safeguards.


**12. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable in courts of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are a set of guidelines enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct.  The Directive Principles are not directly enforceable in courts; they are not legally binding on the government.  However, they serve as guiding principles for the government's policy-making and are considered important for achieving social and economic justice. Statement 2 is also correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic equality, protecting the weaker sections, and ensuring a high standard of living for all citizens. They guide the government to strive towards creating a just and equitable society, even though they lack immediate legal enforceability.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the nature and objectives of the Directive Principles.


**13.  Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Rights:**

1. Fundamental Rights are justiciable and can be enforced in courts of law.
2.  The Right to Property was originally a Fundamental Right but was removed from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th Amendment Act.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are the basic human rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct.  Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced in courts of law.  If a citizen believes that their Fundamental Rights have been violated, they can approach the court for redressal. The courts have the power to issue orders or writs to protect these rights. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Right to Property was originally included in the list of Fundamental Rights, but it was removed from this list by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.  However, it continues to exist as a Constitutional Right under Article 300A.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the nature and evolution of Fundamental Rights in India.


**14. With reference to the Parliament’s power to legislate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List if a resolution is passed by both Houses declaring that it is in the national interest.
2.  Parliament has exclusive power to legislate on subjects in the Union List.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution divides legislative powers between the Union and State Governments through three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. Statement 1 is correct. In exceptional circumstances, Parliament can legislate on subjects within the State List if both Houses pass a resolution declaring that such legislation is in the national interest. This provision allows the Centre to intervene in areas that affect the nation as a whole, even if they are primarily within the States' purview. This reflects the  unitary features within the Indian federal system. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Union List contains subjects on which only the Parliament can legislate.  These are areas of national importance such as defense, foreign affairs, currency, and communications.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe the Parliament's legislative powers as per the distribution of power in the Constitution.


**15. Consider the following statements related to the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Parliament and is directly elected by the people.
2. The Lok Sabha can be dissolved by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Indian Parliament and holds significant power in the legislative process. Statement 1 is correct.  The Lok Sabha is directly elected by the people of India through adult suffrage.  It represents the people's will and is the more powerful house of Parliament.  Its strength is larger than that of Rajya Sabha, making it the dominant house. Statement 2 is also correct. The Lok Sabha can be dissolved by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.  This is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system, allowing the executive to seek a fresh mandate from the people if it loses confidence in the Lok Sabha. Therefore, both statements are accurate descriptions of the Lok Sabha's nature and functioning.


**16. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the Parliament and represents the States.
2.  The Rajya Sabha cannot be dissolved; its members serve six-year terms, with one-third retiring every two years.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the Indian Parliament and plays a crucial role in the legislative process. Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha represents the States; its members are elected by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies.  It provides a voice for the States in national legislation. Statement 2 is also correct.  Unlike the Lok Sabha, which can be dissolved, the Rajya Sabha is a permanent body.  Members of the Rajya Sabha serve six-year terms, with one-third of the members retiring every two years, ensuring continuity and experience in the upper house. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the Rajya Sabha's unique features and composition.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.
2.  The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament before it can be implemented.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial document that outlines the government's financial plans for the upcoming fiscal year. Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister, who is responsible for its preparation and implementation. The budget lays out the government’s planned expenditure and revenue for the year.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Union Budget must be approved by both Houses of Parliament – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha – before it can be implemented. While the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill, it can still suggest changes, and these suggestions are generally considered by the Lok Sabha. The budget is a crucial component of the government's governance and needs parliamentary approval. Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**18. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC is a statutory body established to protect and promote human rights in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is not a constitutional body; it is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament – the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  While its functions are crucial for upholding human rights, it does not have a constitutional basis like the Election Commission or the Supreme Court. Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC has the power to investigate allegations of human rights violations and to recommend remedial action to the government.  Its recommendations are not legally binding, but they carry significant moral weight and usually influence government action.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General has the right of audience in all courts in India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Attorney General of India is the highest law officer of the country. Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Attorney General advises the government on legal matters and represents the government in courts. Statement 2 is also correct. The Attorney General has the right of audience in all courts in India, meaning they can appear and argue cases before any court in the country.  This right reflects their high status and expertise in legal matters.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**20. With reference to the concept of "Basic Structure" of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of "Basic Structure" was developed by the Supreme Court to limit the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2.  The "Basic Structure" doctrine prevents the Parliament from amending any part of the Constitution.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The "Basic Structure" doctrine is a landmark judicial pronouncement that protects the fundamental features of the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct. The concept of "Basic Structure" was judicially evolved by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973).  The Court held that while the Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its basic structure or fundamental features. This limits the Parliament's amending power to prevent it from fundamentally altering the character of the Constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The "Basic Structure" doctrine does not prevent the Parliament from amending *any* part of the Constitution.  It only prevents amendments that destroy or damage the basic and essential features of the Constitution, such as the fundamental rights, federalism, secularism, and the rule of law.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the essence of the "Basic Structure" doctrine.



**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Union Territories in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists (Union, State, Concurrent) in relation to the Union Territories.
2.  The executive head of a Union Territory is always designated as the Lieutenant Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution grants Parliament the power to legislate on all subjects for Union Territories.  This is a significant departure from the federal principle of divided powers applicable to states.  The Union List, State List, and Concurrent List distinctions do not strictly apply to Union Territories, giving the central government greater control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Lieutenant Governor is a common designation for the executive head of a Union Territory, it's not the only one.  Some Union Territories may have an Administrator or a Chief Commissioner as their executive head, depending on the specific provisions laid down by Parliament for the administration of that particular territory. The designation is determined by the specific administrative structure established by Parliament for each Union Territory and can vary.


**2. With reference to the composition and powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can introduce and pass any type of bill, including Money Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not possess the power to reject a Money Bill. While it can review a Money Bill and suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these suggestions.  The Lok Sabha's decision on a Money Bill is final.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot introduce Money Bills; this power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can, however, discuss and amend Money Bills but cannot reject them.


**3.  With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by outlining the socio-economic goals the state should strive for.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable.  They are not legally enforceable in courts; however, they serve as guidelines for the government to frame its policies and legislation. The courts cannot compel the government to implement them.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs are a set of guiding principles intended to ensure social and economic justice. They aim to create a welfare state that addresses issues like poverty, inequality, and social welfare.  They provide a framework for socio-economic development and are an important part of India's constitutional ethos, even if not directly enforceable.


**4. With reference to the Emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can declare a National Emergency only on the basis of a report from the Supreme Court.
2.  During a National Emergency, the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are automatically suspended.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President declares a National Emergency based on a written recommendation from the Cabinet, not the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court may play a role in adjudicating challenges to the declaration's legality but doesn't initiate it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President can suspend some fundamental rights during a National Emergency under Article 359,  it does not automatically suspend all fundamental rights. The suspension of rights is selective and subject to certain limitations and judicial review.


**5. With reference to the powers and functions of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President and holds office during the pleasure of the Prime Minister.
2.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor is appointed by the President, but holds office during the pleasure of the President, not the Prime Minister.  This signifies the Governor's position as a representative of the Union government within the State.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor possesses the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, although this power is usually exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister.  However, in exceptional circumstances, the Governor may use their discretion.


**6. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission is appointed by the President every five years.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Central and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Finance Commission every five years or as needed, to review and recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the Central and State governments.  The government can consider and accept or reject these recommendations, but the government's decision is final.


**7. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates direct elections for all the PRIs at all three levels.
2. The PRIs are empowered to levy and collect certain taxes and duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act mandates elections for PRIs, it doesn't specify that all elections must be direct.  The Act allows for indirect elections of chairpersons at the intermediate and district levels in certain cases.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act empowers PRIs to levy and collect certain taxes and duties, providing them with a degree of financial autonomy.  This is crucial for their effective functioning and ability to carry out their responsibilities.


**8. With reference to the features of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution is a federal Constitution with a unitary bias.
2. The Indian Constitution adopts a system of dual citizenship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is a federation, but it leans towards a unitary system,  with a strong central government having significant powers over the states. This is evident in the distribution of powers, emergency provisions, and the overall structure of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India has a single citizenship system.  There is only one citizenship: Indian citizenship.  There's no separate state citizenship as seen in some other federal systems.  All citizens have the same rights and obligations across the country.


**9. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Parliament.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Central Government and not the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President and is an independent constitutional authority responsible to the Parliament.  They audit the accounts of the Central and State governments and various other public bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Central and State Governments.  The CAG plays a vital role in ensuring financial accountability and transparency within the Indian governmental structure at both the Union and State levels.


**10. With reference to the appointment of ministers at the Union level, consider the following statements:**

1. Ministers at the Union level are appointed by the President.
2. Ministers at the Union level are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Although the President formally appoints the ministers,  this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The President acts as a constitutional head, while the Prime Minister and their Council of Ministers are the real executive authority.

Statement 2 is correct. Ministers are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.  This means that if the Lok Sabha expresses its lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers (through a no-confidence motion), the entire government must resign.  This is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system of government in India.


**11. With reference to the process of law-making in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha.
2. The President can withhold assent to a Money Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. This is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system designed to ensure the lower house retains primary control over financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the President has the power to withhold assent to most bills, they do not have this power in the case of Money Bills. Once a Money Bill is passed by both houses (with the Lok Sabha's decision being final), the President must give their assent.


**12. With reference to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Equality prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any fundamental right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 32 of the Constitution guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any fundamental right. This is considered a crucial safeguard to ensure the effectiveness of fundamental rights.  This right is itself a fundamental right.


**13. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs and STs), consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India has the power to specify which castes or tribes are to be included in the list of SCs and STs.
2. Reservation for SCs and STs in the services and posts is based on the principle of proportional representation to their population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution empowers the President to specify the castes and tribes to be included in the list of SCs and STs, in consultation with the Governors of the respective states.  This reflects the need for flexibility in addressing the specific needs of different regions and populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While reservation aims to provide representation, it isn't strictly proportional to the population.  The actual percentage of reservation may vary based on various factors and government policies, and is subject to review and modification over time.  The goal is to provide adequate representation and opportunity while maintaining administrative efficiency.


**14. With reference to the structure of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent House, while the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution.
2. The Rajya Sabha represents the states, while the Lok Sabha represents the people of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) is a continuing body, with only one-third of its members retiring every two years.  The Lok Sabha (House of the People), on the other hand, is subject to dissolution after a maximum period of five years or earlier on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha represents the states of India, with members elected by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies. The Lok Sabha represents the people of India, with members directly elected by the people of their respective constituencies.  This bicameral structure helps to balance the representation of states and the people as a whole.


**15. With reference to the judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The power of judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court can declare a law passed by Parliament as unconstitutional.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The power of judicial review is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. It's a power that the Supreme Court has asserted and established through its interpretation of the Constitution.  This power is considered essential for upholding the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review and can declare any law passed by Parliament or any state legislature as unconstitutional if it violates the provisions of the Constitution. This power is a cornerstone of India's judicial system and ensures the Constitution's supremacy.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976, added the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble.
2. The Kesavananda Bharati case established the doctrine of basic structure, limiting the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble by incorporating the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," reflecting the changing socio-political landscape of India.  This amendment aimed to explicitly enshrine the socialist and secular ideals that had been guiding the nation's policies since independence. The addition of "Integrity" further emphasized the importance of national unity and cohesion.

Statement 2 is also correct. The landmark Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case established the doctrine of "basic structure," a crucial concept in Indian constitutional law.  The Supreme Court ruled that while Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental features or "basic structure." This judgment significantly limits the extent of Parliament's amending power, safeguarding the core principles of the Constitution.  Subsequent cases have further refined the understanding and application of this doctrine.  The basic structure doctrine is a vital check on the amending power, ensuring that the fundamental principles of the Constitution remain inviolate.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was repealed in 2019.
2.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts respectively provided for Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which provided special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, was revoked in August 2019 by a Presidential Order. This decision ended the state's special status and integrated it fully into the Indian Union. The revocation was a significant political event, leading to considerable debate and discussion.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 introduced the three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate, and district levels, giving constitutional status to local self-governance in rural areas. Similarly, the 74th Amendment Act of 1992 provided for the establishment of Municipalities at different levels in urban areas, aiming to improve urban governance and citizen participation.  These amendments represent a substantial step towards decentralization of power in India.


**3. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. Residuary powers are vested with the Union Government.
2. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution vests residuary powers—powers not explicitly assigned to either the Union or the States—with the Union Government. This provision reflects the unitary bias inherent in the Indian federal structure, ensuring that the central government retains control over matters not specifically mentioned in the lists of powers allocated to the states.  This arrangement has been a source of both strength and contention in the Indian federal system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President of India appoints the Governors of the states. While the Governors are the constitutional heads of the states, they are appointed by the central government, reflecting the centralizing tendency of the Indian federal structure. The appointment of Governors by the President ensures that the central government has a degree of influence over the states' administration.  The role and powers of the Governor have been a subject of debate and judicial scrutiny.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Parliament.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of certain other bodies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India, an independent constitutional authority, is appointed by the President of India.  However, the CAG's primary responsibility is to the Parliament, to which the CAG submits audit reports. This ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch and maintains its accountability to the legislature. The CAG's independence is a crucial aspect of maintaining financial probity within the government.

Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's audit extends to not only the revenue and expenditure accounts of the governments but also to various other public authorities and bodies, including those receiving government grants or funds.  The CAG's role is vital for maintaining transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule protects laws included in it from judicial review.
2.  The Tenth Schedule deals with disqualification on grounds of defection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution was initially designed to protect certain laws from judicial review.  However, the Supreme Court's decision in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* (2007) significantly curtailed this protection, ruling that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate fundamental rights. While laws added before this date might still enjoy some protection, the scope of the Ninth Schedule's immunity from judicial scrutiny has been greatly reduced.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, added by the 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1985 (also known as the Anti-Defection Law), deals with the disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on grounds of defection.  It aims to prevent legislators from changing parties for personal gain, promoting political stability.  The provisions of the Tenth Schedule have been a subject of considerable legal and political debate.


**6. With reference to the Union Territories in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Parliament has the power to make laws on any subject for Union Territories.
2. The administrator of a Union Territory is appointed by the President.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution grants Parliament the power to make laws for the Union Territories.  This is in contrast to states, which have their own legislative assemblies with powers over matters listed in the State List.  The Union government's greater control over Union Territories reflects their status as territories directly under the central government's administration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President of India appoints the administrator of a Union Territory. The administrator's designation and powers may vary depending on the specific Union Territory's constitutional status. Some Union Territories have a Lieutenant Governor, while others have an Administrator or Chief Commissioner. The appointment of the administrator by the President underscores the central government's direct control over these territories.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Scheduled and Tribal Areas in India:**

1. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with Scheduled Areas in all states of India.
2. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution provides for autonomous district councils in four Northeastern states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states *except* Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. These four states have a separate administrative arrangement under the Sixth Schedule.  The Fifth Schedule provisions are designed to protect the interests of tribal populations and ensure their welfare.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution establishes a special administrative system for tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It provides for the creation of autonomous district councils and regional councils to govern these areas, granting them significant autonomy in matters of local governance. The Sixth Schedule recognizes the unique cultural and administrative needs of the tribal populations in these Northeastern states.


**8. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
2. The President can be removed from office through impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. This is a crucial constitutional provision, vesting ultimate authority over the military in the head of state. This authority is largely ceremonial in nature, with the actual operational control resting with the Defence Ministry and the Chief of Defence Staff. However, the constitutional position of the President as Supreme Commander underscores the civilian control over the military.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President of India can be removed from office through a process of impeachment.  This process, outlined in the Constitution, requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament.  Impeachment proceedings are initiated by a resolution in either House, and the President is removed if the resolution is passed by a two-thirds majority in each House.  Impeachment is a rigorous process, designed to ensure that only serious misconduct justifies the removal of the President.


**9. With reference to the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the Prime Minister is the de facto head of the government, the President formally appoints the Prime Minister.  The President usually appoints the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). This constitutional provision maintains a formal distinction between the head of state (President) and the head of government (Prime Minister).

Statement 2 is also correct. The Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers, which comprises all the ministers who are part of the government. The Prime Minister presides over Cabinet meetings, coordinates the work of the various ministries, and leads the government's overall policy agenda.  The Prime Minister's position at the head of the Council of Ministers is crucial for the effective functioning of the executive branch.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliament:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate money bills.
2. The Lok Sabha has the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money bills, which deal primarily with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). The Rajya Sabha (the upper house) can only review and make recommendations on money bills, but it cannot initiate them.  This provision ensures that the Lok Sabha, which represents the people more directly, retains primary control over financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha has the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.  If a no-confidence motion is passed by a simple majority in the Lok Sabha, the Council of Ministers is constitutionally obligated to resign.  This mechanism is a crucial aspect of parliamentary accountability, ensuring that the executive branch remains responsible to the legislature.  The no-confidence motion is a powerful tool for the opposition to challenge the government.


**11. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and the States.
2. The Supreme Court can review its own judgments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Union Government and one or more States, or between two or more States.  This original jurisdiction is explicitly granted by the Constitution and reflects the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of inter-state and Centre-state disputes.  This jurisdiction is crucial for maintaining federal balance and resolving constitutional conflicts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgments.  While this power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, it allows the Supreme Court to correct errors or adapt its jurisprudence to changing societal needs.  The power of judicial review, including the ability to review its own judgments, is a fundamental aspect of the Supreme Court's role in maintaining the rule of law.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President.
2. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. This appointment reflects the central government's influence over state-level governance. The appointment process itself is not subject to detailed constitutional provisions but is usually based on recommendations from the central government.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration. This power is typically exercised with respect to bills that raise questions of national importance or potentially infringe upon Union jurisdiction.  The Governor’s power of reservation serves as a check on the State Legislature and safeguards the overall unity and integrity of the nation.


**13. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission conducts elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Election Commission of India was initially a multi-member body, it currently comprises a single Chief Election Commissioner.  The current structure aims to enhance the Commission's decision-making efficiency and avoid potential divisions amongst multiple members.  The single Chief Election Commissioner model is designed to ensure greater autonomy and impartiality.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.  The Commission's role is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the democratic process and ensuring that elections are conducted according to constitutional provisions.  The Commission's independence is vital for ensuring the credibility of elections.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Finance Commission of India:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India constitutes the Finance Commission every five years, or as needed, to review the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State Governments. The Commission's composition includes a Chairman and four other members, with expertise in finance, economics, and related fields.  The President's role underscores the importance of the Commission in maintaining fiscal balance within the federal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are given considerable weight and influence, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  The government may accept or reject the recommendations, but it must present its reasons to the Parliament for any deviations.  The government's ability to deviate from the Commission's recommendations, however, is subject to political and public scrutiny.


**15. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable in nature.
2. They aim to promote social and economic welfare.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  They are, however, fundamental in the governance of the country and serve as guidelines for the government to formulate policies aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles allows for flexibility in policy implementation and prevents judicial interference in policy choices.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy are intended to guide the government in creating a just and equitable society. They focus on promoting social and economic welfare, including aspects such as providing education, healthcare, and social security, and improving working conditions.  These principles are aspirational goals that the government strives to achieve through its policies and actions.  They are a crucial aspect of the Constitution’s commitment to social justice.


**16. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. Right to property is a fundamental right.
2. Right to education is a fundamental right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Property, which was initially a Fundamental Right, was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. It is now a legal right under Article 300-A, included in Part XII of the Constitution. This change reflects a shift in the government's approach to property rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, made free and compulsory education a fundamental right for children aged 6-14 years.  This Act is a landmark achievement in ensuring the right to education for all children, aligning with the Constitution’s broader commitment to social justice and equality.  The inclusion of the Right to Education as a fundamental right has far-reaching implications for educational policy and implementation.


**17. Consider the following statements about the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually in Parliament.
2. The Union Budget includes both revenue and expenditure estimates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented annually in the Parliament, typically in February, by the Union Finance Minister.  This presentation is a significant event in the Indian political calendar, setting the government's financial priorities for the coming year.  The Budget is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and debate before being passed into law.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Union Budget encompasses both revenue and expenditure estimates.  The revenue section details the government's expected income from various sources, such as taxes, while the expenditure section outlines planned government spending on different programs and initiatives.  The Budget reflects the government's economic policies and priorities. The balance between revenue and expenditure is a crucial aspect of fiscal management.


**18. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a statutory body.
2. The NGT deals exclusively with environmental cases.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, making it a statutory body. It is a specialized body dedicated to addressing environmental issues and reducing the burden on higher courts.  The NGT's establishment reflects the growing importance of environmental concerns in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NGT primarily handles environmental disputes, its jurisdiction is not exclusively limited to environmental cases. It can also address cases related to other matters that have significant environmental implications.  The NGT's broader jurisdiction allows it to deal with the complex interlinkages between environmental issues and other aspects of development and governance.  The NGT's functioning is an evolving process, with its powers and scope continuously being shaped by judicial pronouncements and legislative amendments.



**1. With reference to the Union Budget of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India is authorized to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for expenditure charged upon it.
2.  The Lok Sabha alone possesses the power to vote on demands for grants included in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Union Budget, and Article 265 mentions that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. The President's authority to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for expenditure charged upon it is a crucial aspect of the budgetary process. This expenditure doesn't require the Parliament's vote. This is a significant feature of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting the balance of power between the executive and the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, holds the primary power over financial matters.  The demands for grants, which detail the government's proposed expenditure, are presented to the Lok Sabha for its approval. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, can only make recommendations but cannot reject a money bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over the purse strings of the government, a key element of democratic accountability in a parliamentary system.  The power to vote on demands for grants is a critical aspect of parliamentary control over government spending.


**2. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can issue ordinances only when Parliament is not in session.
2. An ordinance issued by the President ceases to operate six months after its promulgation unless replaced by a law passed by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's ordinance-making power is primarily exercised when Parliament is not in session,  it is not strictly limited to such situations. The Constitution (Article 123) allows the President to promulgate ordinances even when Parliament is in session if there is an urgent need for immediate legislative action. The circumstances are considered by the President, and the power is not absolute.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 123(2)(a) clearly states that an ordinance issued by the President will cease to operate six months after its promulgation unless approved by Parliament. The six-month period is crucial as it provides a time frame for Parliament to convert the ordinance into a proper law. If Parliament fails to act within this period, the ordinance lapses. This provision ensures that the executive's ordinance-making power is not used to bypass the legislative process indefinitely. The time limit also prevents the executive from exceeding its authority.


**3. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State governments.
2. The Finance Commission is constituted every five years to review the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight and are usually accepted by the government, they are not legally binding.  The government can choose to accept or reject the recommendations, though it usually explains its reasons for doing so.  The non-binding nature allows for flexibility and consideration of unforeseen circumstances.  The government is accountable to Parliament for its financial decisions, including those related to the Finance Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission every five years or earlier as deemed necessary. The Commission's primary function is to review the financial position of the Union and the States and recommend the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and the grant-in-aid to States. This ensures a periodic review of the financial arrangements between the Union and States, fostering fiscal balance and equity. The five-year cycle allows for adjustments based on evolving economic conditions.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced provincial autonomy, abolishing dyarchy in the provinces.
2. It established a bicameral legislature at the centre, consisting of the Council of State and the Federal Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, marked a significant shift in the governance structure of British India by introducing provincial autonomy.  It replaced the earlier dyarchical system, which involved a division of powers between Indian ministers and British officials, with a system where provinces had greater self-governance.  This was a crucial step toward greater Indian participation in the administration.  The Act aimed to grant more power to provincial legislatures and elected officials.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act established a federal structure with a bicameral legislature at the centre. The upper house was the Council of State, and the lower house was the Federal Assembly. This reflected an attempt to create a more representative and structured legislative system.  The bicameral structure provided a check and balance mechanism, a common feature of many modern parliamentary systems.  The Council of State was to have nominated and elected members, while the Federal Assembly was to have mostly elected members.


**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG submits audit reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President of India, but the term is for six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The constitutional provisions ensure the independence and security of tenure for the CAG, allowing them to perform their duties without political influence. The age limit safeguards against the potential for extended periods of service.  The appointment process ensures the selection of a qualified individual.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG’s audit reports are submitted to the President, who then presents them to both houses of Parliament. This ensures that Parliament is informed about the financial management of government funds and promotes accountability and transparency. The reports cover the accounts of the Union and State governments, as well as other public bodies.  The process ensures that Parliament can scrutinize government finances and hold the executive accountable.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2. They aim to establish a social and economic democracy in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, are not justiciable.  This means they are not directly enforceable in courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies and legislation promoting social and economic welfare.  The non-justiciable nature reflects the balance between individual rights and societal goals. The courts can't compel the government to implement them.


Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to create a social and economic democracy by promoting social justice, economic equality, and welfare measures. They incorporate ideals such as a living wage, equal pay for equal work, and the right to work.  These principles are meant to guide the state in creating a more just and equitable society, though not through direct judicial enforcement. They represent the social and economic vision of the Constitution.


**7. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2.  The Ninth Schedule was initially created to protect land reforms legislation from judicial challenge.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While initially, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court's decision in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* (2007) reversed this position. The court ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial scrutiny.  This means that courts can examine their constitutionality. The Supreme Court's decision aimed to balance the need for legislative flexibility with the protection of fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was introduced through the First Amendment Act of 1951, primarily to protect land reform legislation from legal challenges.  These laws were often challenged on grounds of violating fundamental rights, such as the right to property.  Placing them in the Ninth Schedule aimed to prevent such challenges, thereby allowing the government to implement its land reforms agenda. The rationale was to expedite social and economic reforms.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the features of the Indian Federal System:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, with a strong central government.
2.  The distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States is based on a three-fold division—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian federal system is often described as quasi-federal or federal with a centralizing tendency.  While it features elements of federalism, such as a written constitution, division of powers, and an independent judiciary, the central government possesses significant power and influence.  This is evident in the Union's control over several crucial areas, the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, and the presence of All-India Services. The balance of power leans towards the Centre.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States is a defining feature of Indian federalism.  It is based on the three lists—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List contains subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government; the State List covers subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of State governments; and the Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Union and State governments can legislate.  This division of powers is crucial to maintaining the balance between the Centre and the States.  The residuary powers also vest with the Union, which further strengthens the Centre.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The right to constitutional remedies is a crucial Fundamental Right that allows citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed under the Constitution, are not absolute.  They can be subjected to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the public order, morality, health, etc.  The Supreme Court has often interpreted and applied these restrictions, balancing individual rights with societal needs. The limitations reflect a practical approach to governance. The courts determine the reasonableness of restrictions.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 32, which guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, is a cornerstone of the protection of Fundamental Rights.  It allows citizens to directly approach the Supreme Court to enforce their rights if they are violated.  This right is considered crucial for the effective protection of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review to determine the validity of laws.  The right to move the court is a powerful tool for citizens.


**10. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in financial matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Parliament follows a bicameral system, comprising the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  This structure reflects a balance of power and representation. The Lok Sabha represents the people directly, while the Rajya Sabha represents the states.  The bicameral structure is a common feature of many parliamentary democracies.  Both houses play significant roles in legislation.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lok Sabha holds greater power than the Rajya Sabha in financial matters.  Money Bills, which deal with taxation and government expenditure, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations, it cannot reject or amend a Money Bill. This reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected house. The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily advisory in this respect.




**1. With reference to the National Social Assistance Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily fulfills the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
2.  The programme significantly contributes to the fulfillment of Fundamental Rights, particularly the right to life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) aims to provide social security and poverty alleviation to vulnerable sections of society.  While it doesn't directly enforce Fundamental Rights, its focus on providing basic necessities like food and financial assistance indirectly contributes to the right to life (Article 21), which is a Fundamental Right.  More importantly, the NSAP's core objectives align strongly with the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which guide the state towards social and economic justice.  The DPSPs emphasize the state's responsibility to ensure adequate means of livelihood, reduce inequalities, and provide social security, all of which the NSAP actively seeks to achieve.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are correct, although the connection between NSAP and Fundamental Rights is indirect and primarily realized through the fulfillment of DPSPs.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present only one aspect of the program's impact. Option (d) is incorrect as the NSAP clearly aligns with both Fundamental Rights and DPSPs, albeit in different ways.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's advisory role, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can offer advice to the President on matters of law or fact only upon the President's request.
2. The Supreme Court's advisory opinion is binding on the President and the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India has an advisory jurisdiction (Article 143). This allows the President to consult the court on any question of law or fact.  However, this is solely at the President's discretion; the court cannot initiate such advice.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this aspect of the Supreme Court's advisory role. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court's opinion carries significant weight, it is not legally binding on the President or the government.  The President and the executive remain free to accept or reject the advice provided.  The advisory opinion serves as a valuable source of legal expertise and guidance, but its acceptance is ultimately a matter of political judgment. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the nature of the Supreme Court's advisory power or inaccurately describe the binding nature of its advisory opinions.


**3. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats primarily deal with civil disputes and cannot handle criminal cases.
2.  Lok Adalats can only address matters that are already pending before a court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lok Adalats are informal dispute resolution mechanisms aimed at providing speedy and cost-effective justice.  They primarily focus on civil disputes, such as property disputes, family matters, and consumer complaints.  Their jurisdiction does not extend to criminal cases.  Thus, statement 1 is correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Lok Adalats can deal with pre-litigative matters (disputes that have not yet reached a court) as well as cases that are pending before a court.  The aim is to resolve disputes outside the formal court system, thereby reducing the burden on the judiciary.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope of Lok Adalats' jurisdiction and the types of cases they can handle.


**4. With reference to the "Instrument of Instructions" from the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. These instructions were incorporated into the Constitution of India as Fundamental Rights.
2.  These instructions primarily dealt with the conduct of the Governor-General's business.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 included a set of "Instrument of Instructions" that provided guidance to the Governor-General on matters of governance.  These instructions were largely aspirational and non-justiciable.  They were not directly incorporated into the Fundamental Rights section of the Constitution.  Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, many of the instructions did relate to the Governor-General's conduct of business, including matters related to the executive council, legislation, and administrative practices. This aligns with statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the fate of the "Instrument of Instructions" in the Indian Constitution or incorrectly link them to Fundamental Rights.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is responsible for laying the Finance Commission's recommendations before Parliament.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is a constitutional body (Article 280) that makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and State Governments.  While the Union Finance Minister plays a crucial role in the process, it is the President who is constitutionally mandated to lay the Commission's recommendations before both Houses of Parliament.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding. They are advisory in nature, although they carry significant weight and are generally accepted by the government. The government is free to accept or reject the recommendations, but it must explain its reasons for not accepting any recommendation. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the constitutional position of the Finance Commission's recommendations and their binding nature on the government.


**6. With reference to the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Expenditure is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial financial document presented annually to the Parliament. While several departments contribute to its preparation, the Department of Expenditure is not the primary agency responsible for its preparation.  The Department of Economic Affairs plays a more significant role in the formulation of the budget's overall economic strategy and fiscal policy.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. However, the Union Budget is always presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister. This is a well-established constitutional convention. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly identify the primary agency responsible for budget preparation or misrepresent the constitutional procedure for budget presentation.


**7. With reference to the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, consider the following statements:**

1. This policy applies only to individuals displaced due to land acquisition for projects.
2. The Ministry of Rural Development formulated this policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, aims to provide a framework for rehabilitating and resettling individuals displaced due to various developmental projects.  It's not limited only to land acquisition for projects; it also considers displacement due to other reasons, such as dam construction, mining, and infrastructure projects. This makes statement 1 incorrect.  Further, the policy was formulated by the Ministry of Rural Development and not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the scope of the policy or the ministry responsible for its formulation.


**8. With reference to the Consumer Disputes Redressal at the district level in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The District Forum entertains complaints where the value of goods or services exceeds rupees one crore.
2. A complaint can be filed with a District Forum by any consumer, regardless of their location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Consumer Protection Act establishes a three-tier system of consumer redressal, with District Forums at the bottom.  The monetary limit for complaints handled by District Forums is rupees one crore and not rupees fifty lakhs.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Furthermore, a complaint can only be filed at the District Forum that has jurisdiction over the area where the consumer resides.  Complaints cannot be filed in any District Forum regardless of the consumer's location. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the monetary limits for complaints at the District Forum and the rules for filing complaints.


**9. With reference to the authority recommending tax principles for Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Finance Commission makes recommendations to the Governor on tax principles for Panchayats.
2.  District Planning Committees have the sole authority to determine tax principles for Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution (73rd Amendment Act) mandates the establishment of State Finance Commissions.  These commissions are responsible for making recommendations to the Governor on matters related to the devolution of funds and the determination of tax principles for Panchayats.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  District Planning Committees play a role in local planning, but they do not have the authority to determine tax principles for Panchayats.  This is the exclusive purview of the State Finance Commission.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of the State Finance Commission or incorrectly assign the function to the District Planning Committees.


**10. With reference to taxes on stock exchange transactions, consider the following statements:**

1. These taxes are levied by the Union Government.
2. The State Governments collect these taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Taxes on transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets are primarily levied by the Union Government.  While states may collect some related taxes, the primary tax is levied at the Union level.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Union Government has the primary authority to levy taxes on these transactions, although there might be some indirect state-level taxes related to the overall revenue generation from such transactions. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the primary taxing authority or inaccurately describe the tax collection mechanism.


**11. With reference to the Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act, 1992, consider the following statements:**

1. It only provides for the constitution of District Planning Committees.
2. It mandates the establishment of State Election Commissions to conduct Panchayat elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act, which deals with Panchayati Raj institutions, includes provisions for several key features, including the constitution of District Planning Committees and the establishment of State Election Commissions to conduct Panchayat elections.  While statement 1 is partially true (it does provide for District Planning Committees), it does not capture the full scope of the Act's provisions. The Act's primary aim is to provide a constitutional framework for Panchayati Raj institutions and thus it also deals with the establishment of State Finance Commissions and other vital aspects of the Panchayati Raj system. Therefore, statement 1 is not fully true and is not the best explanation. Statement 2 is more accurate as the establishment of State Election Commissions is a crucial part of ensuring free and fair elections. Hence, statement 2 is a more appropriate answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the act's scope or incorrectly focus on only one aspect of the amendment.


**12. With reference to the benefits available to religious minorities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India automatically nominates a representative of each national minority community to the Lok Sabha.
2. National minority status allows the establishment and administration of exclusive educational institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution guarantees certain rights to minorities, including the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.  This right is not contingent upon the declaration of a community as a national minority.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's power to nominate members to the Rajya Sabha does not automatically apply to national minority communities; it is based on special representation.  The nomination to Lok Sabha is not done automatically for any minority community. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional safeguards granted to religious minorities.


**13. With reference to the benefits available to persons with disabilities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preferential allotment of land for setting up businesses is a legally guaranteed benefit.
2. Free schooling until the age of 18 is a legally guaranteed benefit for persons with disabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides several benefits to persons with disabilities.  The act mandates free education up to the age of 18. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the government may offer various schemes for promoting entrepreneurship among persons with disabilities, a preferential allotment of land is not a legally guaranteed benefit under the Act.  The Act focuses on providing equal opportunities rather than preferential treatment. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the extent of legally guaranteed benefits or incorrectly assume a preferential land allotment is legally mandated.


**14. With reference to the authorization for fund withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prime Minister authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. The Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary repository of government revenues.  Withdrawals from this fund require the explicit authorization of Parliament. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary financial control.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prime Minister does not directly authorize withdrawals; it's the Parliament that grants such authorization through the appropriation bills. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the process of authorizing fund withdrawals or incorrectly assign authorization powers to the Prime Minister.


**15. With reference to the revenues of the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Contingency Fund of India.
2.  The Public Account holds revenues received by the Union Government for specific purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Government's revenues are categorized into two main accounts: the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account.  The Consolidated Fund holds all government revenues received through taxes and other receipts for general purposes.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Public Account, on the other hand, holds revenues received for specific purposes, such as small savings, provident funds, and other earmarked funds.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the allocation of revenues between the Consolidated Fund and the Public Account.


**16. With reference to India's "Look East Policy," consider the following statements:**

1. A major objective was to counter the influence of China in the region.
2.  Restoring historical and cultural ties with Southeast and East Asian neighbours was a key objective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's "Look East Policy," later renamed as "Act East Policy," had multiple objectives.  One of the key aims was to enhance India's engagement with Southeast and East Asia, which included countering China's growing influence in the region.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Furthermore, the policy emphasized restoring and strengthening historical and cultural ties with its neighbors in the region.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they present only one aspect of the policy's objectives.


**17. With reference to the consequences of the Lok Sabha's failure to pass the annual Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Finance Minister is required to resign.
2. The Council of Ministers submits its resignation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The annual Union Budget is a crucial piece of legislation.  If the Lok Sabha fails to pass the budget, it signifies a loss of confidence in the government.  This would lead to the resignation of the Council of Ministers, triggering a political crisis and potentially leading to new elections.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Union Finance Minister's resignation is not an automatic consequence; the entire Council of Ministers is responsible for the budget's passage. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the political consequences or incorrectly assign responsibility for resignation to only the Finance Minister.


**18. With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1.  "To vote in public elections" is a Fundamental Duty.
2. "To develop the scientific temper" is not a Fundamental Duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are outlined in Article 51A of the Indian Constitution.  They are non-justiciable moral obligations for citizens.  "To develop the scientific temper" is one of the Fundamental Duties.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Statement 1 is incorrect. "To vote in public elections" is not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Duty in the Constitution, although it is an important civic responsibility.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the list of Fundamental Duties or incorrectly include "voting" as a Fundamental Duty.


**19. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily focuses on ensuring transparency in financial administration.
2. It plays a key role in the distribution of finances among public sector undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's primary role is to recommend the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and State Governments. While transparency is desirable in financial administration, it's not the Finance Commission's central focus.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission does not distribute finances among public sector undertakings; this is handled by the respective ministries and departments. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the Finance Commission's primary functions.


**20. With reference to Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to education is a human right.
2. The right to equal access to public service is not a human right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) lists various fundamental human rights.  The UDHR recognizes the right to education as a fundamental human right.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to equal access to public service is implied within the broader context of non-discrimination and equal opportunity, principles central to the UDHR. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the UDHR's provisions on education or incorrectly exclude equal access to public service as a human right.


**21. With reference to Metropolitan Planning Committees, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are established under the provisions of the Indian Constitution.
2.  Their primary function is to implement government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Metropolitan Planning Committees are established under the 74th Amendment Act, which deals with urban local governance.  However, this act is not a part of the Constitution itself.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The primary function of Metropolitan Planning Committees is to prepare draft development plans for metropolitan areas, not to implement government-sponsored schemes.  Implementation is the responsibility of the local government bodies. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the legal basis of Metropolitan Planning Committees or incorrectly describe their primary function.


**22. With reference to "vote-on-account" and "interim budget," consider the following statements:**

1. A "vote-on-account" is used by a caretaker government, while an "interim budget" is used by a regular government.
2.  An "interim budget" includes both expenditure and receipts, while a "vote-on-account" only deals with expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A "vote-on-account" is a mechanism to provide funds for a limited period, usually for a few months, to enable the government to function. This is usually employed by a regular government when the budget is delayed.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  An "interim budget" is a temporary budget presented when the regular budget cannot be passed in time.  It covers both expenditure and revenue for a limited period. A "vote-on-account" typically only covers expenditure.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the use and scope of "vote-on-account" and "interim budget".


**23. With reference to the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India Act, 1935, provided the framework for the distribution of powers.
2. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, significantly altered the power distribution established in 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, established a federal structure with a system of three lists (Union List, Provincial List, and Concurrent List) to distribute legislative powers between the Centre and the Provinces. This act served as a basis for the power distribution in the Indian Constitution.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Independence Act, 1947, primarily focused on the transfer of power from British rule and did not substantially alter the power distribution framework laid down in 1935. The Constitution of India, however, made significant changes. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of the 1935 Act or incorrectly attribute significant changes in power distribution to the 1947 Act.


**24. With reference to the role of the Gram Sabha under the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gram Sabha has ownership of minor forest produce.
2.  The Gram Sabha's recommendation is required for granting mining leases in Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), aims to empower Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.  The act grants Gram Sabhas significant powers, including the right to manage and control minor forest produce within their areas.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Furthermore, PESA mandates that the Gram Sabha's recommendation is necessary for granting prospecting licenses or mining leases in Scheduled Areas.  This ensures local participation in decisions affecting their resources.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the extent of the Gram Sabha's powers under PESA.


**25. With reference to the purpose of an adjournment motion in the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. It's primarily used to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.
2.  It's a device to postpone parliamentary proceedings due to disorderly conduct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

An adjournment motion is a procedural device in Parliament to interrupt the normal business to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. The motion requires the consent of the Speaker, and if granted, it leads to the suspension of the ongoing business to discuss the urgent matter.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While disorderly conduct might lead to adjournments, the adjournment motion itself is not primarily used for this purpose. Other mechanisms exist to deal with disorderly conduct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the purpose of an adjournment motion or incorrectly link it to the handling of disorderly conduct.


**26. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and its constitutional basis, consider the following statements:**

1. It's based on the right to a healthy environment, interpreted as part of the right to life (Article 21).
2. It's based on provisions related to grants for administration in Scheduled Areas (Article 275(1)).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, establishes a specialized tribunal to address environmental issues.  The Act's constitutional basis is primarily rooted in the right to a healthy environment, which is considered an integral part of the right to life under Article 21.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 275(1) deals with grants for the administration of Scheduled Areas, which is not directly related to the establishment of the National Green Tribunal. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the constitutional basis of the Act or incorrectly link it to provisions related to Scheduled Areas.



**1. With reference to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India requires the prior approval of the Parliament.
2.  The Finance Commission recommends the allocation of funds to states from the Public Account of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India does *not* require the prior approval of Parliament.  It represents obligatory payments, such as salaries of the President and judges, which are constitutionally mandated and not subject to parliamentary vote.  The Parliament does, however, have the power to discuss and debate such expenditure.  Parliament's approval is needed for expenditure *made* from the Consolidated Fund, not expenditure *charged* upon it.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Consolidated Fund of India primarily deals with revenue and expenditure related to government business, the Public Account of India holds various funds, including those for states. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, makes recommendations on the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the states and on the principles governing grants-in-aid to states from the Consolidated Fund.  It also addresses matters referred to it by the President, which can indirectly influence allocations from the Public Account.  Therefore, the Finance Commission's recommendations have a significant bearing on the financial resources available to states, though not a direct allocation from the Public Account itself.


**2. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ordinance promulgated by the President can be withdrawn at any time by the President.
2.  An ordinance ceases to operate six weeks after the reassembly of Parliament, unless it is approved by Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President's power to promulgate ordinances is a crucial aspect of executive power. Article 123 of the Constitution grants this power during the recess of Parliament.  A significant feature of this power is that the President can withdraw an ordinance at any time before it is approved by Parliament. This ensures flexibility in responding to urgent situations, allowing for quick action and subsequent review.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 123 further stipulates that an ordinance shall cease to operate six weeks from the reassembly of Parliament.  If Parliament does not approve the ordinance within this timeframe, it automatically lapses. This provision acts as a check on the executive's power, preventing the indefinite exercise of ordinance-making without legislative ratification.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  It introduced dyarchy at the provincial level.
2.  It established an All-India Federation that included both provinces and princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, *abolished* dyarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level.  Dyarchy, a system where executive authority was divided between Indian ministers and British officials, had been in effect since the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1919. The 1935 Act aimed to grant greater autonomy to the provinces, moving towards responsible government.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the 1935 Act was the establishment of an All-India Federation. This federation was intended to unite British India's provinces and the princely states under a single federal structure. While the Act laid out the framework for this federation, it never fully materialized due to the reluctance of many princely states to join.  The failure to establish a fully functioning federation highlights a significant limitation of the 1935 Act and a crucial factor in the events leading up to Indian independence.


**4. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG's salary and service conditions are determined by the Parliament.
2. The CAG can be removed from office only by the President, on grounds similar to those for removing a Supreme Court judge.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The salary and service conditions of the CAG are determined by the President, not the Parliament.  This is a crucial aspect of the CAG's independence, ensuring that their remuneration is not subject to the whims of the legislature and preventing undue political influence.  The President's role in this matter underscores the constitutional position of the CAG as an independent auditor.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG enjoys a high degree of independence, akin to that of the judiciary.  The Constitution provides that the CAG can be removed from office only by the President, and only on the same grounds and in the same manner as a Supreme Court judge. This stringent procedure safeguards the CAG's independence and ensures that they can perform their duties without fear of political interference. The similarity in removal procedures for the CAG and Supreme Court judges underlines the importance of their respective roles in upholding the Constitution.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. It recommends on the amount of money to be allocated to the states from the Contingency Fund of India.
2. Its advice is binding on the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission does *not* recommend allocations from the Contingency Fund of India. The Contingency Fund is a reserve fund used to meet unforeseen expenditure, and its management is distinct from the Finance Commission's role in revenue distribution and grants-in-aid.  The Finance Commission deals with the Consolidated Fund of India, which is the primary source of government expenditure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The advice of the Finance Commission is *not* binding on the government. While its recommendations carry significant weight and are generally followed, the government retains the authority to accept or reject them, or modify them.  However, the government's reasons for deviating from the commission's advice are usually made public, showcasing transparency and accountability in financial management.  The non-binding nature of the recommendations doesn't diminish their importance, as they provide a crucial framework for fiscal federalism.


**6. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  It features a division of powers between the Union and the States.
2.  It incorporates the principle of separation of powers between the legislature, executive, and judiciary.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A defining characteristic of Indian federalism is the division of powers between the Union and the States. The Constitution outlines three lists—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List—specifying the subjects on which the Union, States, or both can legislate. This division aims to balance the needs of national unity with the autonomy of states.  The allocation of powers reflects the unique historical and political context of India, striving for a balance between centralization and decentralization.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Constitution incorporates the principle of separation of powers, albeit not in a rigid manner. While the legislature (Parliament and State Legislatures), executive (Union and State Governments), and judiciary (Supreme Court and High Courts) have distinct roles and functions, there's some overlap, particularly between the executive and legislature in the parliamentary system. The judiciary's power of judicial review ensures a check on the other two branches, preventing any one branch from becoming too dominant.  The Indian model of separation of powers is a flexible one, adapted to the specific needs of a large and diverse nation.


**7. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies only.
2.  The President can be removed from office only through impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electoral college for the President of India includes *both* elected and nominated members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies. While the elected members form the majority, the inclusion of nominated members reflects a nuanced approach to representation.  The composition of the electoral college is designed to balance the interests of different levels of government and to ensure a broad-based selection process.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India holds a unique position, combining ceremonial and executive functions.  The Constitution provides a specific procedure for removing the President from office, which is through impeachment. This process, outlined in Article 61, requires a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament. The stringent impeachment procedure highlights the high office of the President and the need for a robust mechanism to safeguard against misuse of power.


**8. With reference to the CAG's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, but not those of local bodies.
2.  The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend beyond the Union and State Governments; they also encompass the accounts of local bodies and other public entities. The CAG's wide-ranging audit function is crucial for ensuring accountability and transparency in public finances at all levels of government. The scope of the CAG's audit demonstrates the importance of financial oversight across the governmental structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who is then constitutionally obligated to lay them before Parliament. This ensures that the Parliament has access to the CAG's findings and can hold the executive accountable.  The involvement of the President in this process underlines the significance of the CAG's reports and the importance of parliamentary scrutiny of government finances.


**9. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are *not* justiciable. Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are enforceable in courts, the Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning courts cannot compel the state to implement them.  This distinction reflects the framers' intent to establish aspirational goals for the state without making them legally binding. The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles doesn't diminish their importance, as they serve as guiding principles for government policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by providing a framework for social and economic justice. They outline the government's responsibility to promote the welfare of its citizens, ensuring social security, economic equality, and a decent standard of living.  The emphasis on a welfare state distinguishes India's constitutional vision from that of purely laissez-faire economies, reflecting a commitment to social and economic development.


**10. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Finance Minister is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament.
2.  No expenditure can be incurred by the Union Government without the prior authorization of the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Finance Minister holds primary responsibility for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament. This reflects the central role of the Finance Ministry in managing the nation's finances. The Finance Minister's role in budget preparation and presentation is a key aspect of the government's financial accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  No expenditure can be incurred by the Union Government without the prior authorization of Parliament. This crucial aspect of parliamentary control over government spending ensures financial accountability and prevents arbitrary use of public funds.  The requirement for parliamentary authorization underscores the importance of legislative oversight in budgetary matters.  This principle is a cornerstone of democratic governance, safeguarding against potential excesses of executive power.


**11. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha's powers regarding Money Bills are limited. It cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations or suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept them. This arrangement reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters, ensuring that the lower house retains ultimate control over the government's finances.  The limitation on the Rajya Sabha's power in this context is a key aspect of the Indian parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot *amend* a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments. The Lok Sabha has the sole authority to accept or reject these recommendations.  The distinction between recommending and amending reflects the constitutional balance of power between the two houses of Parliament, with the Lok Sabha holding the dominant position in financial legislation.


**12. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List in the national interest, provided it passes a resolution to that effect.
2. Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution by a simple majority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution allows Parliament to legislate on subjects in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Lok Sabha declaring that it is in the national interest to do so. This provision allows the Union Government to address matters of national importance that may transcend state boundaries, showcasing the flexibility of the Indian federal structure.  This provision is used sparingly, recognizing the importance of state autonomy while acknowledging the need for national-level action in certain circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution by a simple majority.  Different parts of the Constitution require different majorities for amendment.  Some amendments require a simple majority of both Houses, while others require a two-thirds majority of both Houses and ratification by half of the States. The varying requirements for constitutional amendments reflect the framers' intent to protect certain fundamental aspects of the Constitution from easy alteration.  The complexity of the amendment process safeguards the stability and resilience of the constitutional framework.


**13. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. It replaced the Planning Commission.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) replaced the Planning Commission in 2015.  This change reflected a shift in the government's approach to economic planning, moving from a centralized, command-and-control model to a more cooperative and federal one.  The establishment of NITI Aayog aimed to enhance the role of states in development planning and to promote a more collaborative approach to policy-making.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog is appointed by the Prime Minister and enjoys the rank and status of a Cabinet Minister. This high-level position reflects the importance of the Vice-Chairperson's role in guiding the Aayog's activities and in advising the government on policy matters.  The Cabinet-level status of the Vice-Chairperson underlines the significance of NITI Aayog in shaping national development strategies.


**14. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  This reflects the Union Government's role in appointing the head of the executive branch of each state, reflecting the federal nature of the Indian political system.  The President's appointment of the Governor serves as a crucial link between the Union and State Governments.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  While this power is rarely used, it ensures that the Governor remains accountable to the Union Government. The President's power to dismiss the Governor showcases the hierarchical aspect of Indian federalism, while also allowing for the removal of a Governor who is not performing their duties effectively.


**15. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can amend the Constitution by a simple majority.
2. Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State List, provided it passes a resolution to that effect.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Parliament cannot amend the Constitution by a simple majority.  The Constitution mandates different majorities for different types of amendments.  Some amendments require a simple majority of both Houses, while others require a two-thirds majority of both Houses and ratification by half of the States. The requirement for different majorities reflects the framers' intent to protect certain fundamental aspects of the Constitution from easy alteration. The complexity of the amendment process safeguards the stability and resilience of the constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is correct.  Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State List, provided it passes a resolution to that effect declaring that it is in the national interest. This provision allows the Union Government to address matters of national importance that may transcend state boundaries. This showcases the flexibility of the Indian federal structure, allowing the central government to intervene in areas traditionally under state control when deemed necessary in the national interest.  This provision is used sparingly, reflecting a commitment to balancing national interests with state autonomy.


**16. With reference to the Union and State Governments, consider the following statements:**

1. All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  All disbursements from the Public Account require authorization from the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. All revenues received by the Union Government, whether through taxes or other receipts, are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India. This fund is the primary source of government expenditure, ensuring a centralized and transparent system for managing public finances.  The consolidation of revenues in a single fund enhances the government's ability to allocate resources effectively and to maintain financial accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While disbursements from the Consolidated Fund require parliamentary authorization, disbursements from the Public Account do *not* necessarily require such authorization. The Public Account holds various funds, including those for states, and not all withdrawals from it require legislative approval.  Disbursements from the Public Account are governed by specific rules and regulations, but they do not always need the same level of parliamentary oversight as those from the Consolidated Fund. This distinction reflects the different nature of these funds and the need for flexibility in managing certain types of government spending.


**17. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. They are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  They are enforceable in courts of law.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed by the Constitution, are *not* absolute.  They can be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc., as specified by the Constitution itself.  The concept of reasonable restrictions acknowledges the need to balance individual freedoms with societal needs. The limitations on fundamental rights demonstrate the need for a balanced approach to safeguarding both individual liberties and the collective good.

Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Rights are enforceable in courts of law.  Citizens can approach the courts to seek redress if their Fundamental Rights are violated.  The judicial enforcement of Fundamental Rights is a cornerstone of the Indian legal system, ensuring that these rights are not merely theoretical but have real-world consequences. This judicial protection of Fundamental Rights is a key feature of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing its commitment to upholding individual freedoms.


**18.  With reference to the Gram Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. It is constituted under the provisions of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
2. It has the power to prevent alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Sabha, a body comprising adult residents of a village in Scheduled Areas, is a crucial institution established by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act. This Act aimed to empower local communities and to promote decentralized governance. The establishment of the Gram Sabha is a key aspect of the Panchayati Raj system, aiming to strengthen local self-government.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Gram Sabha, in areas covered under the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, possesses the power to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas. This power is designed to protect the land rights of tribal communities and to prevent exploitation. The Gram Sabha's power to safeguard land rights is a significant aspect of its role in protecting the interests of tribal populations.


**19. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a single-member body.
2. It decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is *not* a single-member body. It consists of a Chief Election Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners as the President may from time to time fix.  The composition of the Election Commission is designed to ensure impartiality and to prevent any single individual from having undue influence over the electoral process. The multi-member structure of the Election Commission is a key aspect of its independence and impartiality.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Election Commission of India decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.  This power is crucial for ensuring the smooth conduct of elections and for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process. The Election Commission's responsibility for setting the election schedule showcases its central role in conducting free and fair elections.


**20. With reference to the  Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Public Accounts examines the audit reports of the CAG.
2. The Estimates Committee examines the budget estimates of the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Public Accounts is a crucial parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the audit reports submitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).  This committee plays a vital role in ensuring the accountability of the executive branch in financial matters. The Committee on Public Accounts' examination of CAG reports is a key mechanism for parliamentary oversight of government expenditure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Estimates Committee is another important parliamentary committee that examines the budget estimates of the government.  This committee helps to ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively, promoting greater transparency and accountability in government spending. The Estimates Committee's review of budget estimates is a vital part of the parliamentary process, providing a crucial check on government expenditure.


**1. With reference to the composition of the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constituent Assembly was formed solely through direct elections by the people of India.
2.  The Assembly comprised members nominated by the princely states, alongside those elected by provincial legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constituent Assembly wasn't solely based on direct elections by the people.  While provincial assemblies elected a significant portion of its members, the representation of princely states was through nomination.  The method of selection for princely states' representatives was a crucial aspect of the Assembly's formation, reflecting the complex political landscape of the time.  The process wasn't entirely democratic in its entirety.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constituent Assembly included members elected by provincial legislatures, reflecting the existing political structure of British India.  Crucially, it also included representatives from the princely states, who were nominated, not elected. This inclusion was vital for securing the integration of these states into the newly independent India, highlighting the Assembly's role in negotiating the transition to a unified nation. The inclusion of both elected and nominated members reflects the transitional nature of the political process.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Governor of a State:**

1.  The Governor has the absolute power to dismiss the Chief Minister at any time, without any consultation.
2.  The Governor can reserve a state bill for the consideration of the President if it affects the interests of the Union.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor has the power to dismiss the Chief Minister, it's not absolute.  Conventionally, the Governor acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers and only dismisses the Chief Minister if they lose the confidence of the legislative assembly.  The Governor's power is largely discretionary, but such actions are subject to intense political scrutiny and potential constitutional challenges. Dismissal without sufficient cause could lead to significant political instability.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor's power to reserve a bill for the President's consideration is a crucial aspect of the federal structure. This power allows the Governor to ensure that state legislation doesn't conflict with national interests or the Union's legislative purview.  This power acts as a check and balance, preventing potential conflicts between the Centre and the states, and upholding the integrity of the Indian federal system.


**3. With reference to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that one-third of the seats in Panchayats be reserved for women, irrespective of other reservations.
2.  The Act provides for the establishment of a State Finance Commission to review the financial position of Panchayats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act introduced a crucial provision for women's representation in Panchayati Raj Institutions.  It mandates that at least one-third of the total number of seats be reserved for women, in addition to any other reservations provided for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. This reservation is a cornerstone of the Act's aim to empower women at the grassroots level of governance, significantly impacting gender dynamics in rural India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Recognizing the financial needs of Panchayats, the Act established the mechanism of State Finance Commissions. These commissions are tasked with reviewing the financial position of Panchayats and recommending measures for their fiscal empowerment.  This ensures that Panchayats have adequate resources to carry out their functions effectively, contributing to the success of decentralized governance in India.  The establishment of these commissions reflects a commitment to ensuring that the decentralization of power also includes equitable distribution of financial resources.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Union Budget:**

1.  The Union Budget is presented to Parliament by the President of India.
2.  The Finance Bill, which gives effect to the financial proposals in the Union Budget, can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Union Budget is ultimately approved by Parliament and reflects government policy, it's presented to Parliament by the Finance Minister on behalf of the government. The President doesn't directly present the Budget; this role is a constitutional function of the Finance Minister, highlighting the executive branch's role in fiscal matters.  The Finance Minister's presentation is a key moment in the parliamentary process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Bill, a crucial part of the budget process, is a Money Bill.  As per the Indian Constitution, Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government finances, maintaining a crucial check and balance within the parliamentary system. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills.


**5. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a simple majority.
2.  The Parliament can create new states or alter the boundaries of existing states through a simple majority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Amending the Constitution isn't a simple majority process.  While most amendments can be passed by a special majority (two-thirds of those present and voting in each House and a majority of the total membership), amendments relating to certain fundamental rights require ratification by half of the state legislatures. The process reflects the constitutional importance of fundamental rights and the need for broad consensus in altering them.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The creation of new states or alteration of boundaries requires a special majority in Parliament, along with the approval of the state legislatures affected.  This process reflects the federal structure of India, requiring more than a simple majority to ensure that changes to states' territorial integrity have broad support and don't undermine the balance of power.  The process safeguards the integrity of the federal system.


**6.  With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners appointed by the President.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for the conduct of elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures only, not local bodies.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and can include other Election Commissioners appointed by the President. This structure ensures the independence and impartiality of the election process. The multi-member structure allows for a division of labor and reduces the potential for bias.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Election Commission conducts elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures, it also plays a role in the conduct of elections to local bodies in many states. The extent of its involvement varies from state to state, depending on local laws and regulations, but it is not limited to national and state-level elections. Its responsibilities encompass the entire spectrum of elections, ensuring a consistent and fair process across levels of government.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a fixed term, and can only be removed through impeachment.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government, not the State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President for a fixed term and enjoys a high degree of independence. Removal from office requires a process akin to impeachment, ensuring their impartiality and protecting them from undue political influence. This independence is vital for ensuring the integrity of the audit process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  This broad mandate ensures accountability and transparency across all levels of government, playing a vital role in maintaining financial discipline and preventing corruption. The CAG's audit reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**8. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. They aim to create a social and economic order that promotes the welfare of the people.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles are not justiciable.  They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies and legislation, but they cannot be enforced by courts.  Their non-justiciable nature reflects their aspirational character, allowing for flexibility in implementation while maintaining their importance as guiding principles.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles aim to create a just and equitable society, promoting social and economic justice, and ensuring the welfare of the people. They are fundamental to the Indian Constitution's commitment to a welfare state, providing a moral compass for government action.  Their influence is seen across various social and economic policies.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college consisting of only the elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.
2. The President can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's electoral college includes elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies, but it also includes nominated members of the State Legislative Assemblies.  The inclusion of nominated members, though a smaller fraction, reflects a broader representation in the presidential election.

Statement 2 is correct. The President can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament. This process requires a two-thirds majority in both Houses, ensuring a high threshold for removal and protecting the office from arbitrary actions.  The impeachment process underscores the importance of the office and the need for a rigorous procedure for removal.


**10. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of Panchayats in all states.
2.  The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act recommends a three-tier system, but it's not mandatory for all states.  The specific structure of Panchayats can vary depending on the state's geographical and demographic characteristics.  The flexibility in implementation reflects the federal nature of India and the need to adapt to diverse contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha, a vital component of the Panchayati Raj system, consists of all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village.  This inclusive definition ensures broad participation in local governance, empowering villagers to voice their concerns and participate in decision-making processes.  The Gram Sabha's role is central to the participatory nature of the Panchayati Raj system.


**11. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate Money Bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does *not* have the power to initiate Money Bills. This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha, reflecting its primary role in controlling government finances. The restriction on the Rajya Sabha's power in this area underscores the Lok Sabha's dominance in fiscal matters.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's final authority on Money Bills ensures the smooth functioning of the government's financial processes.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role prevents potential stalemates over fiscal legislation.


**12. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are not absolute.  While they are enshrined in the Constitution, they are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, security, and other legitimate state objectives.  The balance between individual rights and societal needs is a crucial aspect of the Indian legal framework.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies is a crucial part of the Fundamental Rights framework. It empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court to enforce their Fundamental Rights.  This right is considered the "heart and soul" of the Fundamental Rights, ensuring their effective protection and safeguarding against potential state infringements.  The Supreme Court's role in upholding these rights is central to the Indian legal system.

1.  Union Territories have their own State Legislatures and Councils of Ministers.
2.  The executive head of a Union Territory is always a Lieutenant Governor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Not all Union Territories have their own State Legislatures and Councils of Ministers. Some Union Territories have a legislature, while others are administered directly by the central government.  The variation in administrative structures reflects the diverse needs and characteristics of different Union Territories.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The executive head of a Union Territory can be a Lieutenant Governor, an Administrator, or a Chief Commissioner, depending on the specific constitutional provisions governing that territory.  The diversity in administrative structures highlights the flexibility in managing Union Territories based on their unique situations.


**14. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NGT has the power to hear cases related to environmental damage and violations of environmental laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, not the Constitution itself. Its creation reflects the increasing importance of environmental concerns and the need for a specialized judicial mechanism to address them efficiently.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT has been established to provide speedy and effective environmental justice and help reduce the burden of litigation in the higher courts.  It has jurisdiction to hear cases related to environmental damage and violations of environmental laws, playing a significant role in environmental protection and enforcement.  Its specialized expertise makes it well-suited to address complex environmental issues.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Governor's power to promulgate ordinances:**

1. The Governor can promulgate an ordinance only when the State Legislature is not in session.
2. An ordinance promulgated by the Governor has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor's power to promulgate ordinances is exercised when the State Legislature is not in session. This power allows for swift action on urgent matters that cannot wait for the legislature's next session.  This provision is a crucial part of the executive's ability to respond effectively to crises or urgent situations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Ordinances have the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature, but they must be approved by the Legislature within a specified period.  If not approved, they lapse.  This ensures that the executive's power to act decisively is balanced by the legislature's ultimate authority in lawmaking.  The temporary nature of ordinances prevents them from becoming permanent without legislative scrutiny.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates direct elections for all Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) chairpersons at all levels.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act requires the establishment of State Finance Commissions to review the financial position of PRIs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does *not* mandate direct elections for all PRI chairpersons. While it provides for the constitution of Panchayats at the village, intermediate and district levels, the mode of election of chairpersons at the intermediate and district levels is left to the state legislatures.  Many states opt for indirect elections for these positions.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act makes a provision for the establishment of State Finance Commissions in every state.  These commissions are tasked with reviewing the financial position of the Panchayats and making recommendations on the principles governing the distribution of financial resources among them.  This is crucial for ensuring the financial viability and effective functioning of PRIs.  The act emphasizes the importance of financial autonomy for PRIs.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can withhold assent to a state bill that has been passed by the state legislature but cannot send it back for reconsideration.
2.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the state, who then advises the Governor on the appointment of other ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Governor has the power to withhold assent to a state bill,  the Governor can also return the bill to the state legislature for reconsideration.  This is a significant power of the Governor to influence the legislative process.  The legislature can override the Governor's objections if the bill is passed again with a majority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the state legislative assembly.  The Chief Minister then advises the Governor on the appointment of other ministers, forming the Council of Ministers. This reflects the principle of responsible government at the state level.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the term "Cabinet" and details its composition and functions.
2. The Constitution mandates that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* explicitly define the term "Cabinet" or detail its composition and functions.  While Article 74 deals with the Council of Ministers, it doesn't specifically mention a "Cabinet" as a separate entity. The Cabinet is a convention evolved over time within the parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 75(3) of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.  This is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy, ensuring the executive's accountability to the legislature.  The Lok Sabha can remove the Council of Ministers through a vote of no-confidence.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):**

1. The CAG submits its audit reports directly to the President of India.
2. The CAG has the power to audit the accounts of all government bodies, including the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), but not the accounts of private companies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG submits its audit reports to the Parliament, not directly to the President.  This ensures transparency and accountability to the legislature.  The reports are laid before both Houses of Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's audit powers are extensive. It audits the accounts of all government bodies, including PSUs, to ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively. However, the CAG's audit jurisdiction does not extend to private companies.


**5. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC can only conduct examinations for the All India Services and not for other central government services.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC's mandate is broader than just the All India Services.  It conducts examinations and recruitment processes for various central government services, including the civil services, and also advises the government on matters of recruitment and service conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India appoints the Chairman and members of the UPSC.  This ensures the independence and impartiality of the commission in its recruitment and advisory roles.  The appointment process usually involves consultation with other relevant authorities.


**6. Consider the following statements about the President's Rule:**

1. The President can impose President's Rule in a state only after receiving a report from the Governor of that state recommending such action.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 356 of the Constitution allows the President to impose President's Rule in a state, but only on the basis of a report from the Governor that the state's constitutional machinery has broken down.  The Governor's report is a crucial trigger for the imposition of President's Rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While President's Rule can initially be imposed for a period of six months, it requires the approval of Parliament to be extended beyond that period.  Parliament's approval is essential to ensure that the use of this extraordinary power is subject to democratic scrutiny.


**7. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India mandates the reservation of one-third of seats for women in PRIs at all three levels (village, intermediate, and district).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the reservation of at least one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats at all levels for women. This is a crucial step in promoting women's participation in local governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  PRIs have the power to levy certain taxes and collect revenues to fund their activities. However, the extent of their tax powers is subject to limitations and restrictions imposed by state governments. This is to prevent conflicts and ensure a balanced fiscal system.


**8. With reference to the role of the Rajya Sabha in financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha, but the Lok Sabha can reject the amendments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha can propose amendments to a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept them.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills, reflecting its dominance in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot delay a Money Bill. It can only consider the bill for a maximum of 14 days, but it cannot prevent its passage.  The Lok Sabha can pass the Money Bill even if the Rajya Sabha rejects it.  This reflects the constitutional provision giving the lower house greater power over finance.


**9. Consider the following statements about the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution.
2. The NCSC investigates all matters relating to the safeguards provided to Scheduled Castes under the Constitution and reports to the Parliament.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution.  It enjoys constitutional status and is empowered to investigate matters related to the welfare and protection of Scheduled Castes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCSC investigates matters relating to safeguards for Scheduled Castes and reports to the President, who then places the report before the Parliament. The reporting mechanism involves the President as an intermediary.


**10. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by setting out the socio-economic goals for the government to strive for.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPSPs are *not* justiciable; they are not enforceable by courts.  They are meant to guide the government's policies and actions in achieving social and economic justice but do not create legally enforceable rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs outline the socio-economic goals that the Indian state should strive to achieve.  They aim to create a welfare state that promotes social justice, equality, and the well-being of its citizens.  The principles provide a framework for policy-making.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 280 of the Constitution mandates that the President shall constitute a Finance Commission every five years or at such earlier time as the President considers necessary. The commission's role is to examine the financial relations between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are *not* legally binding on the Union and State Governments. They are, however, generally accepted and followed as they provide an expert assessment of the financial position and needs of the country. The government can however choose to not accept them.


**12. With reference to the features of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of federalism in India is characterized by a rigid Constitution that is difficult to amend.
2.  The Indian Constitution adopts a parliamentary system of government where the executive is responsible to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution is not strictly rigid; it has a flexible amendment process.  While some provisions are difficult to amend (requiring special majorities), others can be amended with a simple majority.  The balance between rigidity and flexibility is an important feature.

Statement 2 is correct. India follows a parliamentary system where the executive (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the legislature (Parliament). This ensures accountability and a check on executive power.  The government can be removed through a vote of no-confidence.

1. The Rajya Sabha represents the states and union territories, while the Lok Sabha represents the people of India.
2. The total number of members in the Rajya Sabha is fixed by the Constitution, while the total number of members in the Lok Sabha is not fixed.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha is the Council of States, representing the states and union territories of India.  The Lok Sabha is the House of the People, representing the entire population of India through direct elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The total number of members in the Lok Sabha is fixed by the Constitution (currently 543), while the total number of members in the Rajya Sabha is not fixed; it has a maximum limit set by the Constitution.

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).
2. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the power to certify a bill as a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the authority to certify a bill as a Money Bill.  This certification is crucial as it determines the legislative procedure followed for the bill, including its passage through Parliament. The Speaker's decision is final and cannot be questioned.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and, as per the needs, up to two other Election Commissioners appointed by the President of India.  The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased as per the requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India itself decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does not have a role in determining this schedule.  The ECI's independence in this matter is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a breakdown of law and order or failure of the constitutional machinery is a common reason for imposing President's rule (Article 356), it doesn't necessitate the state government losing the confidence of the state legislative assembly. The President can impose President's rule under various circumstances, including situations where the government can still command a majority in the assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule does not automatically dissolve the state legislative assembly.  While it is often accompanied by the dissolution of the assembly, the President has the discretion to keep the assembly functioning, depending on the circumstances.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly mentions the word "Federation".
2. The Indian federal structure is based on a rigid division of powers between the Centre and the States, with no scope for flexibility.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly use the word "Federation". It describes India as a "Union of States," suggesting a more integrated and less contractual arrangement compared to a typical federation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Indian Constitution does outline a division of powers, it isn't entirely rigid.  The Constitution allows for flexibility through mechanisms like the concurrent list, where both the Centre and States can legislate, and the Centre's power to legislate on state subjects during emergencies.  The Supreme Court's role in interpreting the Constitution further allows for adaptability.


**4. With reference to Local Self-Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Local self-government is primarily an exercise in direct democracy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Local self-government is not primarily an exercise in direct democracy, where citizens directly participate in decision-making. Instead, it's a system of indirect democracy, with elected representatives making decisions on behalf of the local population.  Direct democracy elements might exist at the Gram Sabha level but are not the defining feature of the entire system.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment (Panchayats) and 74th Amendment (Municipalities) Acts provided constitutional status and three-tier structures for rural and urban local governments respectively. These amendments aim to empower local bodies and ensure greater democratic decentralization.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Private Member's Bills can be introduced in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  However, the chances of a Private Member's Bill becoming law are significantly lower compared to government bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill. It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha's decision on a Money Bill is final.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Parliamentary Committees:**

1. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the past performance of government departments.
2. The Public Accounts Committee examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Estimates Committee is a parliamentary committee that examines the estimates included in the annual budget before they are approved. It focuses on the efficiency and economy of government spending and doesn't scrutinize past performance directly.  The examination of past performance is done by other committees.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's audit reports and ensures that government funds are used efficiently and accountably.  It holds the executive accountable for financial irregularities.


**7. With reference to the Indian Cabinet, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Cabinet" is explicitly defined in the Constitution of India.
2. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not explicitly define the term "Cabinet." While Articles 74 and 75 deal with the Council of Ministers, the Cabinet, as a smaller, more powerful body within the Council of Ministers, is a convention of the parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means that the entire Cabinet must resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  This principle of collective responsibility is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy.



**8. With reference to the judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The power of judicial review enables the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution of India doesn't explicitly mention "judicial review" as a power of the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court has established this power through its interpretations of the Constitution, particularly through its ability to examine the constitutionality of laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Judicial review empowers the judiciary to assess the constitutionality of laws, not their wisdom.  The courts determine whether a law violates the Constitution, not whether it's a good or bad policy decision.  The legislature is responsible for policy-making.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are justiciable in nature.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards, but their non-implementation does not lead to legal consequences.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by directing the state to pursue social and economic justice, ensuring a minimum standard of living, and promoting social welfare measures.


**10. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment process ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to both the President and the Parliament.  This ensures transparency and accountability in the utilization of public funds.  The Parliament uses these reports to scrutinize government spending.

1. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2. The Ninth Schedule was introduced by the First Constitutional Amendment Act, 1951.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While initially laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court's ruling in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* clarified that this immunity doesn't apply to laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973.  Such laws are subject to judicial review on the basis of the "basic structure" doctrine.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951.  This was done to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Privacy in India:**

1. The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution of India.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Right in the original text of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India, in the *Puttaswamy* case, recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right flowing from Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty). This landmark judgment established the Right to Privacy as a crucial facet of individual liberty in India.


**13. With reference to the Union Budget of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented by the Finance Minister in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The Union Budget must always receive the approval of the Rajya Sabha before it can be implemented.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Minister presents the Union Budget to both Houses of Parliament.  The presentation in the Lok Sabha is usually followed by a detailed discussion and debate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can discuss and even recommend amendments to the budget, it does not have the power to reject it.  The Lok Sabha's approval is sufficient for the budget to be implemented.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can remove the Governor at any time, although this is typically done on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.  This provision ensures that the Governor remains answerable to the central government.


**15. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, etc.  The Supreme Court plays a vital role in defining the limits of these restrictions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32) empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court to enforce their Fundamental Rights. This right is considered crucial because it enables citizens to seek redressal if their Fundamental Rights are violated.  Without this right, the other Fundamental Rights would be significantly weakened.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Aadhaar Card:**

1. The Aadhaar card is mandatory for all Indian citizens.
2. The Aadhaar card serves as conclusive proof of Indian citizenship.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Aadhaar card is widely used and encouraged, it is not mandatory for all Indian citizens.  The Supreme Court has upheld the right to privacy and the voluntary nature of Aadhaar enrollment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Aadhaar card is a biometric identification document, primarily used for proving identity, and not conclusive proof of Indian citizenship.  Proof of citizenship is determined through other legal means and documents.  Aadhaar can be a useful piece of evidence, but not the sole determinant.


**17. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT has original jurisdiction to hear cases relating to environmental issues.
2. The NGT's decisions are binding on all courts in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NGT has original jurisdiction to hear cases related to environmental issues.  This means that cases can be directly filed in the NGT, without first going through other courts.  This is designed to expedite environmental justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NGT's decisions are important and carry significant weight, they are not binding on all courts in India.  Its decisions can be challenged in higher courts like the Supreme Court.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body.
2. The UPSC's recommendations for appointments are binding on the government.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTE Act, 2009, makes free and compulsory education a fundamental right for children aged 6-14 years.  This is a significant step towards ensuring that all children have access to basic education.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RTE Act aims to ensure that children enter school by age 6, it allows for flexibility. Children can be admitted to school even if they are older than 6, provided they are within the age group of 6-14.  The focus is on ensuring that all children in this age group receive education.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats.
2. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of one-third of seats for women in Panchayats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Panchayats, in proportion to their population in the respective areas.  This is to ensure that marginalized communities have a voice in local governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment also mandates reservation of at least one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats for women. This is a significant step towards promoting gender equality in local governance.


**1. With reference to the theory of basic structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly lists all the basic tenets.
2. The judiciary has the sole authority to determine which aspects constitute the basic structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The theory of basic structure, established in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973), holds that Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution that forms its fundamental framework.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Constitution doesn't provide an exhaustive list of basic tenets; the judiciary has evolved this concept through judicial pronouncements.  Statement 2 is correct because while the theory originated with the judiciary, and subsequent cases have shaped its application, the ultimate authority to define the basic structure rests with the Supreme Court.  The judiciary's role is crucial in safeguarding the Constitution's core values against potentially destructive amendments.  Different political parties and governments may have their interpretations, but the final word rests with the court's interpretation of the basic structure doctrine.


**2. With reference to constitutional amendments during 2000-2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments during this period indicate a strong public mandate for specific legislative changes.
2. The high number of amendments suggests a lack of significant ideological differences among political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A high number of constitutional amendments in a short period doesn't automatically imply a consensus among political parties or a strong public mandate.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the passage only states that many amendments occurred, not that they reflected public pressure.  There could be other factors like political maneuvering or strategic legislative changes by a ruling party with a strong majority.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because a flurry of amendments might indicate, conversely, significant political differences requiring legislative solutions, even if these solutions are not necessarily controversial in themselves. The absence of information regarding public opinion or party positions prevents a definitive conclusion regarding public pressure or party consensus.


**3. With reference to the special majority requirement for constitutional amendments, consider the following statements:**

1.  A special majority ensures that significant changes to the Constitution require broader political support.
2.  The special majority provision prevents frequent amendments and ensures stability in the constitutional framework.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The requirement of a special majority for constitutional amendments serves multiple purposes. Statement 1 is correct because it necessitates a broader consensus within the legislature, thereby preventing hasty or partisan changes to the fundamental law.  This ensures that major constitutional changes are not solely determined by the will of a simple majority.  Statement 2 is also correct as the higher threshold for amendment approval inherently limits the frequency of changes, contributing to greater constitutional stability.  Frequent amendments can lead to uncertainty and undermine the Constitution's authority.  The special majority safeguards against impulsive alterations and promotes a considered approach to constitutional reform.


**4. With reference to the interpretation of the Constitution by the Judiciary and Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Divergent interpretations by the Judiciary and Parliament always lead to constitutional amendments.
2. Constitutional amendments are solely a response to judicial interpretations and never reflect independent legislative intent.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While differing interpretations between the judiciary and Parliament can sometimes necessitate amendments, it's not an automatic outcome.  Statement 1 is incorrect because divergent views might be resolved through further judicial pronouncements or legislative clarification without requiring a formal constitutional amendment.  The legislature may choose to not act on a judicial interpretation.  Statement 2 is also incorrect as the Parliament's legislative agenda isn't exclusively reactive to judicial decisions.  Amendments often reflect independent legislative priorities, societal changes, or political considerations separate from judicial rulings.  The relationship between judicial interpretation and legislative amendment is complex and not always directly causal.


**5. Consider the following statements about the unrepresentative nature of the Constituent Assembly:**

1. The Constituent Assembly lacked sufficient representation from marginalized communities.
2. The lack of representation from certain sections of society necessarily renders the Constitution unrepresentative.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Criticisms regarding the Constituent Assembly's composition often highlight the underrepresentation of certain groups. Statement 1 is correct because several critiques point to the inadequate representation of marginalized communities, including women, certain religious minorities, and lower castes.  This imbalance raises questions about the Assembly's ability to fully reflect the diverse interests of Indian society. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While underrepresentation is a valid concern, it doesn't automatically invalidate the entire Constitution.  The Constitution's subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations have addressed some of the initial shortcomings, and its enduring relevance demonstrates its capacity to adapt to evolving societal needs.  The Constitution's success lies in its ability to evolve and address issues not fully considered during its initial drafting.


**6. With reference to gender justice in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution adequately addresses gender justice within the family structure.
2. The absence of adequate provisions for gender justice is a significant limitation of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution, while making significant strides towards gender equality, has been criticized for its shortcomings in addressing gender justice fully, particularly within the family.  Statement 1 is incorrect because critics point out that the Constitution hasn't comprehensively tackled gender inequalities embedded in social structures and family laws.  While the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, its impact on deeply ingrained patriarchal norms has been limited.  Statement 2 is correct because the lack of explicit provisions to address gender-based inequalities within families constitutes a notable limitation.  The continued prevalence of gender discrimination and violence highlights this deficiency. Subsequent legislative actions and judicial pronouncements have aimed to rectify these shortcomings, but the fundamental issue remains.


**7. With reference to the placement of socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles rather than Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Placing socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles reflects a pragmatic approach given India's developmental challenges.
2.  The relegation of socio-economic rights to the Directive Principles is a major flaw in the Constitution's design.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The classification of socio-economic rights as Directive Principles instead of Fundamental Rights is a subject of ongoing debate. Statement 1 is correct because the framers likely considered the economic constraints and developmental priorities of newly independent India.  Making socio-economic rights legally enforceable (as Fundamental Rights) might have been impractical given the resource limitations at the time.  The Directive Principles provide a framework for gradual implementation, aligning with the nation's developmental goals.  Statement 2 is incorrect because, while some argue that this classification weakens the enforceability of these rights, others see it as a pragmatic approach reflecting the realities of a developing nation.  The Directive Principles serve as aspirational goals that guide government policy.


**8.  With reference to the theory of basic structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The theory of basic structure enhances the power of the legislature.
2. The theory of basic structure has been consistently accepted by all political parties.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The theory of basic structure significantly impacts the balance of power between the judiciary and the legislature. Statement 1 is incorrect because this doctrine, while not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, limits the amending power of the Parliament. By restricting the scope of amendments, the theory enhances the power of the judiciary to act as a check on legislative actions. Statement 2 is also incorrect as while the theory has gained widespread acceptance, it hasn’t achieved universal consensus among all political parties.  Different political viewpoints exist regarding the extent and application of the basic structure doctrine.  The judiciary's interpretation of this theory remains central to its application and this has been a source of both support and criticism from different political actors.


**9. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was initially intended to protect laws related to land reforms.
2.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are completely immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution to protect certain laws from judicial review, initially focusing on land reforms. Statement 1 is correct because the primary purpose of the Ninth Schedule, when it was introduced, was to safeguard laws aimed at addressing agrarian inequalities.  Land reforms were a significant political and social priority in the early years of India's independence. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While initially intended to shield laws from judicial scrutiny, the Supreme Court's ruling in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* (2007) clarified that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Ninth Schedule's protective power is not absolute.



**10. With reference to the sources of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of Directive Principles of State Policy was primarily borrowed from the Irish Constitution.
2. The concept of judicial review was primarily adopted from the Australian Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution drew inspiration from various sources globally, incorporating features deemed suitable for the Indian context. Statement 1 is correct because the Directive Principles of State Policy found their origin in the Irish Constitution.  These principles aim to guide the state toward social and economic justice.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the concept of judicial review, the power of the judiciary to review legislative and executive actions for constitutionality, was primarily borrowed from the U.S. Constitution.  While other constitutions also have judicial review mechanisms, the American model significantly influenced the Indian system.  The Australian Constitution, while having its own system, did not serve as the primary source for this aspect of Indian constitutional law.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the instructions, some questions may appear similar in theme but will differ in the specific details tested.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Union Executive, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India is the supreme commander of the armed forces, but the actual exercise of this power is delegated to the Minister of Defence.
2.  The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the President is the supreme commander of the armed forces as per Article 53, the actual operational command and control are vested in the Ministry of Defence, headed by the Defence Minister. This is a practical application of the principle of collective responsibility. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers in this and most other executive matters.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Article 75 explicitly states that the Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and the other Ministers are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) is a cornerstone of India's parliamentary system. This means the entire Council can be forced to resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution's provisions on Fundamental Rights:**

1.  The right to freedom of religion includes the freedom to manage religious affairs, subject to public order, morality, and health.
2.  The right to constitutional remedies guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights, and this right itself is not a Fundamental Right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 26 of the Constitution grants freedom to manage religious affairs of religious denominations, including the establishment of religious institutions. However, this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state to maintain public order, morality, and health. This is an important aspect of the balancing act between individual freedoms and societal interests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to constitutional remedies (Article 32) is itself considered a Fundamental Right.  It's a crucial safeguard, ensuring access to the courts for the enforcement of other Fundamental Rights.  Without this right, other Fundamental Rights would be significantly weakened.  The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, meaning it can determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Union Legislature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) can initiate a Money Bill.
2.  A Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha but can be returned to the Lok Sabha with recommendations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Only the Lok Sabha (House of the People) can initiate a Money Bill. This is a crucial aspect of the Constitution designed to maintain the Lok Sabha's primacy in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to considering and making recommendations on a Money Bill, but it cannot reject or substantially amend it.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  It can, however, return the bill to the Lok Sabha with its recommendations. The Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject these recommendations. This procedure reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial legislation.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution's Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law like Fundamental Rights.
2.  They aim to create a welfare state by outlining the socio-economic goals of the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles are not justiciable; they are not legally enforceable in courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies and laws aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  This non-justiciable nature prevents them from being used to overturn existing laws or policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by setting out the socio-economic objectives the state should strive to achieve.  They address issues like providing equal pay for equal work, securing a living wage, and providing free and compulsory education.  They represent the social and economic vision of the Constitution's framers.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Governor:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister of that state.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 155 of the Constitution clearly outlines that the Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can remove the Governor at any time, although such action is rare and usually occurs under exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 174 of the Constitution states that the Governor can dissolve the Legislative Assembly of the state at any time on the advice of the Chief Minister. This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system in India, ensuring that the state government is accountable to the state legislature. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the state is under President's rule (Article 356).


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually to the Parliament, and it includes the Annual Financial Statement (AFS) and the Demands for Grants.
2. The President of India allocates the financial resources to the various ministries, based on the recommendations from the Union Budget.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 112 of the Constitution mandates the presentation of the Union Budget annually to the Parliament. This budget includes the Annual Financial Statement (AFS), which details the estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for the financial year, and the Demands for Grants, which seek Parliamentary approval for government spending on various programs and services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President does not directly allocate financial resources to ministries. The allocation of funds is done by the Ministry of Finance, based on the approved budget. The President's role is primarily ceremonial in this context; he/she approves the budget after it has been passed by both houses of the Parliament.  The executive branch, specifically the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for the implementation and distribution of the allocated funds.


**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, enabling it to determine the constitutionality of laws passed by the Parliament and state legislatures.
2. The Supreme Court's decisions are final and binding on all other courts in India, and no appeal lies to any higher court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, a fundamental aspect of its role in upholding the Constitution.  It can declare laws passed by the Parliament or state legislatures void if they are inconsistent with the Constitution. This power is vital for maintaining the rule of law and preventing the government from exceeding its constitutional limits.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The decisions of the Supreme Court are final and binding on all other courts within India. There is no further appeal available against a Supreme Court judgment.  This establishes the Supreme Court as the highest court of appeal in the country, ensuring uniformity in the interpretation and application of the law.



**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution's Emergency Provisions:**

1.  A National Emergency can be declared only if there is a threat to the security of India.
2.  During a National Emergency, Fundamental Rights under Articles 19, 20 and 21 can be suspended.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 352 of the Indian Constitution allows the President to declare a National Emergency only if the security of India or any part thereof is threatened by war or external aggression or armed rebellion.  The declaration must be based on a written recommendation from the Cabinet.  This provision is intended to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and integrity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many Fundamental Rights can be suspended during a National Emergency,  Articles 20 and 21 (protection in respect of conviction for offences and protection of life and personal liberty) cannot be suspended even during a National Emergency. Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly, etc.) can be suspended. This limitation safeguards essential human rights even in times of crisis.


**9. With reference to the  Panchayati Raj Institutions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of Panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels in all states.
2.  The state governments are responsible for conducting elections to the Panchayati Raj Institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 73rd Amendment Act aims to establish a three-tier Panchayati Raj system, it doesn't mandate this structure in all states. The specific structure and number of tiers can vary depending on the state's geographical and demographic characteristics. The Act provides a framework but allows for flexibility in implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The state governments are responsible for conducting elections to the Panchayati Raj Institutions.  They establish State Election Commissions to oversee these elections, ensuring free and fair processes.  This decentralization of power to the state level is a key feature of India's federal structure.


**10. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of certain other bodies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President but holds office for a fixed term (6 years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier).  While the President can remove the CAG, this is only possible through a process similar to the impeachment of a judge, requiring a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament. This ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG audits the accounts relating to all moneys received and expended by or under the authority of the Union and of each State Government, and also audits the accounts of various other bodies as specified by the Constitution and other laws.  This audit function is crucial for maintaining financial accountability and transparency in government operations.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and state legislatures.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the  All India Services:**

1. All India Services officers are appointed by the President of India.
2.  The All India Services include the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Police Service (IPS), and the Indian Forest Service (IFS).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  All India Services officers are appointed by the President of India.  This reflects the national importance of these services and ensures a degree of uniformity in their operations across different states.  However, the process involves recommendations from the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).

Statement 2 is also correct. The All India Services comprise the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Police Service (IPS), and the Indian Forest Service (IFS). These services are crucial for the efficient administration of the country, providing a cadre of officers who serve both at the central and state levels.  Their all-India character helps maintain national standards and integration.


**12. With reference to the  Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the President to constitute a Finance Commission every five years, or at such earlier time as the President considers necessary.  The Commission's role is to review the financial relations between the Union and the States and make recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and usually followed, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  The government can accept or reject the recommendations, but it is expected to provide reasons for any deviations.  This reflects the balance of power between the independent Finance Commission and the elected government.


**13. With reference to the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action to the government.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not through a constitutional amendment.  While it plays a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights in India, it does not have the same legal standing as bodies explicitly established by the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC has the power to investigate allegations of human rights violations and recommend remedial action to the government.  It can also intervene in cases of human rights abuses and take suo moto cognizance of such cases.  However, its recommendations are not legally binding but carry significant moral and political weight.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the  NITI Aayog:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission of India.
2. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) was established in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission.  This shift reflected a change in the government's approach to economic planning, moving from a centralized, command-and-control model to a more cooperative and collaborative one involving states and other stakeholders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established through a resolution of the government, not by a constitutional amendment.  This reflects its position as a policy advisory body rather than a constitutional institution with specific powers enshrined in the Constitution.  Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the government.


**15. With reference to the  Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a three-member body, comprising a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) typically consists of a Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and two Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the President, based on the needs of the ECI.  The CEC and Election Commissioners are appointed by the President.

Statement 2 is also correct. The ECI is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, President, Vice-President, and other bodies as may be specified by the government. It plays a crucial role in India's democratic process, ensuring the integrity of elections and the peaceful transfer of power.  Its independence is safeguarded by the Constitution.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India: **
    1. The Election Commission of India is a three-member body, with the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
    2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) can consist of a single member (the Chief Election Commissioner) or more than one member (the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners).  Currently, it is a three-member body. The number of Election Commissioners is decided by the government from time to time,  making the number of members not fixed in the Constitution. The Constitution only mandates a Chief Election Commissioner.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body, is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does not have this power. The ECI's independence is crucial to ensuring free and fair elections.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**
    1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
    2. The President's rule suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution in that State.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in session.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President based on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's Rule does not automatically suspend the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.  While some limitations on fundamental rights might occur during an emergency, it is not a direct consequence of President's Rule itself.  The suspension of fundamental rights is usually associated with a national emergency (Article 352).


**3. With reference to Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**
    1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a clear division of powers between the Centre and the States, with each having its own distinct sphere of legislative and executive authority.
    2. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature, with the Rajya Sabha representing the States and ensuring their participation in the legislative process.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Indian Constitution does establish a federal structure with a division of powers between the Union and State governments through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. However, the Union government holds significant powers due to several provisions, leading some to argue it's a quasi-federal system. Nonetheless, a clear division of powers forms the basis.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Parliament is bicameral, comprising the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The Rajya Sabha represents the states, with members elected by the state legislative assemblies.  This ensures a degree of federal balance in the legislative process.  However, the Rajya Sabha's powers are limited compared to the Lok Sabha, particularly in financial matters.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Parliament of India:**
    1.  A private member's bill can only be introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the ruling party.
    2. The Parliament exercises control over the executive through various mechanisms, including questions, debates, and motions.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A private member's bill can be introduced by any Member of Parliament (MP), regardless of their party affiliation.  The term "private member" simply refers to an MP who is not a minister.  While bills introduced by ministers (government bills) typically have priority, private members can introduce bills.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament of India, functioning under a parliamentary system, has several mechanisms to oversee the executive branch (the Council of Ministers). These include question hour, debates on government policies and bills, motions of no-confidence, adjournment motions, and the power to approve budgets.


**5. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**
    1. The Committee on Public Accounts examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
    2. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the estimates included in the Union Budget.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Public Accounts (PAC) is a parliamentary committee that plays a crucial role in overseeing government spending.  A key part of its function is examining the audit reports submitted by the CAG, ensuring that public funds are used efficiently and effectively.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Estimates Committee is another important parliamentary committee whose primary function is to scrutinize the estimates presented in the Union Budget. It examines the government's proposed expenditure to identify areas for potential savings and improvements in efficiency.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judicial System:**
    1. The Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, allowing it to strike down laws that are inconsistent with the Constitution.
    2. The High Courts in India have both original and appellate jurisdiction.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court of appeal, possesses the power of judicial review. This means it can examine laws passed by the Parliament or state legislatures and determine whether they are consistent with the provisions of the Constitution. If a law is found to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court can declare it void.

Statement 2 is also correct. The High Courts in India have a dual jurisdiction: original and appellate.  Original jurisdiction refers to the power to hear cases directly, without any prior appeal from a lower court. Appellate jurisdiction means they can hear appeals against decisions of lower courts within their respective states or union territories.


**7. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**
    1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
    2. They aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are non-justiciable. This means that they cannot be directly enforced by courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the government to formulate policies and laws aimed at achieving social and economic justice.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs represent the socio-economic goals of the Indian Constitution. They aim to create a welfare state by promoting social and economic equality, providing social security, and improving the quality of life for all citizens.  They reflect the socialist and welfare-oriented ideals of the Constitution.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Rights:**
    1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
    2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to approach courts for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  For example, freedom of speech is subject to reasonable restrictions.  The balance between individual rights and societal needs is a key aspect of constitutional law.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 32 of the Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies. This is a crucial right that allows citizens to approach the Supreme Court or High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated.  This ensures the effective enforcement of fundamental rights and acts as a safeguard against state actions infringing upon them.



**9. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**
    1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister.
    2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, which includes the Annual Financial Statement and the Demands for Grants, is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Union Finance Minister.  This is a key event in the Indian parliamentary year.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha, while it can discuss and make recommendations on a Money Bill, does not have the power to amend it. The Lok Sabha has the sole authority to pass a Money Bill, and the Rajya Sabha's role is limited to suggesting amendments.  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these suggestions.


**10. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**
    1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
    2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. This appointment is a crucial aspect of the relationship between the Union and State governments in India's federal structure.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means the President can remove the Governor at any time, although this power is rarely exercised. The phrase reflects the ultimate authority of the Union government over the state government.  The Governor acts as a representative of the President at the state level.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**
    1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
    2. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and the State governments.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is appointed by the President of India. This appointment is made for a fixed term, and the CAG enjoys significant independence in carrying out their duties.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union government and the State governments. This ensures accountability and transparency in government spending at both levels. The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and state legislatures respectively, playing a crucial role in parliamentary oversight.


**12. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**
    1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all States.
    2.  The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 provides for a three-tier Panchayati Raj system (Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the intermediate level, and Zila Parishad at the district level) in all states.  This constitutional recognition aimed to empower local self-governance in rural areas.  However, the structure and specific details may vary somewhat from state to state.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Gram Sabha, a crucial component of the Panchayati Raj system, is defined as a body comprising all persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village.  It plays an important role in local governance and decision-making.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Duties:**
    1. Fundamental Duties are enforceable by courts of law.
    2. They were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable by courts of law. They are moral obligations on citizens to contribute to the nation's progress and well-being.  The non-justiciable nature of these duties reflects their aspirational character.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  This amendment also added the words "socialist," "secular," and "integrity" to the Preamble.  The inclusion of Fundamental Duties aimed to instill a sense of national responsibility and civic duty among citizens.


**14. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**
    1. The NGT has been established by an Act of Parliament.
    2. The NGT has the power to hear appeals against the orders of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  It is a specialized tribunal designed to handle environmental disputes more efficiently.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NGT deals with environmental issues and does not have the power to hear appeals against the orders of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).  The NGT's jurisdiction is related to environmental matters, but the appeals process for CPCB orders would typically go through the regular judicial system.  The NGT itself is intended to reduce the burden on higher courts.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act:**
    1. The RTI Act guarantees the right to access information held by public authorities.
    2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is responsible for hearing appeals against the decisions of public authorities under the RTI Act.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation that empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities. This promotes transparency and accountability in governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a statutory body established under the RTI Act. It is responsible for hearing appeals from citizens who are dissatisfied with the response received from public authorities regarding their requests for information.  The CIC plays a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of the RTI Act.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the reservation of one-third of the seats in Panchayats for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act stipulates that the procedure for maintaining accounts and auditing of Panchayats should be determined by the State Legislature, not the Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, introduced several provisions related to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), including the mandatory reservation of at least one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats at all levels for women.  This reservation is in addition to any reservations provided for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).  The aim is to ensure greater participation of women in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 73rd Amendment Act does address the issue of accounts and audit of PRIs, it does not assign this responsibility to the State Governor. The Act empowers the state legislature to make provisions regarding the maintenance of accounts, preparation of budgets, and auditing procedures for Panchayats.  The actual mechanisms are determined by state laws enacted under the framework provided by the amendment.  The Governor's role is primarily related to the appointment of the State Election Commission and other constitutional matters.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Parliament concerning the reorganization of states, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can alter the boundaries of any state without the consent of the state legislature concerned, provided the President's prior recommendation is obtained.
2.  The power of Parliament under Article 3 to diminish the area of a state includes the power to cede Indian territory to a foreign country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution grants Parliament the power to form new states, increase or diminish the area of any state, alter the boundaries of any state, or alter the name of any state.  While the President's prior recommendation is mandatory before a bill concerning these changes can be introduced in Parliament, and the state legislature's views are sought, Parliament is not bound by these views.  The ultimate power to reorganize states rests with the Parliament, even without the explicit consent of the affected state legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court of India, in a 1960 Presidential Reference concerning the Berubari Union case, clarified that the power under Article 3 to diminish the area of a state does *not* extend to ceding Indian territory to a foreign country.  Such cession requires a constitutional amendment under Article 368, as it involves a fundamental change in the territory of India.  This is a crucial distinction, highlighting the limitations of Parliament's power under Article 3.


**3. With reference to the Union Territories of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Union Territories are under the direct control and administration of the Central Government, unlike States which share power with the Centre.
2. The executive head of a Union Territory is always designated as the Lieutenant Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The fundamental difference between States and Union Territories lies in their relationship with the Central Government. States have a federal relationship with the Centre, sharing power as defined in the Constitution. Union Territories, on the other hand, are directly administered by the Central Government, which has greater control over their legislative and executive functions. This reflects the unitary nature of their governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Lieutenant Governor is a common designation for the executive head of many Union Territories, it is not universally applicable.  The executive head of a Union Territory can be a Lieutenant Governor, an Administrator, or a Chief Commissioner, depending on the specific provisions of the Constitution and any subsequent legislation concerning that Union Territory.  The designation reflects the varying degrees of autonomy granted to different Union Territories.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to those of the President of India.
2. The Governor always acts with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor shares some similarities with the President in terms of powers, there are significant differences.  The Governor's powers are primarily related to the state government, whereas the President's powers are at the national level. The Governor does not have independent judicial powers; judicial power rests solely with the judiciary. The Governor's executive powers are largely exercised through the Council of Ministers.  The analogy between the President and the Governor's powers is limited and not complete.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor is constitutionally bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers in most matters of state administration.  This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system of government at the state level, ensuring the accountability of the executive to the legislature.  However, there are certain exceptions where the Governor may exercise discretionary powers, such as in the appointment of the Chief Minister.


**5. With reference to the functioning of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha cannot amend it.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to vote on the demands for grants included in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 110 of the Indian Constitution defines a Money Bill.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha's power is limited to recommending amendments; it cannot amend a Money Bill. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations. This reflects the principle of financial control vested in the lower house, which represents the people directly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on the demands for grants included in the Union Budget. The power to vote on demands for grants (approving the government's expenditure) is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the Budget and make recommendations, but it cannot reject or amend the demands for grants.  This is another aspect of the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters.


**6. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a single-member body.  While it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), it also includes other Election Commissioners. The number of Election Commissioners can vary depending on the needs of the ECI. The ECI functions as a collegium, ensuring checks and balances in the conduct of elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does not decide the election schedule. The Election Commission of India is an independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India. It is the ECI that determines the election schedule for general elections and by-elections, ensuring impartiality in the electoral process.  The Home Ministry's role is limited to providing logistical support, not deciding the schedule.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.
2. The CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG does not compile and maintain the accounts of state governments.  While the CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State governments, the responsibility for compiling and maintaining these accounts rests with the respective governments themselves. The CAG's role is to audit these accounts to ensure their accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG is an independent constitutional authority, and its primary responsibility is to audit the accounts of the Union and State governments.  The CAG is accountable to the Parliament and reports to both Houses of Parliament. This independence ensures that the CAG can conduct audits without fear or favor, providing crucial oversight of public finances.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the President's Rule in a State:**

1. The proclamation of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The proclamation of President's Rule necessarily leads to the removal of the Council of Ministers in the State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's Rule under Article 356 of the Constitution does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly. While the Assembly can be dissolved, it is not mandatory.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place while the state is under President's Rule or dissolve it depending on the circumstances and the assessment of the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Similarly, the proclamation of President's Rule does not automatically lead to the removal of the Council of Ministers. While the existing Council of Ministers usually ceases to function,  it's not a mandatory consequence of the proclamation. The President can appoint an advisory council or allow the existing council to continue temporarily under certain circumstances before constituting a new council. The decision depends on the specific situation and the assessment by the central government.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Cabinet" is explicitly mentioned in Article 74.
2. Article 75 deals with the appointment of the Prime Minister and other Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(c) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term "Cabinet" is not explicitly mentioned in Article 74 of the Indian Constitution, which deals with the Council of Ministers. Although Article 74 discusses the position of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, it does not explicitly mention the term "Cabinet," which is used informally to refer to a smaller group of senior ministers within the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 75 of the Indian Constitution deals with the appointment of the Prime Minister and other ministers. It specifies that the Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.  This article lays down the foundational principles for the composition of the executive branch of the government.


**10. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament of India can add any law to the Ninth Schedule.
2. Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament of India has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. This power was originally intended to protect land reforms and other legislation from judicial scrutiny. However, the use of the Ninth Schedule has been subject to criticism, as it has been used to shield various laws, some of which have been subsequently declared unconstitutional by the courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court in several landmark judgments has held that even laws in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review.  The Court has asserted its power to examine the constitutionality of such laws, particularly if they violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution.  Therefore, the immunity from judicial review is not absolute.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates the reservation of one-third of seats in Panchayats for women, irrespective of seats reserved for SC and ST women.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act stipulates that the procedure for maintaining accounts and auditing municipal bodies will be determined by the respective State Legislature, not the Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act, while mandating reservations for women in Panchayats, specifies that this reservation is *in addition* to the reservation of seats for SC and ST women.  The total number of reserved seats for women will exceed one-third if the number of SC and ST women exceeds the one-third quota. The statement misrepresents this crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act concerning municipalities empowers the State Legislature to decide the procedure for maintaining accounts and conducting audits. The Governor does not have this power; it rests with the elected legislative body of the state.  This reflects the principle of legislative autonomy within the Indian federal structure.  The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision. Option (b) is thus the only correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the provisions of the 73rd and 74th Amendments or fail to accurately capture the allocation of powers.


**2. With reference to the provisions of the 74th Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nagar Panchayats are constituted only in areas with a population exceeding 20,000, as per the 74th Amendment Act.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act mandates periodic elections to municipalities every five years, ensuring regular democratic representation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act does not specify a minimum population threshold of 20,000 for the constitution of Nagar Panchayats.  The population criteria for establishing Nagar Panchayats vary across states and are determined by state-specific legislation, not a fixed national standard. The statement presents a false, specific population figure.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act introduces a crucial element of democratic accountability by mandating regular periodic elections to municipalities, typically held every five years. This ensures that urban governance remains responsive to the needs and desires of the electorate. The statement accurately reflects this vital aspect of the Act. Option (b) is therefore the correct choice. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain inaccurate information or fail to capture the essence of the 74th Amendment's provisions regarding municipal elections.


**3. With reference to the constitutional framework of local governance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act grants Gram Sabhas the power to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.
2. The 74th Amendment Act empowers the State Governor to decide the manner of maintaining accounts and conducting audits of municipal bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act empowers Gram Sabhas in various ways, the power to prevent land alienation in Scheduled Areas is primarily vested in other bodies, such as the District Collector or other state-level authorities depending on the state's specific laws.  The statement incorrectly attributes this power solely to the Gram Sabha, which is not a comprehensive or accurate reflection of the legal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act does not grant the State Governor the authority to determine the methods of accounting and auditing for municipal bodies.  This power is usually vested in the State Legislature, reflecting the principle of legislative autonomy within the Indian federal system. The statement incorrectly assigns this power to the Governor, a misrepresentation of the constitutional arrangement.  Both statements are inaccurate; hence, (d) is the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly attribute powers to either the Gram Sabha or the Governor.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates that one-third of the seats in Panchayats be reserved for women, excluding the seats reserved for SC and ST women. This means the total number of reserved seats can exceed one-third.
2. The 74th Amendment Act empowers the State Governor to decide the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservations for women in Panchayats. Importantly, this reservation is *additional* to the reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).  Therefore, the total number of reserved seats could indeed exceed one-third of the total seats. The statement accurately describes this key aspect of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 74th Amendment Act does not grant the State Governor the power to determine the accounting and audit procedures for municipalities.  This authority generally rests with the State Legislature, reflecting the principle of legislative autonomy within the Indian federal framework. The statement wrongly attributes this legislative function to the executive branch (the Governor). Option (a) is the correct answer because only statement 1 is accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2 or the misinterpretation of the combined statements.


**5. With reference to the constitutional provisions related to urban local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The 74th Amendment Act establishes Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas, defining their structure and functions.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act mandates that the State Governor shall decide the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act introduces a constitutional framework for urban local bodies, including the establishment of Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas.  The Act details their constitution, powers, and functions, providing a legal foundation for their operation.  The statement accurately reflects this crucial aspect of the Amendment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act does not vest the power to determine accounting and audit procedures in the State Governor.  This authority usually resides with the State Legislature, reflecting the principle of legislative autonomy within the Indian federal structure. The statement misattributes this legislative power to the executive branch (the Governor).  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the provisions of the 74th Amendment or incorrectly assign powers to the Governor.


**6. With reference to the powers of the Governor in the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor's power to make rules regarding the conduct of the state government's business is a discretionary power, not subject to ministerial advice.
2. The Governor's power to appoint ministers is entirely discretionary, independent of the advice of the Chief Minister or the majority party in the state legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor has certain discretionary powers, the power to make rules regarding the conduct of state government business is generally exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Governor's discretionary powers are limited and exceptional, not the norm in the day-to-day functioning of the state government.  The statement misrepresents the extent of the Governor's discretionary powers in this regard.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor's power to appoint ministers is not entirely discretionary.  In practice, the Governor acts on the advice of the Chief Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party in the state legislature.  The Governor's role is primarily formal in this context; the real power lies with the elected Chief Minister. The statement incorrectly portrays the Governor's role as solely discretionary, ignoring the established conventions of the Indian parliamentary system.  Both statements are inaccurate; therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is responsible for laying the recommendations of the Finance Commission before each House of Parliament.
2.  The Union Budget is prepared and presented to Parliament by the Department of Revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution mandates that the President, as the head of state, is responsible for presenting the Finance Commission's recommendations to both Houses of Parliament. This ensures transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of the Commission's crucial financial advice. The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in tax collection and revenue management, the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, specifically the Department of Economic Affairs. The statement incorrectly assigns this crucial governmental function to the wrong department.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the constitutional role of the President or incorrectly identify the government department responsible for the Union Budget.


**8. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. A no-confidence motion can be moved against individual ministers in the Lok Sabha.
2. A censure motion requires a higher majority than a no-confidence motion to be passed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A no-confidence motion in the Indian parliamentary system is directed at the entire Council of Ministers, not individual ministers.  While individual ministers can be questioned and criticized, a no-confidence motion targets the government's collective responsibility. The statement misrepresents the target of a no-confidence motion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A censure motion and a no-confidence motion both require a simple majority to pass. There is no difference in the threshold for passage between these two types of motions. The statement incorrectly suggests a difference in the required majority.  Both statements are inaccurate, making (d) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the target of a no-confidence motion or the majority requirements for both motions.


**9. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed in a state under Article 356 of the Constitution of India if the constitutional machinery in that state breaks down.
2. The imposition of the President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 356 of the Indian Constitution allows for the imposition of President's rule in a state if the constitutional machinery breaks down. This provision is intended to address situations where the state government is unable to function effectively or is acting against the interests of the Constitution. The statement accurately reflects the purpose and application of Article 356.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the imposition of President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it is not an automatic consequence.  The decision to dissolve the assembly rests with the President, who may choose to keep the assembly in place under certain circumstances. The statement inaccurately portrays the dissolution of the assembly as an automatic outcome of President's rule. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2 or the misinterpretation of the combined statements.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The power of the Supreme Court of India to decide disputes between the Centre and the States falls under its appellate jurisdiction.
2. The power to increase the number of judges in the Supreme Court of India is vested in the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's power to adjudicate disputes between the Centre and the States falls under its *original* jurisdiction, as defined in Article 131 of the Constitution. Appellate jurisdiction deals with appeals from lower courts; original jurisdiction refers to cases that are directly filed in the Supreme Court. The statement mistakenly assigns this power to the wrong jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power to increase the number of judges in the Supreme Court of India rests with the Parliament, not the Chief Justice of India.  While the Chief Justice's opinion may be sought and considered, the ultimate authority to alter the court's composition lies with the legislative branch. The statement incorrectly assigns this power to the Chief Justice.  Both statements are incorrect; therefore, (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**11. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when requested by the President of India.
2. The UPSC's functions can be extended by the Prime Minister of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state not only at the request of the President but also at the request of the Governor of that state, with the approval of the President. The statement is too restrictive and doesn't reflect the full range of circumstances under which the UPSC can assist a state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UPSC's functions can be extended not by the Prime Minister but by an act of Parliament. The statement incorrectly attributes this power to the executive branch.  Both statements are therefore incorrect, making (d) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the circumstances under which the UPSC can assist a state or the process of extending its functions.


**12. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India mentions the term "Cabinet" explicitly.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is responsible for compiling and maintaining the accounts of state governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term "Cabinet" is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India. While the Constitution discusses the Council of Ministers and its relationship with the President or Governor, the term "Cabinet" is a convention of the parliamentary system.  The statement misrepresents the constitutional mention of the term.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG's responsibilities include auditing the accounts of both the Union and State governments, ensuring financial accountability and transparency. The statement accurately reflects this crucial role of the CAG. Option (b) is therefore the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the constitutional status of the Cabinet or incorrectly describe the CAG's responsibilities.


**13. With reference to the powers of the Parliament in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India for implementing international treaties without the consent of any state.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to vote on the demands for grants included in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament's power to legislate on matters related to international treaties is a crucial aspect of India's sovereignty.  It can enact laws for the entire country or any part thereof to implement these treaties without needing the individual consent of each state. The statement accurately reflects this power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha, being the Upper House, does not have the power to vote on the demands for grants. This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha, the Lower House, reflecting the principle of financial control being primarily vested in the directly elected body. The statement incorrectly attributes this power to the Rajya Sabha.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the Parliament's treaty-making powers or incorrectly describe the Rajya Sabha's role in financial matters.


**14. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution does not fix the number of members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC hold office for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution does not specify the exact number of members for the UPSC. The number is determined by the government through executive action, although there are provisions within the Constitution guiding the composition of the commission. The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chairman and members of the UPSC do not hold office for six years. Their term is six years or until they attain the age of 60, whichever is earlier. The statement contains an incorrect detail regarding the age limit. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the constitutional provision regarding the UPSC's composition or contain inaccurate information about the term of office.


**15.  With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC's reports are presented to the President of India.
2. The NCSC has the power to summon and examine witnesses and receive evidence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) submits its reports to the President of India, who then presents them to Parliament. This ensures that the Commission's findings on issues related to Scheduled Castes receive parliamentary attention and scrutiny. The statement accurately reflects this process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The NCSC possesses investigative powers, including the ability to summon and examine witnesses and receive evidence, to effectively investigate complaints and grievances related to Scheduled Castes. The statement accurately reflects these investigative powers.  Both statements are correct; therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the complete range of the NCSC's functions and reporting mechanisms.



**1. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a money bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a money bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, is the upper house of the Indian Parliament.  While it has significant legislative powers, its role in financial matters is limited compared to the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  Statement 1 is incorrect because only the Lok Sabha can initiate a money bill.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Rajya Sabha cannot reject a money bill. It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected lower house.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to provide scrutiny and review of legislation, including money bills, but it lacks the power to ultimately veto them.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President can dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The President can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Although the President is the head of state,  the Indian system operates on the principle of responsible government. This means the executive branch, headed by the Prime Minister, is accountable to the Parliament. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, and therefore, dissolving the Lok Sabha is done on the Prime Minister's recommendation. Statement 2 is also correct. The President has the power to nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, representing experts in various fields of art, literature, science, and social service. This provision ensures that the Rajya Sabha includes individuals with specialized knowledge and experience beyond the purely political representation elected by state legislatures.


**3. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are not justiciable. While they guide the state's actions towards social and economic justice, they are not legally enforceable by courts.  Their non-justiciable nature reflects the balancing act in the Constitution between individual rights and the state's role in social and economic development.  Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs are intended to create a welfare state, where the government actively works to improve the lives of its citizens through social security measures, economic equality, and social justice.  The DPSPs embody the social and economic goals of the Indian Constitution, providing a framework for the state to pursue these objectives, even though their implementation isn't subject to judicial review.


**4. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a unitary system with federal features.
2. The distribution of powers between the Union and States is based on the Government of India Act, 1935.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is broadly correct.  While India is a federal state, its federalism is characterized by a strong central government, unlike a purely symmetrical federal system. This asymmetry allows for greater central control in certain areas, reflecting the historical context and the need for national unity and integration. This is often described as a "quasi-federal" or "unitary system with federal features".   Statement 2 is also correct.  The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a significant blueprint for the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in the Indian Constitution.  Though modified and adapted, many of its provisions on federal structure influenced the framing of the Indian Constitution.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a five-member body.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is not a five-member body; it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and currently has two other Election Commissioners. The number of Election Commissioners can be changed by the government, but it's not fixed at five. Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is constitutionally mandated to supervise, direct, and control the conduct of elections to Parliament and state legislatures.  This includes setting the election schedule for both general elections and by-elections.  The Commission's independence and impartiality are crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.


**6. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. They are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2. They are enforceable by courts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed by the Constitution, are not absolute.  Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security of the state, etc., as outlined in the Constitution itself. The balance between individual liberty and societal needs is a key aspect of the interpretation and application of Fundamental Rights. Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.  Individuals can approach the courts if their Fundamental Rights are violated. This judicial review is a crucial safeguard for upholding these rights and ensuring their protection against state action.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President for a fixed term.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President for a term of six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure ensures the CAG's independence from political influence and allows them to perform their duties without fear or favor. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of not only the Union Government but also those of the state governments and other government bodies. The CAG's role is to ensure financial accountability and transparency across the entire government apparatus.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of public finances.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha first.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a money bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union Budget, which includes the Annual Financial Statement and the Appropriation Bill, is presented first in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters, as it is the house of the people and directly elected. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill.  It can only suggest amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial legislation is a fundamental aspect of the Indian parliamentary system.  The Rajya Sabha's role is to provide scrutiny and review, but it cannot ultimately veto a money bill.


**9. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President.
2. The Governor's term is for five years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Statement 1 is correct: The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. This appointment is a significant aspect of the relationship between the Union and the States, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian Constitution.  Statement 2 is also correct: The Governor holds office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office. However, the Governor can be removed from office earlier by the President, if they so choose.  This is a key element of the balance of power between the center and the states.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States.
2. The Supreme Court judges retire at the age of 62.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States. This original jurisdiction highlights the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional disputes and inter-state relations. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The retirement age for Supreme Court judges is 65 years, not 62. This retirement age is crucial for maintaining the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.  The relatively high retirement age is designed to ensure that judges have sufficient experience and tenure to handle complex cases and maintain judicial consistency.





**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Union Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and other Ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, and not to the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then advises the President on the appointment of other Ministers. This reflects the parliamentary system where the executive is responsible to the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Rajya Sabha can question and scrutinize the Council of Ministers' actions, the ultimate responsibility lies with the Lok Sabha. A vote of no confidence can only be moved in the Lok Sabha, leading to the resignation or dismissal of the government if it fails.  The Rajya Sabha's power is primarily legislative, not executive control.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor can reserve any bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.
2. The Governor can promulgate ordinances even when the State Legislature is in session.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration. This power acts as a safeguard against State legislation that might conflict with national interests or the Constitution.  The President may give assent, withhold assent, or return the bill for reconsideration.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Governors have the power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of the State Legislature, they cannot do so when the Legislature is in session.  Ordinances are essentially temporary laws, used to address urgent matters when the Legislature is not functioning.  Promulgating ordinances while the Legislature is active undermines the legislative process.



**3. With reference to the composition and functions of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution mandates that at least half of the members of the UPSC should have held office under the Government of India or a State for at least five years.
2. The UPSC’s jurisdiction can be extended by Parliament to cover personnel matters of local authorities and other public institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not specify that at least half the members of the UPSC must have held government office for five years. While experience in government service is desirable, the Constitution emphasizes the importance of expertise and impartiality in the selection process, not a specific numerical requirement based on prior government experience.

Statement 2 is correct. Parliament has the power to extend the UPSC's jurisdiction to encompass personnel matters of local authorities, corporate bodies, or other public institutions. This allows the UPSC to maintain consistent standards across various levels of public service, enhancing transparency and meritocracy.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):**

1. The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by outlining the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be directly enforced by courts. They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies and legislation aimed at social and economic justice.  While courts cannot compel the state to implement them, they can influence policy indirectly by interpreting other laws in light of the DPSPs' spirit.

Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs are a set of non-justiciable principles that guide the state in creating a welfare state. They outline the state's responsibility in providing social and economic justice, including provisions for education, healthcare, and fair wages.  They aim to create a society where fundamental rights are enjoyed equitably.


**5. With reference to the powers and functions of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can introduce and pass money bills.
2. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution by a simple majority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Only the Lok Sabha can introduce and pass money bills. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha on a money bill within 14 days of its receipt, but it cannot amend or reject it.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Amending the Constitution requires more than a simple majority.  The process and the required majority vary depending on the nature of the amendment.  Some amendments require a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament and ratification by at least half of the State Legislatures.  This ensures that significant constitutional changes are not made lightly.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India is a constitutionally mandated body that comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners, whose number can be decided by the President.  This structure ensures a degree of collective decision-making and reduces the scope for bias.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislative Assemblies, and the President and Vice-President of India.  It also plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and resolving election-related disputes.


**7. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States is based on the scheme provided in the Government of India Act, 1935.
2. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India contains three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a significant precedent for the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States in the Indian Constitution.  While the Indian Constitution is not a mere replica, it adopted the basic framework of three lists – Union, State and Concurrent – from the 1935 Act.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the division of legislative powers between the Union and the States.  The Union List contains subjects on which only the Parliament can legislate; the State List contains subjects on which only the State Legislatures can legislate; and the Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Parliament and the State Legislatures can legislate.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The appointment is made according to the procedure laid down in the Constitution, ensuring the independence and impartiality of the office.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  This ensures that public funds are used efficiently and effectively at all levels of government, upholding transparency and accountability.  The CAG submits reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.



**9. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights only.
2. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and the States.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court is a major protector of Fundamental Rights and can issue writs for their enforcement, its writ jurisdiction extends beyond Fundamental Rights. It can issue writs for the enforcement of any legal right or to prevent injustice, even if not directly linked to a Fundamental Right.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States.

**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for the establishment of a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj Institutions in all States.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act aims to establish a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj Institutions, it does not mandate this structure for all States.  The specific structure and number of tiers can vary depending on the State's specific circumstances and population.  The Act provides a framework, but the States have some flexibility in its implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gram Sabha, as defined by the 73rd Amendment Act, is a body consisting of all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village located within the area of a village-level Panchayat.  It plays a crucial role in local governance and decision-making at the village level.


**11. With reference to the financial provisions of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Contingency Fund of India is established by the Parliament under Article 267 of the Constitution. This fund is meant to meet unforeseen expenditure, providing immediate financial resources in emergencies before the Parliament can authorize regular spending.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Finance Commission, established under Article 280, plays a crucial role in India's fiscal federalism.  It provides recommendations to the President on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States and the principles governing grants-in-aid to the States. These recommendations are crucial for maintaining financial balance within the federal system.



**12. Consider the following statements regarding the President's rule in a State:**

1. President's rule can be imposed only when the State government has lost the confidence of the State Legislature.
2. President's rule can be imposed for a maximum period of six months.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the breakdown of law and order or failure of the constitutional machinery are common reasons, President's rule can be imposed under Article 356 for various reasons.  It is not strictly limited to situations where the State government has lost the confidence of the Legislature.  Other factors, such as a threat to national security or complete breakdown of governance, can also trigger the imposition of President's rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  President's rule can be imposed initially for a maximum period of six months. However, it can be extended further with the approval of Parliament, with no constitutional limit on the total duration.  This allows for flexibility in addressing prolonged crises in the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The process of removing a Supreme Court Judge is initiated by a motion in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  This motion must specify the grounds for removal, which are usually "proven misbehavior" or "incapacity".  The motion's initiation in either house demonstrates the importance of parliamentary oversight in the judiciary's independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The motion for removal must be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the House where the motion is initiated, and also by a majority of the total membership of the other House.  This stringent requirement highlights the high threshold for removing a Supreme Court Judge, protecting the judiciary's independence from political pressures.



**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General of India has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, but without a right to vote.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India under Article 76 of the Constitution. The appointment is usually made on the advice of the Council of Ministers, ensuring the appointee aligns with the government's policies. The Attorney General holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Attorney General of India has the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, but not to vote. This privileged status allows them to provide legal advice and represent the government's interests effectively in Parliament.  The non-voting status maintains their impartiality as the government's chief legal advisor.


**15. With reference to the features of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution is a federal Constitution with a unitary bias.
2. The Indian Constitution incorporates both the parliamentary and presidential systems of government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is considered a federal constitution because of the division of powers between the Union and the States. However, it is also characterized by a unitary bias due to several factors, such as the strong position of the Union Government, the power of the Parliament to legislate on any subject in the State List, and the presence of All-India Services.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Constitution exhibits a blend of both parliamentary and presidential systems. The parliamentary system is evident in the Council of Ministers' responsibility to the Lok Sabha and the fusion of executive and legislative functions. The presidential system is reflected in the President's role as the Head of State, their power to appoint the Prime Minister, and their other executive powers.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body.
2. The NDC is chaired by the Prime Minister of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Statement 2 is correct. The NDC is chaired by the Prime Minister of India.  It serves as a forum for cooperative federalism, bringing together representatives from the Union and State Governments to discuss and coordinate national development plans. The Prime Minister's chairmanship emphasizes the central government's role in coordinating national development strategies.

2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, usually the leader of the party that commands a majority in the State Legislative Assembly.  This reflects the parliamentary system's principles, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly.  This means that the entire Council must resign if it loses the confidence of the Assembly. This principle ensures the accountability of the executive to the legislature.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment Act.
2. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment Act, 1951.  This was done to protect certain land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, as the Supreme Court had struck down some of them as violating fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially, laws in the Ninth Schedule were considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court later ruled that even laws included in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  This landmark judgment limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection.


**19. With reference to the powers and functions of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

2. The Parliament has the power to create new States and alter the boundaries of existing States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament possesses the power to legislate on any subject in the State List in the national interest, provided a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority. This demonstrates the Union's power to address matters of national importance, even if they fall under the State List's purview.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Parliament is explicitly empowered by the Constitution to form new States and alter the boundaries of existing States. This power reflects the Union's role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the nation's territorial boundaries.  This power requires specific procedures and considerations outlined in the Constitution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Its mandate included examining the distribution of legislative and financial powers, administrative relations, and the role of various institutions in the federal system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sarkaria Commission recommended a stronger role for the States in the decision-making process, advocating for greater autonomy and consultation with States on matters that affect them.  This recommendation emphasized the need for cooperative federalism and a more balanced distribution of power between the Union and the States, leading to better governance.


**1. With reference to the features of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of a single citizenship is borrowed from the British Constitution.
2. The federal scheme, including the office of the Governor, is primarily based on the Canadian Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution adopts a single citizenship model, meaning all citizens are citizens of India regardless of their state of residence. This feature is directly borrowed from the British Constitution's unitary structure.  Statement 1 is thus correct.  The Indian federal structure, while drawing inspiration from various sources, notably incorporates the Canadian model regarding the appointment of provincial governors (in India, Governors) by the central government and their role as representatives of the central authority in the states. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. The other options are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the constitutional borrowing from these sources.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state by outlining socioeconomic goals for the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are not justiciable.  While they guide the state's actions towards social and economic justice, they are not legally enforceable in courts like Fundamental Rights.  They serve as guidelines for policy-making and legislative action. Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs are designed to create a welfare state by directing the government to pursue social and economic policies that promote the well-being of citizens, including provisions for education, healthcare, and social security.  The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately describes the nature and purpose of DPSPs.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The distribution of powers between the Union and States is based on the Government of India Act, 1935.
2.  The system features a strong central government with significant powers over the states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The foundational framework for the division of powers between the Union and States in India's federal structure was laid down by the Government of India Act, 1935.  While the Indian Constitution significantly modified and improved upon this framework, it retained the fundamental principle of dividing governmental authority between the central and state levels.  Statement 2 is also correct.  India's federal system leans towards a strong central government, possessing significant powers in areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency, although the states retain considerable autonomy in their respective jurisdictions. The other options are incorrect as both statements accurately reflect characteristics of the Indian federal system and its historical roots.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the power of judicial review.

The Supreme Court, through the power of judicial review, has the authority to examine laws passed by the legislature and executive orders issued by the government. If a law or order is found to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can declare it void. The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 correctly describes a key function of the Supreme Court within India's constitutional framework.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college comprising only elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.

The President possesses the power of pardon, which can be exercised in cases involving punishments awarded by any court or tribunal within India. However, this power does not extend to cases of impeachment of judges, which is a separate constitutional process. The other options are incorrect as only statement 2 accurately reflects the President's constitutional powers.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners appointed by the President. This structure allows for collective decision-making and enhances the impartiality of the election process. Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECI's mandate encompasses the conduct of elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President. However, it also extends to elections to local bodies, ensuring uniformity and fairness across all levels of the electoral system. The other options are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately describes the composition and functions of the ECI.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

After this period, the bill is deemed passed by the Rajya Sabha, irrespective of their approval or rejection.  The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately describes the Rajya Sabha's power regarding Money Bills.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

The Union Budget is a comprehensive document encompassing both receipts (revenue from taxes, etc., and capital receipts from borrowings, etc.) and expenditure (revenue expenditure on salaries, etc., and capital expenditure on infrastructure, etc.)  The budget outlines the government's fiscal plans and its resource allocation strategies.  The other options are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the essential features of the Union Budget.

This ensures the CAG's independence and impartiality in auditing government accounts. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's auditing responsibilities extend to the accounts of the Union and State Governments, as well as those of local bodies and other government entities.  This comprehensive auditing ensures accountability and transparency across all levels of government.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country. It is the final court of appeal for all cases arising within India's jurisdiction.  Its decisions are binding on all other courts. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court hears appeals from High Courts, its original jurisdiction also allows it to hear certain cases directly, without going through a lower court.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that some questions may necessitate a deeper understanding of Indian Polity beyond the snippets provided.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution's approach to secularism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution adopts a model of secularism that emphasizes mutual exclusion between the state and religion, mirroring the Western model.
2.  The Constitution recognizes the importance of inter-community equality alongside individual equality, acknowledging the impact of community status on individual freedom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian model of secularism differs significantly from the Western model, which often prioritizes strict separation and mutual exclusion between the state and religion.  India's secularism actively engages with religious communities to promote equality and justice, even intervening where necessary to address discriminatory practices.  The text explicitly states that Indian secularism does *not* mean mutual exclusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution recognizes that individual freedom and dignity are deeply intertwined with the status and well-being of one's community.  Therefore, it grants rights not only to individuals but also to religious communities, ensuring a degree of equality among them. This is a key aspect of India's unique approach to secularism.  The text explicitly highlights this aspect.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Constituent Assembly of India:**

1.  The Constituent Assembly was dominated by lawyers and politicians, leading to criticisms about its representativeness and the complexity of the Constitution.
2.  The Constituent Assembly's composition reflected a significant Hindu majority, a fact noted by observers like Lord Viscount Simon and Winston Churchill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect criticisms leveled against the Constituent Assembly.  Statement 1 highlights the concern that the Assembly's dominance by lawyers and politicians might have resulted in a complex and less accessible Constitution, potentially neglecting the concerns of other societal segments.  This is a valid critique of the Assembly's composition and its impact on the final document.

Statement 2 correctly points out the disproportionate Hindu representation in the Assembly, a concern raised by prominent figures like Lord Viscount Simon and Winston Churchill.  This demographic imbalance raised questions about the Assembly's ability to represent the diverse interests of all Indian communities effectively.  The text provides this information.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes a symmetrical federal system, similar to that of the United States, ensuring equal legal status and prerogatives for all constituent units.
2.  Articles 370 (related to Jammu and Kashmir) and 371 (related to the Northeast) exemplify the concept of asymmetric federalism, acknowledging the unique needs of certain regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian federal system is explicitly described as *asymmetrical*, unlike the symmetrical federalism seen in the United States.  This asymmetry reflects the diverse historical, geographical, and cultural contexts of India's constituent units.  The central government holds significant power, and the legal status and powers of states vary.

Statement 2 is correct.  Articles 370 and 371 are prime examples of asymmetric federalism in the Indian Constitution. They provide special provisions and greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir (before its revocation) and certain Northeastern states respectively, recognizing their unique circumstances and needs.  The text explicitly mentions this.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC):**

1. The NCRWC was headed by M.N. Venkatachaliah, a former Chief Justice of India, and submitted its report in 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the NCRWC was chaired by M.N. Venkatachaliah and submitted its report in 2002.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCRWC's mandate was to *review* the working of the Constitution, not to rewrite it.  While it could recommend changes, these recommendations were bound by the framework of parliamentary democracy and the preservation of the Constitution's basic structure.  The text clearly states that the commission's task was to review, not rewrite.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to property was initially included as a Fundamental Right but was later removed through a constitutional amendment.
2.  The Supreme Court has played a significant role in interpreting and expanding the scope of Fundamental Rights, shaping their application in various contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The right to property was initially a Fundamental Right (Article 31), but the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed it from the list of Fundamental Rights, making it a legal right under Article 300-A.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Supreme Court has consistently played a crucial role in interpreting and expanding the scope of Fundamental Rights, ensuring their effectiveness and applicability in diverse situations.  Its judgments have significantly shaped the understanding and implementation of these rights, adding layers of meaning and protection.  The text implies this through discussions of judicial review and court cases.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Indian Constitution's Schedules:**

1. The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution protects laws included in it from judicial review, regardless of when they were added.
2. The Tenth Schedule, added by the 52nd Amendment Act (Anti-Defection Law), deals with the disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on grounds of defection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ninth Schedule initially provided immunity from judicial review, the Supreme Court later clarified that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, introduced by the 52nd Amendment Act, deals with the disqualification of legislators for defection, a significant aspect of Indian parliamentary politics.  The text explicitly confirms this.



**7. With reference to the Indian political system, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of coalition politics in the 1990s marked a significant shift from the earlier dominance of the Congress party, leading to a more multi-party system.
2. The Mandal Commission's recommendations, implemented in 1990, sparked widespread protests and significantly influenced the political landscape, particularly regarding the representation of Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe crucial developments in Indian politics.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the decline of Congress dominance and the emergence of a more fragmented and coalition-based political system in the 1990s.  This is a major shift in the Indian political landscape.

Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting the impact of the Mandal Commission's recommendations on OBC reservations. The implementation of these recommendations triggered significant political and social upheaval, profoundly influencing political mobilization and party strategies. The text describes these events.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judiciary's role:**

1. The "basic structure" doctrine, first articulated in the Kesavananda Bharati case, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, reserving certain fundamental aspects from alteration.
2.  Judicial activism, through the invention of the "basic structure" doctrine and subsequent judgments, has played a significant role in shaping India's democracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the Indian Judiciary's significant role. Statement 1 correctly describes the "basic structure" doctrine, which emerged from the Kesavananda Bharati case and restricts Parliament's amending power. This doctrine protects the core principles and values of the Constitution from being fundamentally altered.

Statement 2 is also correct. Judicial activism, particularly through the "basic structure" doctrine, has been instrumental in safeguarding democratic ideals and values, influencing the trajectory of Indian democracy.  The text directly or indirectly supports both statements.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution's Preamble, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble, as it stands today, includes the terms "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," added through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976.
2. The Preamble is based on the Objectives Resolution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate. Statement 1 correctly identifies the addition of "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment. This amendment significantly altered the Preamble's wording and emphasis.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Preamble's core values and objectives are rooted in Nehru's Objectives Resolution, which served as a foundational document for the Constituent Assembly's deliberations.  The text explicitly mentions this.


**10. With reference to the concept of "cooperative federalism" in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cooperative federalism emphasizes a hierarchical relationship between the Centre and the States, with the Centre holding ultimate authority.
2. The concept of cooperative federalism aims to address shortcomings in the existing federal structure by promoting greater collaboration and shared responsibility between the Centre and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cooperative federalism, unlike a strictly hierarchical approach, emphasizes collaboration and mutual respect between the Centre and the States.  It does not imply that the Centre holds ultimate authority, but rather that the Centre and the States work together to achieve common goals.

Statement 2 is correct. Cooperative federalism aims to improve the existing federal structure by fostering better coordination, information sharing, and joint decision-making between the Centre and the States to overcome the drawbacks of the existing system. The text mentions cooperative federalism.


**11. Consider the following statements about the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for resolving disputes related to the splits and mergers of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chief Election Commissioner heads the Election Commission of India, it's not always a single-member body.  It can include other Election Commissioners, depending on the needs and workload.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission plays a crucial role in resolving disputes concerning the division or merger of recognized political parties, ensuring the integrity and stability of the political system.  The text implies this.



**12. With reference to the Indian President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can proclaim a Financial Emergency under specific circumstances outlined in the Constitution.
2.  The President's rule (Article 356) automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly when imposed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President has the power to proclaim a Financial Emergency under Article 360 of the Constitution when there is a threat to the financial stability of the nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's rule under Article 356 can lead to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it doesn't automatically happen. The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President, and it is not a mandatory consequence of imposing President's rule.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG's powers to audit government accounts are derived from Article 149 of the Constitution.
2.  The CAG's audit extends only to the financial aspects of government functioning and does not include an assessment of policy implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 149 of the Constitution provides the constitutional basis for the CAG's powers to audit the accounts of the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's audit is not limited to financial accounts; it also extends to the performance audit, which examines the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs and policies. The CAG's reports often include observations on policy implementation.


**14. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the ruling party.
2.  Private member's bills have frequently been passed into law in the history of the Indian Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.  This distinguishes them from government bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Private member's bills rarely become law in India due to various factors, including limited parliamentary time and the government's agenda.  The success rate of private member's bills is very low.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judicial System:**

1. Judicial review in India refers to the Judiciary's power to assess the wisdom and policy considerations behind laws passed by the Legislature.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has the power to pronounce on the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India focuses on the *constitutionality* of laws and executive actions, not on evaluating their wisdom or policy merit.  The Court assesses whether a law conforms to the Constitution, not whether it is good policy.

Statement 2 is correct. Judicial review is a fundamental power of the Supreme Court of India, allowing it to determine the validity of laws and executive orders in relation to the Constitution.  This is a core element of India's judicial system.


**16. With reference to the Right to Information Act in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Information Act ensures that citizens have the right to access information held by public authorities.
2.  The Act provides for penalties for public authorities that fail to provide information within the stipulated time frame.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Right to Information Act. Statement 1 correctly states the core purpose of the Act: to empower citizens by granting them access to information held by public authorities. This promotes transparency and accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act includes provisions for penalties against public authorities that fail to comply with requests for information or unreasonably delay responses. This mechanism helps ensure the Act's effectiveness.  The text does not contain this information but it is a known fact.


**17. Consider the following statements about the features of Indian Federalism:**

1. Indian federalism is characterized by a strong central government, with significant power vested in the Union.
2.  The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature, with the Rajya Sabha representing the States unequally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian federal system leans towards a strong Centre, reflecting a unitary bias. This is a key characteristic of Indian federalism, distinguishing it from more symmetrical federal systems.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rajya Sabha, representing the States, has unequal representation among different states, with larger states having more representatives than smaller ones.  This unequal representation reflects the historical and demographic realities of India.


**18. With reference to the Indian Constitution's Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are legally enforceable rights, similar to Fundamental Rights.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to guide the State in formulating policies that promote social and economic justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles are not legally enforceable rights.  They serve as guidelines for the State to follow while formulating policies, aiming to create a more just and equitable society.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles provide a framework for the State to pursue social and economic justice. They guide policymaking and are intended to improve the lives of citizens by addressing social and economic inequalities.


**19. Consider the following statements about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC's recommendations are binding on the government and must be implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established by an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The NHRC's recommendations are not legally binding on the government. While they carry significant moral weight and influence, the government is not obligated to implement them.


**20. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  Panchayati Raj Institutions are primarily political institutions and have not been effective instruments of governance in the absence of a well-educated and organized local government system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act enshrined the three-tier Panchayati Raj system in the Constitution, aiming to decentralize power and improve governance at the local level.

Statement 2 is also correct. The effectiveness of Panchayati Raj Institutions has been hampered by various factors, including a lack of education and organization among local government personnel, leading to their functioning primarily as political entities rather than effective instruments of governance.  The text hints at this.






**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs is solely responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated to ensure free and fair elections.  It currently comprises a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, appointed by the President of India.  While the number of commissioners can be altered by Parliament, the core structure remains a multi-member body headed by the CEC.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ministry of Home Affairs plays a supporting role in election administration, the ECI is the ultimate authority in scheduling elections. The ECI independently decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections, taking into account various factors like logistical considerations and the availability of security forces.  The Home Ministry provides logistical and security support, but it does not have the power to determine the election schedule.  This independence is crucial for maintaining the impartiality and integrity of the electoral process.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The removal of the Council of Ministers is a necessary consequence of the President's rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an automatic consequence. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in session, especially if there is a possibility of forming a stable government.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President, who may consider various factors before making this decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The removal of the Council of Ministers is a common practice during President's rule, but it is not mandatory. The President can choose to retain the existing Council of Ministers or appoint a new one if deemed necessary. The primary objective of President's rule is to restore constitutional governance; the fate of the Council of Ministers is secondary and dependent on the specific circumstances.


**3. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by the equal representation of all federating units in the Rajya Sabha.
2.  The Indian federal structure is primarily a result of a formal agreement among the federating units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian federal system does not provide for equal representation of all states in the Rajya Sabha.  The representation of states in the Rajya Sabha is based on population, with larger states having a greater number of representatives. This unequal representation reflects a compromise between the principles of federalism and the need for a strong national government.  While the Rajya Sabha is meant to represent the states, it is not designed to provide equal representation to each state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian federal structure is not solely a result of a formal agreement among the states.  It was established through a process of constitutional drafting and adoption, reflecting a complex interaction between the constituent assembly, the British government, and the aspirations of various regions and groups.  While negotiations and compromises certainly played a role, it was ultimately a constitutional process, not a purely contractual agreement.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Parliament of India's control over the Council of Ministers:**

1. The adjournment motion is the primary mechanism used by Parliament to exercise control over the Council of Ministers.
2. Question Hour and supplementary questions are effective tools for parliamentary oversight of the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the adjournment motion can be used to express dissatisfaction with the government's actions, it's not the primary means of exercising control.  It's a disruptive tool, primarily used by the opposition to raise urgent matters of public importance.  It doesn't provide for a detailed examination of government policy.  Other mechanisms, such as no-confidence motions, are more direct ways of expressing a lack of confidence.

Statement 2 is correct. Question Hour and supplementary questions are crucial tools of parliamentary oversight. They allow MPs to question ministers on various government policies and actions.  Supplementary questions allow for in-depth scrutiny, enabling MPs to hold the executive accountable.  These mechanisms are vital for maintaining transparency and accountability within the government.


**5. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill can only be introduced by a nominated Member of Parliament.
2.  A private member's bill has never been passed in the history of the Indian Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A private member's bill can be introduced by any Member of Parliament (MP), whether elected or nominated.  The distinction lies in the fact that they are not introduced by a minister on behalf of the government.  Private members' bills often address niche or specialized issues that may not be prioritized by the government's legislative agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While private member's bills have a low success rate due to time constraints and government priorities, some have been passed into law throughout the history of the Indian Parliament.  These successful bills often have the support of a significant number of MPs across party lines.  The success of a private member's bill often depends on its merits and the level of political support it gains.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the parliamentary form of government:**

1. The executive and legislature function entirely independently in a parliamentary system.
2. A key advantage of the parliamentary system is the executive's responsibility to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A defining feature of a parliamentary system is the close relationship between the executive and the legislature. The executive branch (the government) is drawn from and accountable to the legislature (Parliament). Ministers are members of Parliament and must maintain the confidence of the legislature to remain in power.  This interconnectedness is designed to ensure that the executive acts in accordance with the will of the elected representatives.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major strength of the parliamentary system is the executive's accountability to the legislature.  The legislature can hold the executive responsible for its actions through mechanisms like questions, debates, no-confidence motions, and other parliamentary procedures. This accountability promotes good governance and prevents the executive from acting arbitrarily.


**7. With reference to the Cabinet form of government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet system serves primarily to minimize criticism of the government.
2.  The Cabinet system is a mechanism to ensure the collective responsibility of the government to the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cabinet system may indirectly reduce criticism by presenting a united front, its primary purpose is not to minimize criticism.  The Cabinet’s collective decision-making and responsibility promote a more cohesive and effective approach to governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core principle of the Cabinet system is collective responsibility.  All Cabinet ministers are jointly responsible for government policies and actions.  This means that they must support the decisions of the Cabinet, even if they disagree with some aspects of them. This collective responsibility ensures that the government acts as a unified entity, accountable to the legislature and the people.


**8. Consider the following statements about judicial review in India:**

1. Judicial review in India allows the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws passed by the legislature.
2.  Judicial review enables the judiciary to pronounce on the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India primarily focuses on the constitutionality of laws, not on their wisdom or effectiveness. The judiciary does not have the power to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature on matters of policy or expediency. The courts may review laws to ensure they conform to the constitution but not to assess whether they are wise or good policy.


Statement 2 is correct.  Judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the Indian judicial system.  It empowers the judiciary to determine whether laws enacted by the legislature or executive orders issued by the government are consistent with the provisions of the Constitution. This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights. The Supreme Court plays a pivotal role in this process, acting as the final arbiter of constitutional disputes.



**9. With reference to the concept of equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1. Equality necessitates the absence of competition.
2.  Equality implies the absence of privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Equality does not eliminate competition. A fair and just society can and should have competition, provided the playing field is level.  Equality aims to ensure that all individuals have equal opportunities, regardless of their background or circumstances.  Competition, when fair, can drive progress and innovation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Equality is fundamentally incompatible with privileges.  Privileges grant certain individuals or groups advantages that are not available to others, thereby undermining the principle of equal treatment.  A truly equal society strives to eliminate such privileges, ensuring that everyone has an equal chance to succeed based on their merits and efforts.  The concept of equality demands a level playing field, where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunities.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Government of India Act, 1935:**

1. The Act assigned residuary powers to the Federal Legislature.
2. The Act established a unitary form of government in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, vested residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to the federal or provincial legislatures) with the Governor-General. This was a significant departure from earlier acts, which had more clearly defined divisions of power.  The Act attempted to establish a more centralized system within a federal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a federal structure of government in India, though with a strong centralizing tendency. It divided powers between a federal government and provincial governments, though the federal government retained significant control over several key areas. The Act was a complex piece of legislation that aimed to balance federal and unitary principles.  It aimed to create a quasi-federal structure, with the central government having more power than the provinces.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar:**

1.  Aadhaar can be used as definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number can never be deactivated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a biometric identification system, not a proof of citizenship or domicile. While it can be used as a supporting document, it does not, on its own, establish citizenship or domicile.  Other documents are required to establish these aspects, and Aadhaar's role is limited to verifying identity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar numbers are intended to be permanent, they are not immutable.  Under certain circumstances (such as detection of fraudulent registration or requests from the individual), Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated or corrected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).  The UIDAI has mechanisms in place to address errors or concerns related to Aadhaar data.


**12. With reference to the Right to Privacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court has upheld the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  However, through judicial interpretation, it has been recognized as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the landmark *Puttaswamy* judgment (2017), the Supreme Court of India explicitly recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, inherent in Article 21 of the Constitution. This decision significantly broadened the scope of fundamental rights in India and has implications for various aspects of governance and public policy.  The court asserted that the right to privacy is an essential component of the right to life and personal liberty, protecting an individual's autonomy and dignity.



**13. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The value of each MLA's vote is uniform across all states.
2. The value of votes of Lok Sabha MPs is higher than that of Rajya Sabha MPs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The value of each MLA's vote in the presidential election is not uniform across all states. It varies from state to state, based on the ratio of the state's population to the number of MLAs it has.  States with larger populations have MLAs with higher vote values. This system is designed to ensure that states with larger populations have a proportionally greater say in the presidential election.

Statement 2 is correct. The value of a vote cast by a Lok Sabha MP in the presidential election is higher than the value of a vote cast by a Rajya Sabha MP. This difference reflects the fact that the Lok Sabha is directly elected by the people and is considered more representative of the popular will.  The formula used to calculate the value of each vote ensures that Lok Sabha MPs have a greater influence on the outcome of the presidential election.



**14. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a State:**

1. Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor during his/her term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a Governor cannot be reduced during his/her term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution grants immunity to the Governor from criminal proceedings during his or her term of office. This immunity protects the Governor from being subjected to undue political pressure or harassment.  This protection is crucial for maintaining the impartiality and dignity of the Governor's office.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution explicitly states that the emoluments and allowances of the Governor cannot be diminished during his or her term. This provision safeguards the Governor's financial security and independence. This protection is designed to ensure that the Governor is not susceptible to external pressures that could compromise their impartiality or ability to perform their constitutional duties.



**15. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements about the Committee on Subordinate Legislation:**

1. This committee examines whether the executive is properly exercising delegated powers to make regulations.
2. This committee reports directly to the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation in the Indian Parliament scrutinizes the exercise of delegated legislative power by the executive.  It examines whether the executive is making regulations, rules, and bylaws within the limits of the powers delegated to it by the Parliament or the Constitution.  This oversight function is critical for preventing the executive from overstepping its authority and ensuring that delegated legislation is in line with the intent of the primary legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation reports its findings to the House (either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha) that appointed it, not to the President. The President is the head of state, but the committee's function is primarily related to parliamentary oversight, reporting its conclusions to the relevant House of Parliament for action.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly:**

1. The Speaker vacates office if he/she ceases to be a member of the Assembly.
2.  The Speaker automatically vacates office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  If the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly ceases to be a member of the Assembly (e.g., through resignation, disqualification, or death), he or she automatically vacates the Speaker's office. This is a fundamental constitutional requirement, ensuring that the Speaker always retains the necessary qualifications for the office.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Speaker does not automatically vacate his/her office upon the dissolution of the Assembly. Although the Assembly is dissolved, the Speaker continues in office until the new Assembly is constituted. This is to ensure continuity of office and to facilitate the smooth functioning of the legislative process after the dissolution of the Assembly. The Speaker's position is distinct from the membership of the Assembly.


**17. With reference to Article 356 of the Indian Constitution (President's Rule), consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Assembly.
2.  The President's rule empowers the Parliament to exercise the powers of the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 does not automatically dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. The President has the discretion to dissolve the Assembly or to allow it to continue, depending on the circumstances.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly is a political one, taken by the President in consultation with the government.

Statement 2 is correct. When President's rule is imposed on a state, the Parliament can make laws for that state. This is a crucial provision that allows the central government to maintain order and governance in the state during the period of President's rule. This power is intended to be temporary and is subject to parliamentary oversight.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. Parliament can add any law to the Ninth Schedule.
2. Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution through a simple amendment process. This power was intended to protect certain land reforms and other legislations from judicial scrutiny.  However, the Supreme Court has, in some cases, reviewed laws even if they are listed in the Ninth Schedule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws included in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, this is no longer the case. The Supreme Court has held that even laws in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution. This interpretation has restricted the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection and has affirmed the judiciary's role in upholding the Constitution's basic structure.


**19. Consider the following statements about the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Swatantra Party was the largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.
2. The post of Leader of the Opposition was first recognized in 1969.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Swatantra Party was the single largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.  This reflected the political landscape of the time, with a diverse range of political forces competing for influence.  The party's prominence highlighted the early stages of India's multi-party system.

Statement 2 is correct. The formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was established in 1969.  Before that, while the largest opposition party played a significant role, the position of Leader of the Opposition did not have official recognition.  The establishment of the position formalized the role of the opposition in the parliamentary system.


**20. With reference to the relationship between law and liberty, consider the following statements:**

1. More laws necessarily imply less liberty.
2. The absence of laws implies the absence of liberty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between law and liberty is not a simple inverse correlation.  While excessive or unjust laws can restrict liberty, well-crafted laws are essential for protecting individual freedoms and ensuring social order.  Laws that protect fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech or assembly, actually enhance liberty.  The quality and nature of laws are more important than their mere number.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The absence of laws does not equate to liberty.  Without laws and a system of justice, there is anarchy, and individual liberties are often threatened.  A just legal framework is necessary to protect individuals from arbitrary power and ensure the peaceful coexistence of different groups.  Law is a tool that can be used to both protect and restrict liberty, depending on its nature and enforcement.


**21.  Consider the following statements regarding the "Rule of Law":**

1. The Rule of Law necessitates the limitation of governmental powers.
2. The Rule of Law implies the people's responsibility to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of the Rule of Law is that governmental power is limited and subject to legal constraints.  This prevents arbitrary exercise of power and protects individual rights.  The Rule of Law ensures that government actions are subject to legal scrutiny and that no one, including those in power, is above the law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rule of Law primarily emphasizes the government's responsibility to the people, not vice versa. While citizens have responsibilities to uphold the law, the core of the Rule of Law is the accountability of the government to the laws it is bound by.  The Rule of Law is designed to limit the power of the state and protect the rights of individuals.  It focuses on the government's obligation to respect and uphold the law.


**22. With reference to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTE Act mandates that teacher eligibility in a state is determined solely by the concerned State Council of Teacher Education.
2.  The RTE Act requires a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) for teaching primary classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the State Councils of Teacher Education play a role in defining teacher qualifications, the RTE Act does not make their determination the sole criterion for teacher eligibility. The Act sets minimum qualifications for teachers, but states have some flexibility in defining specific requirements.  The Act aims to ensure a certain standard of teacher qualifications across the nation, but it doesn't mandate a single body to set eligibility criteria nationwide.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTE Act mandates a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) for candidates seeking to teach primary classes. This test is intended to ensure a minimum standard of competency among primary school teachers and to improve the quality of primary education. The TET is a crucial component of the Act's effort to improve the quality of education in India.


**23. Consider the following statements comparing the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):**

1. The NGT was established through legislation, while the CPCB was created by an executive order.
2. The NGT primarily focuses on environmental justice, while the CPCB's main role is to promote environmental cleanliness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established through an Act of Parliament (the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010), giving it statutory backing.  In contrast, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was created by an executive order of the government. This difference in establishment reflects the NGT's higher legal standing and its greater authority in adjudicating environmental matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  While both the NGT and CPCB aim to protect the environment, their functions differ. The NGT is a specialized tribunal for adjudicating environmental disputes, acting as a specialized court to provide environmental justice. The CPCB, on the other hand, is a regulatory body that monitors pollution levels, sets standards, and advises the government on environmental matters.  The NGT's focus is on resolving disputes, whereas the CPCB's focus is on regulation and monitoring.


**24. With reference to Money Bills in India, consider the following statement:**

1. A bill containing only provisions related to taxation is automatically a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A bill is deemed a Money Bill if it solely deals with matters relating to taxation, borrowing, or the Consolidated Fund of India. This definition is crucial for determining the legislative process and powers of the two houses of Parliament.  A bill that strictly adheres to this definition is automatically classified as a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha (Lower House) can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key element of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting its greater representation of the people's will.  The Rajya Sabha can delay a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days but cannot reject it.


**25. Consider the following statements about the Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC):**

1.  MPCs are constitutional bodies.
2.  MPCs are solely responsible for implementing government-sponsored schemes in metropolitan areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Metropolitan Planning Committees (MPCs) are not constitutional bodies. They are statutory bodies established under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, dealing with urban local governance.  While they are important for urban planning, their establishment is through legislation, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MPCs are not solely responsible for implementing government schemes in metropolitan areas. They prepare development plans for metropolitan areas, but the implementation of government schemes is carried out by various government agencies and departments. The MPC’s role is primarily planning and coordination, not direct implementation.  Various other government bodies are involved in implementation.  The MPC provides a framework but does not have sole implementation authority.


**26. With reference to "vote-on-account" and "interim budget," consider the following statements:**

1. A vote-on-account is used by a regular government, while an interim budget is used by a caretaker government.
2. A vote-on-account only deals with expenditure, while an interim budget includes both expenditure and receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A vote-on-account is a mechanism used by a regular government to meet its immediate financial needs when a full budget is not yet ready. An interim budget, on the other hand, is typically presented by a caretaker government (one that's in power but awaiting elections) to cover essential expenditures until a new government is formed and presents a new budget.  The distinction lies in the circumstances under which they are used.

Statement 2 is correct. A vote-on-account only deals with government expenditure, providing for essential services and operations for a limited period. An interim budget, however, is more comprehensive, including provisions for both expenditure and receipts, covering the government's financial needs until a full budget can be passed.  The interim budget provides a more complete financial picture for the limited period.


**27. Consider the following statements about the distribution of powers between the Centre and States in India:**

1. The scheme for this distribution is based on the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909.
2. The scheme for this distribution is based on the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 introduced some elements of decentralization but did not establish the framework for the distribution of powers between the Centre and States as we see it today.  These reforms were a step towards greater Indian participation in governance but did not create the foundational structure for federalism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, laid the foundation for the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India. While the Constitution of India significantly modified this framework, the basic structure of a federal system with divided powers was established by the 1935 Act.  The Act created a system of federal government in India, setting the stage for the current system's development.


**28. With reference to the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Sabhas have the power to prevent land alienation in Scheduled Areas.
2.  Gram Sabhas have ownership of major forest produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PESA Act empowers Gram Sabhas to play a crucial role in preventing land alienation in Scheduled Areas.  This is aimed at protecting the land rights of tribal communities and preventing their exploitation. This provision is designed to preserve the traditional land ownership patterns and prevent encroachment on tribal lands.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Gram Sabhas do not have ownership of major forest produce.  Under the PESA Act, Gram Sabhas have the right to manage minor forest produce, but the ownership and management of major forest produce remain with the state government. This distinction is crucial in understanding the extent of Gram Sabha powers.  The management of minor forest produce is intended to empower local communities, while major forest produce remains under state control.


**29.  Consider the following statements about the purpose of an adjournment motion in the Indian Parliament:**

1. It is used to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.
2. It is a tool to postpone parliamentary proceedings indefinitely.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An adjournment motion is a parliamentary device used to interrupt the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.  It is a tool employed by the opposition to bring attention to critical issues that require immediate attention.  The motion, if admitted, leads to a debate on the issue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An adjournment motion is not intended to postpone parliamentary proceedings indefinitely. Its purpose is to allow for a discussion on an urgent matter, not to disrupt the entire parliamentary schedule.  The motion is meant to highlight urgent issues, not to halt the parliamentary process.


**30. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act is based on the right to a healthy environment, interpreted as part of Article 21.
2. The Act is based on the provisions of Article 275(1) regarding grants for Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, is fundamentally linked to the right to a healthy environment, which is considered a part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.  The Act aims to provide a swift and effective mechanism for resolving environmental disputes and ensuring environmental protection, which is crucial for a healthy life.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NGT Act is not based on Article 275(1), which deals with grants for Scheduled Areas.  While the Act may indirectly impact Scheduled Areas, its core legal basis lies in the right to a healthy environment, interpreted within the broader context of Article 21.  The Act's focus is on environmental justice and speedy resolution of environmental disputes, irrespective of geographical location.




**1. With reference to John Rawls' theory of justice, consider the following statements:**

1. Rawls argues that a just society is one where individuals, unaware of their own social standing, would choose principles that benefit even the least advantaged.
2. Rawls' concept of the "veil of ignorance" necessitates individuals to prioritize their personal interests above societal well-being when deciding on societal structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

John Rawls' theory of justice, as presented in his seminal work *A Theory of Justice*, centers on the idea of a "veil of ignorance."  This hypothetical scenario proposes that individuals making decisions about the structure of society should be unaware of their own future social position, class, talents, and even their conception of the good life.  This lack of self-knowledge forces them to consider the principles of justice impartially, ensuring fairness for all members of society, including the least advantaged.  Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects a core tenet of Rawls' theory.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The "veil of ignorance" does *not* encourage prioritizing personal interests.  Instead, it compels individuals to adopt a perspective that safeguards the interests of the least fortunate, as they could potentially occupy that position themselves.  By removing self-interest from the equation, Rawls aims to establish a fair and just basis for societal organization. The emphasis is on creating a society where everyone has a reasonable chance at a good life, regardless of their initial circumstances.  This aligns with Rawls' concept of justice as fairness.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding principles of justice:**

1. The principle of "treating equals equally" implies that individuals with similar characteristics should receive the same treatment and rewards, regardless of their social background.
2. The principle of proportionality suggests that rewards and duties should be distributed based solely on individual merit and achievement, without considering social needs or circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The principle of "treating equals equally" is a fundamental concept in justice. It posits that individuals who are similar in relevant respects should be treated similarly. This principle is crucial for preventing discrimination and ensuring fairness.  However,  "equal treatment" needs careful consideration of what constitutes "relevant respects".  Simply applying the same rules to everyone irrespective of their individual circumstances might not be just. Statement 1 correctly captures the essence of this principle, emphasizing equal treatment for those with similar attributes.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While merit and achievement are important factors in determining just distribution, the principle of proportionality does *not* exclude considerations of social needs and circumstances.  A just society might need to incorporate affirmative action or other measures to address historical inequalities or existing disadvantages.  A purely meritocratic approach, as suggested in statement 2, could exacerbate existing inequalities and fail to create a truly just society.  Proportionality advocates for a balanced approach, taking into account both merit and the need for social equity.


**3. With reference to the concept of social justice, consider the following statements:**

1. Social justice solely focuses on ensuring that laws and policies treat individuals fairly, without concerning itself with the distribution of resources or opportunities.
2. Achieving social justice requires addressing economic and social inequalities through resource redistribution and the creation of a level playing field for all citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Social justice is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond merely fair legal treatment.  While ensuring fairness in laws and policies is crucial, social justice also demands a just distribution of resources and opportunities.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect; social justice actively engages with the equitable distribution of societal goods, including wealth, income, healthcare, education, and other essential resources. Statement 2 correctly highlights this aspect of social justice. It acknowledges the need to address economic and social disparities to create a level playing field.  This may involve redistributive policies, affirmative action, and other measures aimed at reducing inequality and providing equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their social background or economic status.  A truly just society cannot afford to ignore the stark realities of economic and social disparities; social justice necessitates active intervention to address these inequalities and promote a more equitable society.


**4. With reference to the different principles of justice, consider the following statements:**

1. Pursuing equality of treatment might sometimes conflict with rewarding merit, potentially disadvantaging marginalized groups who lack equal access to resources.
2. Emphasizing merit as the sole principle of justice ensures that all members of society have a fair and equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The pursuit of justice often involves navigating competing principles. Statement 1 correctly identifies a potential conflict between equality of treatment and rewarding merit.  A strict adherence to equal treatment for all might overlook the fact that some individuals start from significantly disadvantaged positions due to factors like poverty, lack of access to education, or historical discrimination.  Rewarding merit alone in such a context could exacerbate existing inequalities rather than promote justice.  Therefore, a just society needs mechanisms to balance these competing principles, ensuring that while merit is acknowledged, it does not come at the expense of addressing systemic inequalities and providing opportunities for those who have been historically marginalized. Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  Emphasizing merit as the *sole* principle of justice ignores the realities of social inequality and the impact of social structures on individuals' opportunities.  A purely meritocratic system can perpetuate and even worsen existing inequalities, failing to create a just society for all.  A just society necessitates a more nuanced approach that considers both merit and the need to address historical and ongoing inequalities.


**5. With reference to the concept of human rights, consider the following statements:**

1. Human rights derive their legitimacy solely from their adoption and recognition by states, and they are not inherently linked to moral principles.
2. The expansion and reinterpretation of human rights have continually included previously excluded groups and reflected evolving understandings of human dignity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The concept of human rights is deeply rooted in moral principles concerning inherent human dignity and worth. While state recognition and legal enforcement are crucial for the practical realization of human rights, their fundamental basis lies in moral philosophy and ethical considerations.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect; human rights are not solely dependent on state action for their legitimacy. Their moral foundation precedes and underpins their legal codification. Statement 2 accurately captures the dynamic nature of human rights. Throughout history, the understanding of human rights has evolved, and the scope of rights has expanded to encompass previously excluded groups, reflecting our growing awareness of various forms of injustice and discrimination. This continual evolution demonstrates the adaptive and progressive nature of human rights discourse, constantly striving to achieve greater inclusivity and fairness.  The struggle for human rights is a continuous process of expanding their scope and ensuring their application to all individuals, irrespective of their background or circumstances.


**6. Consider the following statements about political theory:**

1. Political theory primarily focuses on explaining the relationship between different religions and their influence on political systems.
2. It analyzes fundamental political concepts like freedom and equality, clarifying their meanings and exploring their significance in various contexts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Political theory is a branch of political science that delves into the fundamental principles, concepts, and values that underpin political systems and social life. While political theory might touch upon the interplay between religion and politics in specific instances, its primary focus is not on comparing or explaining the relationships between different religions.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Political theory's core concern is analyzing the fundamental concepts and principles that shape political life, including concepts like freedom, equality, justice, power, and authority. It explores the various interpretations and applications of these concepts across different historical periods and political systems.   Statement 2 accurately reflects this core function of political theory. It emphasizes the clarification of concepts and their relevance in understanding political phenomena and shaping political action.  Political theory provides the conceptual framework for analyzing political events, policies, and institutions, contributing to a deeper understanding of the political world.


**7. With reference to the concept of globalization, consider the following statements:**

1. Globalization primarily involves the conduct of external relations between two or more states of the world, focusing on inter-state diplomacy and agreements.
2. Globalization encompasses a process of interconnectedness of worldwide social relations, transcending geographical boundaries and fostering global interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Globalization is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that extends far beyond the realm of inter-state relations. While international diplomacy and state interactions play a role in globalization, it is not limited to these aspects.  Statement 1 is therefore an oversimplification of globalization. It fails to capture the broader dimensions of interconnectedness and interdependence that characterize the process. Statement 2 provides a more comprehensive and accurate account of globalization. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of worldwide social relations, encompassing economic, cultural, technological, and political interactions that transcend national borders.  Globalization involves the flow of goods, services, capital, information, and people across geographical boundaries, leading to increased interdependence and integration among different parts of the world. This interconnectedness fosters global interaction and exchange, shaping various aspects of our lives in profound ways.


**8. With reference to political legitimacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Consent of the governed is a crucial source of political legitimacy, ensuring that the authority of the government rests upon the will of the people.
2. Political will of the ruler, irrespective of popular consent, is sufficient to establish and maintain political legitimacy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Political legitimacy refers to the acceptance and justification of political authority.  While various factors contribute to political legitimacy, the consent of the governed is widely considered a fundamental element.  A government that enjoys the support and acceptance of the people is more likely to be viewed as legitimate.  Statement 1 correctly identifies this crucial source of legitimacy, emphasizing the importance of popular consent in establishing and maintaining political authority.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  Political legitimacy cannot be solely based on the ruler's will.  A government that lacks popular consent, even if it possesses the power to enforce its authority, is unlikely to be regarded as fully legitimate in a democratic context.  Legitimacy requires a degree of acceptance and endorsement from the governed.  Rulers need to demonstrate that their actions are consistent with the values and interests of the people they govern in order to be seen as legitimate.


**9.  Consider the following statements about political culture:**

1. Parochial political culture is typically characterized by high levels of political participation and engagement among citizens.
2. Parochial political culture is often associated with limited political awareness and engagement, with individuals primarily focused on their local communities and personal affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Political culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, attitudes, and norms that shape political behavior within a society.  Parochial political culture represents one type of political culture, characterized by low levels of political awareness and participation.  Individuals in societies with parochial political cultures tend to be less involved in national or broader political issues, focusing primarily on their immediate local communities and personal concerns.  Statement 2 accurately describes this characteristic of parochial political culture.  Statement 1 is incorrect; parochial political culture is not associated with high levels of political participation. Rather, it is characterized by a lack of engagement with broader political processes and institutions.  Citizens in societies with parochial political cultures may have limited knowledge of national-level politics and show less interest in participating in national-level political activities.  This contrasts with other types of political cultures, such as subject or participant political cultures, where individuals are more engaged in national politics.


**10. With reference to social equality, consider the following statements:**

1. Social equality implies that each person should perform societal functions according to their assigned social status, maintaining the existing social hierarchy.
2. Social equality signifies that no person should face relative inferiority due to factors like caste, race, or religion, ensuring equal opportunities and treatment for all.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Social equality is a fundamental concept that emphasizes the equal worth and dignity of all individuals, irrespective of their social background or group affiliation.  It stands in contrast to social hierarchies and systems of discrimination.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect; social equality does not advocate for maintaining the existing social hierarchy or assigning roles based on pre-determined social status. Instead, it challenges such systems of inequality. Statement 2 accurately captures the essence of social equality. It highlights the principle of equal opportunity and treatment for all, regardless of factors like caste, race, or religion.  Social equality aims to create a society where everyone has the chance to reach their full potential, free from the constraints of discrimination or prejudice.  It promotes the dismantling of social hierarchies and the creation of a more just and equitable society.  This includes not only equal legal rights but also equal access to resources, opportunities, and social participation.


**11. With reference to the concept of development, consider the following statements:**

1. Development solely focuses on economic growth and material progress, without considering social, environmental, or political factors.
2. Development is a multi-faceted concept encompassing economic, social, environmental, and political dimensions, aiming for a better life and increased freedoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The concept of development has evolved significantly over time, moving beyond a narrow focus on economic growth to encompass a broader understanding of human well-being.  Statement 1 is therefore an outdated and incomplete view of development.  Development is not merely about increasing a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or accumulating material wealth.  While economic growth is an important aspect, it must be considered within a broader context that includes social, environmental, and political factors.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this expanded understanding of development. It emphasizes the multi-dimensional nature of development, acknowledging the interconnectedness of economic, social, environmental, and political progress.  Development aims to improve the quality of life for all members of society, promoting human well-being and expanding freedoms.  This includes not only economic prosperity but also social justice, environmental sustainability, and good governance.  A holistic approach to development is essential for ensuring sustainable and equitable progress.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the state in ensuring rights:**

1. The state's role in protecting rights is limited to enacting laws and policies; it is not responsible for actively ensuring the fulfillment of these rights.
2. The state has both positive and negative obligations regarding rights; it must not only refrain from violating rights but also take proactive steps to ensure their fulfillment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The state plays a crucial role in protecting and promoting human rights.  However, its role is not merely passive.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect; the state's responsibility extends beyond simply enacting laws.  It has a positive obligation to actively ensure the fulfillment of rights, taking proactive measures to create conditions conducive to the enjoyment of these rights by all citizens. This includes providing necessary resources, infrastructure, and support to enable citizens to exercise their rights effectively.  Statement 2 correctly emphasizes this dual obligation of the state.  It highlights that the state must not only refrain from violating rights (negative obligation) but also actively work to ensure their realization (positive obligation).  This includes addressing systemic inequalities, providing essential services, and protecting vulnerable groups from human rights abuses.  The state's active role in promoting and protecting human rights is essential for creating a just and equitable society.


**13. With reference to the concept of freedom, consider the following statements:**

1. Societal rules and regulations always curtail individual freedom, as any constraint on individual actions is a limitation of freedom.
2. Some constraints on individual freedom are necessary for social living; such constraints can also enhance freedom by providing security and conditions for self-development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The concept of freedom is complex and multifaceted, and its relationship with societal rules and regulations is not straightforward.  Statement 1 is therefore an oversimplification.  While rules and regulations do impose constraints on individual actions, they are not always detrimental to freedom.  In fact, some constraints are essential for maintaining social order and ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals.  Statement 2 correctly acknowledges this nuanced relationship between freedom and constraint.  It emphasizes that some limitations on individual freedom are necessary for creating a secure and stable social environment.  These constraints can, paradoxically, enhance freedom by providing the conditions for self-development and the pursuit of individual goals.  For instance, laws against theft and violence create a secure environment where individuals can pursue their lives and aspirations without fear of harm.  Therefore, the relationship between freedom and constraint is not simply one of opposition but rather a complex interplay that requires careful consideration.


**14. With reference to political participation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Full and meaningful political participation is possible even when basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare are not met.
2. Political rights are most valuable when basic needs are met, as individuals struggling for survival may not have the capacity to actively engage in political processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Meaningful political participation requires more than just formal rights; it also necessitates the capacity and resources to exercise those rights effectively.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Individuals struggling to meet their basic needs—food, shelter, healthcare—are likely to have limited capacity to engage actively in political processes.  Their primary concerns will revolve around survival rather than political participation.  Statement 2 correctly captures this relationship between basic needs and political participation.  It emphasizes that political rights are most meaningful and effective when basic needs are met, allowing individuals to focus their energy and attention on political issues and participate fully in shaping their society.  Addressing basic needs is a prerequisite for ensuring meaningful political participation and promoting a truly democratic society.  Without addressing fundamental needs, political rights become largely symbolic, failing to empower individuals to shape their political destiny.



**1. With reference to the recommendations of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commission recommended extending the scope of the prohibition against discrimination (under Articles 15 and 16) to include ‘ethnic or social origin, political or other opinion, property or birth.’
2.  The Commission proposed adding a new Fundamental Right guaranteeing access to courts and tribunals and ensuring speedy justice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC), chaired by Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, submitted its report in 2002.  The Commission extensively reviewed various aspects of the Indian Constitution and proposed several amendments and reforms.  Regarding Fundamental Rights, the NCRWC indeed suggested broadening the ambit of Articles 15 and 16 to encompass discrimination based on "ethnic or social origin, political or other opinion, property or birth." This recommendation aimed to address evolving societal inequalities and ensure comprehensive protection against discrimination.  Furthermore, the Commission explicitly advocated for the inclusion of a new Fundamental Right guaranteeing "Right to access to courts and tribunals and speedy justice." This was intended to strengthen the judicial system's accessibility and efficiency, ensuring that citizens could effectively exercise their legal rights without undue delays or costs.  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect as they present only one aspect of the Commission's recommendations. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the Commission's proposals. The NCRWC's recommendations, while not all implemented, signify a crucial effort to adapt the Constitution to contemporary challenges and societal needs.


**2. With reference to the recommendations regarding Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission proposed making the existing Fundamental Duties legally enforceable through appropriate mechanisms.
2.  The Commission suggested the inclusion of a new Fundamental Duty mandating active participation in the democratic process of governance and tax payment.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCRWC’s report addressed the efficacy of Fundamental Duties, which, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not judicially enforceable. While the Commission didn't propose making *all* existing Fundamental Duties legally binding (which would be a significant constitutional shift), it did emphasize the need for mechanisms to enhance their effectiveness and popularize them. However,  the primary focus was on strengthening their impact through social and educational initiatives rather than direct legal enforcement.  Therefore, statement 1 is not entirely accurate in its representation of the NCRWC's recommendations.  On the other hand, the Commission did specifically recommend adding a new Fundamental Duty that explicitly included the obligation to "actively participate in the democratic process of governance and to pay taxes." This aimed at fostering a sense of civic responsibility and participation in the democratic system. Statement 2 accurately reflects this particular proposal. Consequently, only statement 2 correctly represents a key recommendation from the NCRWC report regarding Fundamental Duties.


**3. With reference to the proposed changes to the Right to Property, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission recommended amending Article 300-A to explicitly state that the deprivation or acquisition of property should be for a public purpose and not arbitrary.
2.  The Commission proposed a ‘right to suitable rehabilitation’ for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes whose land is acquired.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRWC's recommendations concerning the Right to Property focused on strengthening the existing safeguards and addressing the concerns of marginalized communities.  The Commission proposed a significant recasting of Article 300-A, clarifying that any deprivation or acquisition of property must be authorized by law, solely for a public purpose, and must not be arbitrary. This aimed at preventing misuse of the power of acquisition and ensuring fairness and transparency in the process.  Furthermore, the Commission explicitly advocated for the inclusion of a 'right to suitable rehabilitation' for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in cases of land acquisition.  This critical addition aimed to mitigate the disproportionate impact of land acquisition on these vulnerable groups, ensuring they receive adequate compensation and resettlement support.  Both statements accurately reflect the Commission's proposed changes to the Right to Property, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the comprehensive nature of the Commission's recommendations on this issue.


**4. With reference to the proposed amendments to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission recommended adding a new Directive Principle focused on population control.
2. The Commission proposed the establishment of an independent National Education Commission to be constituted every five years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRWC recognized the importance of Directive Principles in guiding social and economic policy.  The Commission proposed several amendments to enhance their relevance and effectiveness.  One significant suggestion was the inclusion of a new Directive Principle specifically addressing population control. This reflected the growing concern about population growth and its implications for resource management and sustainable development.  The Commission also recommended establishing an independent National Education Commission, to be reconstituted every five years. This aimed at ensuring continuous review and reform of the education system, promoting its quality and relevance to national needs.  Both statements correctly reflect the NCRWC's proposals concerning Directive Principles.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they only partially represent the Commission's recommendations. The Commission's suggestions underline the need for regular evaluation and updating of national policies to address evolving societal challenges.


**5. With reference to the proposed changes concerning Parliament and State Legislatures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission recommended defining and limiting the privileges of legislators to ensure the free and independent functioning of Parliament and State Legislatures.
2.  The Commission suggested that the MP Local Area Development Scheme should be discontinued.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRWC addressed several aspects of the functioning of Parliament and State Legislatures, focusing on enhancing transparency and accountability.  The Commission proposed clearly defining and limiting the privileges of legislators. This was intended to prevent the misuse of privileges, safeguarding the independence of the legislature and ensuring its effective functioning.  Unfettered privileges could potentially impede scrutiny and accountability, hindering the democratic process.  Moreover, the Commission recommended discontinuing the MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme.  This recommendation stemmed from concerns about potential misuse of funds and lack of transparency in the allocation and utilization of resources. The Commission believed that the scheme could lead to favoritism and undermine the principles of equitable development. Both statements accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations concerning Parliament and State Legislatures, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for both the recommendations.


**6. With reference to the proposed reforms in the Executive and Administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission suggested that in case of a hung Parliament, the Lok Sabha should elect the leader of the House, who would then be appointed Prime Minister by the President.
2.  The Commission recommended a system of 'constructive vote of no-confidence', requiring a motion of no-confidence to include a proposal for an alternative leader.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRWC's recommendations on executive and administrative reforms focused on enhancing governmental stability and efficiency.  Regarding hung Parliaments, the Commission proposed a mechanism where the Lok Sabha would elect the leader of the House, who would subsequently be appointed Prime Minister by the President. This aimed to provide a clear and constitutionally sound process for forming a government in such situations, preventing prolonged political instability.  Additionally, the Commission recommended introducing a system of 'constructive vote of no-confidence'.  This would require any motion of no-confidence to include a simultaneous proposal for an alternative leader.  This approach aimed at ensuring governmental stability by preventing situations where a government is brought down without a clear alternative in place.  Both statements accurately reflect the NCRWC's proposals for reforming the executive and administrative aspects of governance, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incompletely represent the Commission's recommendations.


**7. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is mandated to investigate matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Castes and report to the President.
2.  The Constitution empowers the President to appoint a National Commission for Scheduled Castes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body established to protect and promote the interests of Scheduled Castes in India.  Its functions, as defined by the Constitution, include investigating all matters related to the constitutional safeguards provided to Scheduled Castes and submitting reports to the President of India.  The President is constitutionally empowered to appoint the Chairperson and members of the NCSC.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the NCSC's mandate and constitutional basis.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize that both statements are correct reflections of the NCSC's constitutional role and the President's authority concerning its establishment. The NCSC plays a vital role in ensuring the effective implementation of constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Castes.


**8. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCST has the power to investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Tribes and report to the Parliament.
2. The Constitution mandates the President to establish a separate National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) is a constitutional body established to protect and promote the interests of Scheduled Tribes. While the NCST investigates matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Tribes, its reports are submitted to the President, not directly to the Parliament.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does mandate the President to establish a separate NCST, distinct from the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.  This reflects the constitutional recognition of the unique needs and challenges faced by Scheduled Tribes.  Statement 2 is correct. As a result, only statement 2 accurately describes the constitutional provisions regarding the NCST.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. The NCST plays a crucial role in safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Tribes.


**9. With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCBC is a constitutional body established to investigate matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes.
2. The President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCBC.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) is a constitutional body established to protect and promote the interests of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs).  The NCBC is mandated to investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards provided to SEBCs and submit reports to the President.  The President of India appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCBC.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the NCBC's constitutional role and the President's authority in its establishment. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize that both statements correctly describe the NCBC's constitutional position and the President's role in its formation.  The NCBC plays a crucial role in ensuring the effective implementation of constitutional safeguards for SEBCs.


**10. With reference to the provisions for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union government can issue directions to state governments regarding schemes for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.
2.  The Constitution mandates the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of Scheduled Tribes every ten years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution contains provisions for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes. The Union government's power to issue directives to state governments on Scheduled Tribe welfare schemes is a crucial aspect of this. This reflects the Union's role in ensuring the consistent implementation of welfare measures across states. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, while the Constitution allows for the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of Scheduled Tribes, it doesn't mandate such appointments at fixed intervals of ten years.  The appointments have happened at various points in time, driven by specific needs and concerns.  Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  Consequently, only statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions related to Scheduled Tribe welfare. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the constitutional power of the Union government concerning the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  The Union's directive power is essential for ensuring uniformity and effectiveness in welfare programs across states.


**11. With reference to the provisions for the welfare of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs), consider the following statements:**

1. The President can appoint a commission to investigate the conditions of SEBCs and recommend steps for their improvement.
2. The Constitution defines the criteria for determining which classes are considered SEBCs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India provides for the welfare of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs).  The President has the power to appoint commissions to investigate their conditions and recommend measures for their upliftment.  This is a key mechanism for addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by SEBCs. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. However, the Constitution does not define the precise criteria for determining which classes fall under the SEBC category.  This has been a subject of much debate and legal interpretation, with various commissions and government policies attempting to define these criteria.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Consequently, only statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions related to SEBC welfare. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the President's power to appoint commissions for SEBC welfare and the lack of a precise constitutional definition of SEBCs.  The flexibility in defining SEBCs allows for adaptation to changing societal circumstances.


**12.  With reference to the National Education Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended the establishment of a National Education Commission to be constituted every five years.
2. The Constitution mandates the establishment of a National Education Commission.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) recommended the establishment of a National Education Commission to be constituted every five years. This was a key recommendation to ensure continuous review and improvement of India's education system.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Constitution of India does not, however, mandate the establishment of a National Education Commission. While the Constitution promotes education through various provisions, it does not create a specific body with that name and mandate.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 correctly reflects the NCRWC's recommendation. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendation and the constitutional provisions regarding education. The NCRWC's recommendation highlights the importance of continuous evaluation and adaptation of the education system to meet evolving national needs.


**13. With reference to the Inter-Faith Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended the establishment of an Inter-Faith Commission to promote inter-religious harmony.
2. The Constitution mandates the establishment of an Inter-Faith Commission.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) recommended the establishment of an Inter-Faith Commission to promote inter-religious harmony and social solidarity.  This was a key recommendation aimed at fostering peaceful coexistence and understanding among diverse religious communities in India.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution of India does not, however, mandate the establishment of an Inter-Faith Commission.  While the Constitution promotes secularism and religious freedom, it does not create a specific body with that name and mandate.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendation. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendation and the constitutional provisions regarding religious harmony. The NCRWC's recommendation highlights the importance of proactive measures to promote communal harmony in a diverse society.


**14. With reference to the recommendations on  preventive detention, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended reducing the maximum period of preventive detention to six months.
2. The Commission proposed that the advisory board for preventive detention should comprise serving High Court judges.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) addressed concerns related to preventive detention, a provision that allows detention without trial under specific circumstances. The NCRWC recommended reducing the maximum period of preventive detention to six months, aiming to limit the duration of such detention and safeguard individual liberties. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Commission also proposed that the advisory board reviewing preventive detention cases should consist of serving High Court judges. This aimed to enhance the independence and impartiality of the review process, ensuring greater protection for individuals' rights.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Both statements accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations on preventive detention, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they only partially or incorrectly represent the Commission's recommendations.  The NCRWC's recommendations underscore the need for safeguards against potential abuses of power in preventive detention.


**15. With reference to the recommendations on the right to education, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended extending free and compulsory education until the age of 18 for girls and members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
2. The Commission proposed that the right to education should be explicitly included as a fundamental right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) made significant recommendations regarding the Right to Education (RTE).  The Commission suggested extending free and compulsory education to the age of 18 for girls and members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, aiming to address historical inequalities and ensure educational opportunities for these groups.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The right to education was already a part of the Constitution under Article 21A at the time of the NCRWC report; the Commission therefore did not propose adding it as a fundamental right.  While the NCRWC advocated enhancing the right to education, they didn't recommend making it a fundamental right in addition to its existing constitutional guarantee.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendations on the right to education.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations concerning the right to education.  The NCRWC's recommendations emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address inequalities in access to education.


**16. With reference to the recommendations on amending Article 25, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended treating Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism as separate religions from Hinduism.
2. The Commission proposed deleting the provisions in Article 25 that group Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism together under Hinduism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) considered the issue of religious classification within Article 25, which at the time grouped Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism under Hinduism. The NCRWC recommended treating Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism as distinct religions separate from Hinduism.  This recommendation aimed to reflect the unique identities and practices of these faiths. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  To implement this recommendation, the NCRWC also proposed deleting the existing provisions in Article 25 that grouped these religions together under Hinduism.  This was crucial to ensure that the constitutional recognition of these religions accurately reflected their distinct identities. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Both statements accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations on amending Article 25, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully represent the NCRWC's recommendations. The NCRWC's recommendations highlight the need to ensure that constitutional provisions accurately reflect the religious diversity of India.


**17.  With reference to the recommendations on Article 31B, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended restricting the protection from judicial review afforded by Article 31B to only those acts relating to agrarian reforms, reservations, and the implementation of Directive Principles.
2. The Commission proposed completely abolishing Article 31B, which protects certain laws from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 31B of the Indian Constitution provides protection from judicial review to certain laws included in the Ninth Schedule.  The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) addressed concerns about the scope of this protection. The NCRWC recommended restricting the protection from judicial review afforded by Article 31B to only those laws relating to agrarian reforms, reservations, and the implementation of Directive Principles. This aimed at limiting the scope of laws shielded from judicial scrutiny while preserving the intent behind the provision.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The NCRWC did not propose completely abolishing Article 31B.  The Commission's approach was to refine the provision rather than eliminate it entirely. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendation concerning Article 31B. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations. The NCRWC's recommendations demonstrate a balanced approach to upholding constitutional provisions while ensuring judicial oversight where necessary.


**18. With reference to the recommendations on the suspension of Fundamental Rights during emergencies, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended against the suspension of the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Articles 17, 23, 24, 25, and 32 during a national emergency.
2. The Commission suggested that the power to suspend Fundamental Rights during emergencies should be vested in the Parliament and not the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) examined the provisions related to the suspension of Fundamental Rights during national emergencies. The Commission recommended against the suspension of the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Articles 17 (Abolition of Untouchability), 23 (Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour), 24 (Prohibition of employment of children in factories, etc.), 25 (Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion), and 32 (Remedies for enforcement of Fundamental Rights) during a national emergency. This recommendation aimed to protect these fundamental rights even during emergencies. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The NCRWC did not propose shifting the power to suspend Fundamental Rights during emergencies from the President to the Parliament. The Commission focused on limiting the scope of such suspensions rather than altering the constitutional authority for this power.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendations. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations on the suspension of Fundamental Rights during emergencies. The NCRWC's recommendations highlight the importance of protecting core human rights even during exceptional circumstances.


**19. With reference to the recommendations on the National Statistical Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution recommended the implementation of recommendations contained in the Report of the National Statistical Commission (2001).

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) addressed the importance of reliable and accurate statistical data for effective governance.  The Commission recommended the implementation of recommendations contained in the Report of the National Statistical Commission (2001).  This highlighted the need to strengthen statistical capabilities and ensure the quality of data used for policy-making.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The NCRWC did not propose the establishment of a *new* National Statistical Commission.  The Commission assumed the existence of the National Statistical Commission and focused on improving its functioning and ensuring the implementation of its recommendations. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendations regarding the National Statistical Commission. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations. The NCRWC's recommendations emphasize the importance of reliable statistical data for evidence-based policymaking.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) addressed concerns about the size and efficiency of the Council of Ministers. The Commission recommended prohibiting oversized Councils of Ministers through legislation, proposing a maximum limit of 10% of the total strength of the lower house (Lok Sabha) of the legislature.  This aimed to promote efficiency and accountability within the executive branch. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The NCRWC did not propose that the President should determine the size of the Council of Ministers.  The Commission's focus was on establishing a clear legal framework to limit the size, thereby promoting efficiency and preventing potential unwieldiness. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 accurately reflects the NCRWC's recommendations on the size of the Council of Ministers. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the NCRWC's recommendations. The NCRWC's recommendations emphasize the importance of a streamlined and efficient executive for effective governance.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1.  Expenditure "charged" upon the Consolidated Fund of India requires parliamentary approval before being incurred.
2.  The Finance Commission recommends the allocation of funds to states from the Public Account of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Expenditure "charged" upon the Consolidated Fund of India does *not* require the vote of Parliament.  These are obligatory payments, such as salaries of judges and the President, which are automatically charged to the fund.  Parliament's role is limited to scrutinizing these expenditures, not approving them.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission does *not* recommend allocations from the Public Account of India. Its recommendations pertain to the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the states and the principles guiding grants-in-aid to states from the Consolidated Fund of India. The Public Account is used for various other government funds and does not fall under the Finance Commission's purview.  The Public Account holds funds that are not part of the government's revenue or expenditure, such as small savings schemes and provident fund contributions.


**2. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a complete separation of powers between the Union and State governments.
2. The Indian Constitution provides for a single citizenship, thereby limiting the federal character.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's federal system is not based on a strict separation of powers. There is a significant degree of overlap and shared responsibilities between the Union and State governments, particularly in areas listed in the Concurrent List. The Union government also has overriding powers in certain circumstances.  The system is more accurately described as a "cooperative federalism" model.

Statement 2 is correct. The existence of a single citizenship across India, as opposed to separate citizenships for each state, is a feature that diminishes the strictly federal nature of the Indian system.  This strengthens the Union's authority and creates a more unified nation.  Federal systems with dual citizenship often exhibit a greater degree of autonomy for constituent units.



**3. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's ordinance-making power is limited to situations where the Parliament is not in session.
2. An ordinance issued by the President can be withdrawn at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While it's true that ordinances are typically issued when Parliament is not in session, the President *can* issue an ordinance even when Parliament is in session. The crucial element is the existence of a situation requiring immediate action that cannot wait for the legislative process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President can withdraw an ordinance at any time.  This power is crucial for correcting errors or responding to changing circumstances.  Once withdrawn, the ordinance ceases to have legal effect.  Parliament can still legislate on the same subject matter, but the urgency that led to the ordinance is addressed by its withdrawal.



**4. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG's salary and service conditions are determined by the Parliament.
2. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of only the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's salary and service conditions are determined by the President, not the Parliament.  This ensures the CAG's independence from political influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Central and State governments.  This crucial role ensures accountability and transparency in the use of public funds at all levels.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the government.
2. The Finance Commission is constituted every five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the government. However, they carry significant weight due to their expert nature and are generally accepted and implemented by the government.  The government's acceptance is crucial for the effectiveness of the Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution mandates the constitution of a Finance Commission every five years.  This regular review of the financial relations between the Union and the States is essential for maintaining fiscal balance and equity.


**6. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced the principle of election to the legislative councils.
2. It introduced separate electorates for Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced a limited form of election to the legislative councils.  While not universal adult suffrage, it was a significant step towards greater Indian participation in the legislative process.  The introduction of elections, albeit limited, marked a shift towards a more representative system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms also introduced separate electorates for Muslims. This controversial measure aimed to address Muslim concerns about representation within the legislative councils.  However, this also contributed to the deepening of communal divisions in India.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Government of India Act, 1935:**

1. It established a federal system of government in India.
2. It introduced dyarchy at the Centre.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a federal structure, albeit an asymmetrical one, with a strong central government. It divided powers between the central and provincial governments, although the central government retained significant control. The federal structure, although imperfect, represented a significant step towards self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1935, did *not* introduce dyarchy at the Centre. Dyarchy (dual governance) was a feature of the provincial governments under the Government of India Act, 1919.  The 1935 Act aimed for a more unified and centralized executive at the central level.


**8. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are *not* justiciable. This means that courts cannot enforce them. They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies aimed at social and economic justice.  They represent the government's commitment to social and economic goals, but their enforcement relies on political will and legislative action.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by providing social and economic security to citizens.  They reflect the Constitution's commitment to a just and equitable society, promoting social justice, economic equality, and the welfare of the citizens.


**9.  With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble is a part of the Constitution and can be amended.
2. The Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble is considered a part of the Constitution and can be amended, as demonstrated by the 42nd Amendment.  It reflects the basic philosophy and objectives of the Constitution, but its wording can be modified through the amendment process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Fundamental Rights are *justiciable*.  This means they can be enforced by courts.  Citizens can approach the courts to seek redressal if their Fundamental Rights are violated.  The courts play a significant role in upholding and interpreting these rights.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The Rajya Sabha has limited powers regarding Money Bills. It cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.  It can only make recommendations for amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill, and the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations. This safeguards the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and suggest improvements, but the final decision rests with the Lok Sabha.


**11. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, though this power is rarely exercised. The President's power to dismiss a Governor is a safeguard against misuse of the office.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister. However, the appointment is typically based on the person who commands the majority in the State Legislative Assembly.  While the Governor has the formal power, the reality is that the person with majority support in the assembly is appointed Chief Minister.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the President.
2.  No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister, not the President. The President's role is primarily ceremonial in this context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.  This ensures parliamentary control over public spending and maintains the principle of financial accountability.  The appropriation bill authorizing the withdrawal of funds must be passed by Parliament.


**13. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Currently, the Election Commission of India is a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  Although the constitution allows for a multi-member commission, the current structure is a single-member commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission's responsibilities extend beyond parliamentary and state legislative elections. It also conducts elections for the President, Vice-President, and local bodies.  The Commission plays a vital role in ensuring free and fair elections at all levels.  The Commission also resolves disputes related to election matters.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates direct elections for all Panchayati Raj institutions.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for reservation of seats for women in Panchayati Raj institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act does *not* mandate direct elections for all levels of Panchayati Raj institutions. While it provides for direct elections for many positions, the chairperson of the panchayat at the intermediate and district levels may be elected indirectly.  The mode of election for these positions may vary across states.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for women in Panchayati Raj institutions.  This provision aims to ensure greater participation of women in local governance.  At least one-third of the total number of seats are reserved for women.


**15. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President.
2. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of Parliament but cannot vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President. This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Cabinet.  The Attorney General holds the highest legal office in the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of Parliament, offering legal advice and opinions.  However, the Attorney General cannot vote in Parliament, as they are not a member of either House.  Their role is advisory and not directly legislative or executive.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Duties:**

1. Fundamental Duties are enforceable by courts of law.
2. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Duties are *not* enforceable by courts.  They are moral obligations on citizens, not legally binding duties like Fundamental Rights.  They aim to instill a sense of civic responsibility and national identity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution, not Part III. Part III contains the Fundamental Rights, while Part IV-A was added later through the 42nd Amendment to include Fundamental Duties.


**17. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can pardon a death sentence.
2. The President can reject a Money Bill.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. This power extends to death sentences.  The President's power in this regard is an important constitutional safeguard.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President cannot reject a Money Bill.  The President must give assent to a Money Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament.  The President's role in relation to Money Bills is largely ceremonial.  The President cannot withhold or delay assent to a Money Bill.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment.
2. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment in 1951.  This was done to protect certain land reform laws from judicial scrutiny.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While laws initially placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has since ruled that this immunity is not absolute.  Laws in the Ninth Schedule can be challenged in court if they violate fundamental rights or are otherwise unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court has limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection against judicial review.


**19. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body.
2. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations only on receiving complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body.  It is an independent institution, but its existence and powers are derived from legislation, not the Constitution itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NHRC does investigate complaints regarding human rights violations, it also has the power to take *suo moto* cognizance of violations.  This means it can initiate investigations on its own, without waiting for complaints to be filed.  This suo moto power is crucial for the NHRC's effectiveness.


**20. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination.
2.  The UPSC's jurisdiction can be extended by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination, which is the primary means of recruitment for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and other central services.  The UPSC plays a crucial role in maintaining the meritocratic nature of the civil services.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament can extend the UPSC's jurisdiction to include the personnel system of any local authority, corporate body, or public institution.  This power enables the UPSC to play a broader role in ensuring merit-based recruitment and fair personnel practices across various sectors.  The Parliament's power to extend the UPSC's jurisdiction is a key feature.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a constitutionally mandated body comprising three members, including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Indian Constitution. It's a multi-member body, but the number of members is not fixed at five; it currently comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.  The Constitution only mandates a Chief Election Commissioner; the addition of Election Commissioners was done later through legislation to enhance efficiency and impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The responsibility for deciding the election schedule rests with the Election Commission of India, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice or any other ministry.  The ECI enjoys autonomy in conducting elections, and its independence is crucial for the integrity of the electoral process. The Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters related to the framing and amendment of laws, but not the operational aspects of elections.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed only when the state government fails to function according to the constitutional provisions.
2. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the state legislative assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 356 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to impose President's rule (also known as Article 356) in a state when the state government is unable to function according to the constitutional provisions. This can happen due to various reasons, such as breakdown of constitutional machinery, internal disturbances, or a situation where the state government is unable to maintain law and order.  The decision to impose President's rule is based on a report from the Governor and must be approved by the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the state legislative assembly is often dissolved during President's rule, it is not an automatic consequence. The President can choose to dissolve the assembly, but this is not mandatory. The decision to dissolve the assembly depends on the specific circumstances and the judgment of the President and the central government. The President's rule can also be imposed without dissolving the assembly.


**3. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a strong center with significant power vested in the Union Government.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is based on a rigid division of powers, with minimal scope for flexibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a federal system, but with a strong centralizing tendency. The Union Government holds significant powers, particularly in areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency.  While states have their own legislative and administrative powers, the Union Government has the power to intervene in state matters in certain circumstances, such as during emergencies (Article 356) or when national interests are at stake. This makes the Indian federal structure more akin to a quasi-federal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The distribution of powers in India is not entirely rigid.  The Constitution includes a Concurrent List, where both the Union and State governments can legislate.  Moreover, the Union Government can legislate on subjects in the State List during national emergencies or when it receives a resolution from the Rajya Sabha to do so.  This flexibility allows for adaptation to changing circumstances and national priorities.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding local self-government in India:**

1. Local self-government is an exercise in democratic decentralization, aiming to empower local communities in decision-making.
2. The Constitution of India mandates a three-tier system of panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels in all states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Local self-government in India, particularly through the Panchayati Raj system (for rural areas) and urban local bodies (for urban areas), is a key aspect of democratic decentralization.  It aims to bring governance closer to the people, allowing them to participate directly in decision-making processes affecting their lives. This empowers communities and promotes greater accountability and responsiveness of governance.

Statement 2 is partially correct but requires clarification.  While the 73rd Constitutional Amendment (1992) mandates a three-tier panchayati raj system in principle, its implementation varies across states. The specific structure and functioning of panchayats are subject to state-level legislation, which may lead to variations in the actual implementation of the three-tier system.  Therefore, while the intention is a three-tier system, it's not uniformly implemented in all states.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend any Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill but cannot amend it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does not have the power to amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  Money Bills deal exclusively with financial matters, and the Lok Sabha enjoys greater authority in this domain.  The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject these recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only return the bill to the Lok Sabha with its recommendations within 14 days. If the Lok Sabha accepts the recommendations, the bill is passed; if it rejects them, the bill is deemed to be passed.  The Rajya Sabha's role in Money Bills is limited to offering suggestions, not veto power.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government finances.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Council of Ministers in India:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. Individual ministers are responsible to the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means that the entire Council must resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  A vote of no-confidence can be moved against the Council, and if it's passed, the government is obligated to resign.  This principle ensures the accountability of the executive to the legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister, they are individually responsible to the Parliament, not solely to the President.  They are answerable for their actions and portfolios in Parliament, and can be questioned and held accountable for their performance.  The President's role is largely ceremonial in this context.


**7. With reference to the judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to invalidate laws and executive actions that are inconsistent with the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India is the sole authority to exercise judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Judicial review is a fundamental feature of the Indian Constitution, enabling the judiciary to scrutinize laws and government actions to ensure their conformity with the Constitution. If a law or action is found to be unconstitutional, the judiciary can declare it void. This power safeguards fundamental rights and prevents the government from exceeding its constitutional limits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority on constitutional interpretation, High Courts also possess the power of judicial review within their respective jurisdictions. They can review the constitutionality of state laws and executive actions.  The Supreme Court, however, has the final say in resolving constitutional disputes.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):**

1. DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts of law.
2. DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by guiding the state in its social and economic policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DPSPs are enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution. They are not justiciable, meaning courts cannot directly enforce them.  This is because they deal with socio-economic goals that require gradual implementation and may involve policy choices that are best left to the legislature and executive.

Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs guide the state in formulating policies that promote social and economic welfare. They aim to create a just and equitable society by addressing issues like poverty, inequality, education, and healthcare.  They represent the state's commitment to achieving social justice and a welfare state, even though their implementation isn't subject to judicial enforcement.


**9. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after a specific date are subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Initially, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were considered immune from judicial review. This was intended to protect land reforms and other legislation from legal challenges. However, this immunity was not absolute and was challenged in various court cases.

Statement 2 is correct. In the landmark case of *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu*, the Supreme Court held that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.  This means that these laws can be challenged in court if they violate fundamental rights or the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Court's decision limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection against judicial scrutiny.


**10. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.  The appointment is a formal process, but the President typically acts on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.  The Governor's position is an important part of the Centre-State relationship in the Indian federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can remove the Governor from office at any time, although this is rarely done.  The phrase "during the pleasure of the President" indicates that the Governor's tenure is subject to the President's discretion, reflecting the ultimate authority of the central government in the federal system.  It's a constitutional safeguard against potential misuse of gubernatorial power.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of Parliament but cannot vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General for India is appointed by the President of India under Article 76 of the Constitution. This is a significant constitutional position, and the appointee is typically a distinguished jurist with extensive experience in legal matters.  The Attorney General acts as the government's chief legal advisor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Attorney General has the right to participate in the proceedings of Parliament, including both Houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), but they do not have the right to vote.  Their participation is vital for providing legal advice and representing the government's position on legal issues that come before Parliament.  The lack of voting rights is consistent with their advisory role.


**12. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and enjoys a high degree of independence and security of tenure.  Their independence is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the audit process and maintaining the accountability of government spending.  The appointment reflects the constitutional significance of the CAG's role in safeguarding public finances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments. This ensures that public funds are utilized efficiently, transparently, and in accordance with the law.  The CAG's reports are presented to Parliament and state legislatures, promoting accountability and public scrutiny of government finances.  Their role is essential for maintaining fiscal discipline and preventing corruption.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget in India:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister.
2. No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, which details the government's revenue and expenditure plans for the financial year, is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister. This is a significant event in the Indian political and economic calendar, attracting considerable public and media attention.  The presentation of the budget initiates the parliamentary process of its approval.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 265 of the Indian Constitution states that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India (the main account of the government's revenue) without the authorization of the Parliament. This constitutional provision reinforces the Parliament's control over government spending and ensures that public funds are utilized in accordance with the approved budget.  This safeguard prevents unauthorized withdrawals and promotes fiscal responsibility.


**14. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the chairperson of the NDC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body; it is a non-statutory body established by a resolution of the government.  It plays an important role in coordinating the planning process between the Union and State Governments, but its existence does not stem from a constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister of India is the chairperson of the NDC.  The NDC's composition includes the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers of all states, and other Union Ministers.  Its meetings provide a platform for discussing and coordinating national development plans and policies, ensuring a degree of cooperation between the Centre and the States in the planning process.  The Prime Minister's chairmanship reflects the central government's leadership role in national development.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs):**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of PRIs in all states.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 mandated the establishment of a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in all states. This aimed to decentralize power and bring governance closer to the grassroots level.  However, the specific structure and implementation of this three-tier system may vary across different states depending on their local conditions and legislative frameworks.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gram Sabha, as defined by the 73rd Amendment, is a body comprising all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village within the area of a village-level Panchayat. It plays a significant role in local governance, particularly in the planning and implementation of development programs.  The Gram Sabha's participation ensures greater community involvement in decision-making.


**16. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to move the courts for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed by the Constitution, are not absolute.  They can be reasonably restricted by the state in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc.  The extent of these restrictions is subject to judicial scrutiny to prevent arbitrary limitations.  The balance between individual rights and societal needs is a crucial aspect of constitutional law.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 32 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies. This is considered the most important of all Fundamental Rights, as it empowers citizens to approach the courts for the enforcement of their Fundamental Rights.  This right ensures that the judiciary can play an active role in protecting individual liberties and preventing violations by the state.  The Supreme Court has recognized the importance of this right, and it's essential for upholding the rule of law.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the features of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Indian Constitution is a federal constitution with a unitary bias.
2.  The Indian Constitution provides for a parliamentary form of government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a federal structure, but with a significant centralizing tendency.  While states have their own legislative and administrative powers, the Union Government's powers are extensive, particularly in areas such as defense, foreign affairs, and currency.  The Constitution allows for the Union Government to intervene in state matters under specific circumstances, leading to a description of the system as "federal with a unitary bias."

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution provides for a parliamentary form of government.  This means that the executive (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the legislature (Parliament).  The Prime Minister and Council of Ministers are answerable to the Lok Sabha, and they must maintain the confidence of the lower house to remain in power.  This feature is central to the functioning of the Indian political system.


**18. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act aims to empower citizens by providing them with access to information held by public authorities.
2.  The Act mandates that all information held by public authorities must be disclosed without any exceptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation that empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities. This promotes transparency and accountability in government functioning.  The Act provides a mechanism for citizens to request information and obtain it within a specified timeframe.  It is a crucial tool for ensuring good governance and preventing corruption.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act promotes transparency, it does include certain exceptions to the disclosure of information.  These exceptions are intended to protect sensitive information, such as national security, personal privacy, and commercial confidentiality.  The balance between the right to information and the need to protect such information is a key consideration in the implementation of the Act.  The exceptions are not absolute and are subject to judicial review.


**19. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1.  The UPSC is a constitutional body.
2. The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to the All India Services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Indian Constitution.  Its constitutional status ensures its independence and impartiality in recruitment to civil services.  This independence is vital for maintaining the integrity of the recruitment process and ensuring that appointments are based on merit.

Statement 2 is correct. The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to the All India Services (IAS, IPS, IFS), as well as other central government services.  These examinations are highly competitive and are designed to select candidates based on their merit and suitability for government service.  The UPSC plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and professionalism of the civil services.


**20. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a statutory body established under an Act of Parliament.
2. The NGT has the power to adjudicate environmental disputes and impose penalties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NGT is a statutory body established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  Its establishment was aimed at providing a specialized and efficient mechanism for addressing environmental disputes and reducing the burden on the higher courts.  The Act defines its powers and jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT has the power to adjudicate environmental disputes and impose penalties for violations of environmental laws.  This includes cases related to pollution, deforestation, and other environmental issues.  The NGT's powers are designed to ensure the effective enforcement of environmental laws and the protection of the environment.  The Tribunal's decisions can have significant environmental and legal implications.



**1. With reference to the features of Parliamentary and Presidential systems, consider the following statements:**

1. In a Parliamentary system, the executive and legislature are interdependent, while in a Presidential system, there's a clear separation of powers.
2.  A Parliamentary system typically features a single executive (Prime Minister), whereas a Presidential system has a dual executive (President and Prime Minister).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The parliamentary system is characterized by a fusion of powers between the executive and legislature. The executive (the government) is drawn from and accountable to the legislature (the parliament).  The legislature can remove the executive through a vote of no confidence. Conversely, the Presidential system emphasizes a strict separation of powers, with the executive (President) and legislature (Congress) operating independently and with distinct powers.  The President is not directly accountable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some semi-presidential systems have a dual executive (President and Prime Minister),  a pure Presidential system has a single executive, the President, who is both head of state and head of government. The Prime Minister is a feature of parliamentary systems, where they lead the government and are accountable to the parliament.  The statement conflates the characteristics of different systems.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution's adoption of the Parliamentary system:**

1. The Constituent Assembly's familiarity with the British parliamentary system influenced its adoption, as it had been operational in India during British rule.
2.  The preference for a Parliamentary system stemmed from a desire to prioritize governmental stability over accountability, mirroring the American model.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constituent Assembly members had firsthand experience with the parliamentary system under the British Raj.  Figures like K.M. Munshi explicitly argued for its continuation, citing its established presence and familiarity as reasons to avoid a novel, untested system. This historical context significantly shaped the decision-making process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's arguments in the Constituent Assembly highlighted the inherent trade-off between stability and responsibility in governmental systems.  He explicitly stated that the Indian Constitution, in choosing the parliamentary system, prioritized responsibility over stability, contrasting it with the American system which he viewed as offering more stability but less responsibility.  The statement misrepresents the Constituent Assembly's rationale.


**3. With reference to the distinctions between the Indian and British parliamentary models, consider the following statements:**

1. Unlike the British system's doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the Indian Parliament's power is limited by a written constitution, federalism, judicial review, and fundamental rights.
2. In Britain, the Prime Minister must be a member of the Lower House, while in India, the Prime Minister can be a member of either House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British Parliament is considered supreme, its legislation not subject to constitutional limitations. In contrast, India's parliamentary system operates within the framework of a written constitution, which establishes fundamental rights, limits parliamentary power, and empowers judicial review. The federal structure further divides powers between the Union and States, further limiting the Parliament's authority.

Statement 2 is also correct.  In the British system, convention dictates that the Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons (the Lower House).  The Indian Constitution, however, doesn't impose such a restriction; the Prime Minister can be a member of either the Lok Sabha (Lower House) or the Rajya Sabha (Upper House).  This reflects a key difference in the two systems' operational norms.


**4. With reference to the features of Federal and Unitary Governments, consider the following statements:**

1. A federal government features a dual government (national and regional), whereas a unitary government has a single government that may create regional administrations.
2.  A federal government necessitates a written constitution with a clear division of powers, unlike unitary governments where the constitution may be written or unwritten.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a fundamental difference. Federal systems distribute governmental authority between a central government and constituent units (states, provinces, etc.), each with independent jurisdiction. Unitary systems concentrate power in the central government, although regional or local administrations may exist, deriving their authority from the central government.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While some unitary states have written constitutions (e.g., France), others do not (e.g., the United Kingdom).  A defining feature of federalism is the presence of a written constitution that explicitly outlines the division of powers between the central and regional levels of government. This written constitution is crucial for defining the relationship and preventing conflicts.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the formation of a federation:**

1. Federations can be formed through integration (multiple independent states uniting) or disintegration (a large unitary state granting autonomy to its regions).
2. The United States, formed in 1787, is the oldest federation globally, while Canada, formed in 1867, is a relatively recent example.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Federations can arise from two distinct pathways.  Integration involves several previously independent entities agreeing to form a new, unified political system, as exemplified by the United States.  Disintegration, conversely, occurs when a pre-existing unitary state reorganizes itself into a federal structure by granting significant autonomy to its constituent parts, as seen in the Canadian federation's evolution.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the United States is indeed one of the oldest federations,  Canada's federation is not a recent example, dating back to 1867—making it a considerably established federation, not a recent one.  The statement misrepresents the historical timeline of Canada's federal formation.


**6. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "federation" is explicitly used in the Indian Constitution to describe the structure of the Indian government.
2. The phrase "Union of States," used in Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, implies that the Indian federation is indestructible and states cannot secede.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not use the term "federation" but instead employs the phrase "Union of States" in Article 1 to define the country's structure. This choice of terminology has significant constitutional implications.

Statement 2 is correct.  B.R. Ambedkar's explanation of the term "Union of States" emphasizes its implications for the indivisibility of the Indian federation.  It signifies that unlike federations formed through agreements between previously independent states (like the US), the Indian federation is not a mere contract, and its constituent units have no inherent right to secession. This reflects a strong emphasis on national unity.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Directive Principles primarily aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.
2. These principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) outline the socio-economic goals that the Indian state should strive to achieve.  They aim to create a society that is more just, equitable, and socially just, focusing on areas such as social security, education, healthcare, and economic justice.  They are a roadmap for achieving a more inclusive and welfare-oriented state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key characteristic of the DPSPs is their non-justiciability.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not directly enforceable by courts of law.  The courts cannot compel the state to implement them.  However, they serve as guidelines for the government's policy-making and are increasingly used by the courts in interpreting other laws and policies.  They represent the state's commitment to social and economic goals.


**8. With reference to the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend Money Bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can vote on the Demands for Grants included in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha's powers are limited regarding Money Bills. It cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept. The Lok Sabha has ultimate authority over Money Bills.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.  This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on individual budget items. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters.


**9. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. The Act established a clear demarcation of the jurisdictions of the central and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not establish a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.  The executive and legislative functions remained intertwined, and the judiciary's independence was not fully established.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant aspect of the 1919 Act was its introduction of diarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level.  This involved a division of subjects between the central and provincial governments, with certain subjects falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.  This represented a step towards greater provincial autonomy.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding the passage of a bill in a joint sitting of Parliament:**

1. A bill referred to a joint sitting must be passed by a simple majority of members present and voting.
2.  In a joint sitting, the bill needs a two-thirds majority for passage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. If a bill fails to pass in both houses of Parliament, the Constitution allows for a joint sitting of both houses. In such a sitting, the bill is passed by a simple majority of the total number of members of both houses present and voting.  This is a crucial mechanism for resolving legislative deadlock.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A joint sitting requires only a simple majority for the passage of a bill, not a two-thirds majority.  The two-thirds majority requirement applies to specific constitutional amendments, not to ordinary legislation passed in a joint sitting. The statement conflates the voting requirements for different types of legislative processes.


**11. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. The NITI Aayog replaced the Human Rights Commission of India.
2. The NITI Aayog succeeded the Planning Commission of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank, not a human rights body. The Human Rights Commission is an independent institution dealing with human rights violations. The statement incorrectly links two unrelated organizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NITI Aayog was established by the Indian government in 2015 to replace the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission was responsible for centralized economic planning, while the NITI Aayog focuses on cooperative federalism and collaborative policy formulation with states. The statement accurately reflects the organizational change.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Executive Power of the Union of India:**

1. The executive power of the Union of India is vested solely in the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is an ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President, not solely in the Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers and exercises significant executive power, the President is the constitutional head of the executive branch. The statement misrepresents the constitutional distribution of executive power.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the Civil Services Board, a crucial body dealing with matters related to the All India Services. This reflects the Prime Minister's role in overseeing the higher echelons of the civil service.


**13. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.
2. The Sixth Schedule is concerned with the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution provides for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas (areas with significant tribal populations) and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  It empowers the President to issue regulations for these areas.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Sixth Schedule outlines the specific administrative arrangements for tribal areas in four northeastern states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It creates autonomous district councils and regional councils with significant powers over local governance.  Both schedules address distinct aspects of tribal administration and welfare.


**14. With reference to the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing the Union Budget presented to Parliament.
2.  No funds can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without Parliament's authorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in budget preparation, it's not the sole entity involved.  Other departments and ministries contribute to the budget process, with the Finance Ministry having overall responsibility.  The statement oversimplifies the complex process of Union Budget creation.

Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy is that the government cannot spend public money without legislative approval.  The Consolidated Fund of India, which holds all government revenues, requires Parliament's authorization for any withdrawals. This ensures legislative control over government finances.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the custodian of the Constitution of India:**

1. The President of India is the sole custodian of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President is the constitutional head of the country and upholds the Constitution, but the Constitution is not solely under their custodianship.  The Constitution's authority rests on the people of India and is upheld by various institutions, including the judiciary and the legislature.  The statement incorrectly attributes sole custodianship to the President.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court, plays a vital role in interpreting the Constitution, resolving disputes regarding its provisions, and ensuring its supremacy. Its power of judicial review makes it a key institution in safeguarding the Constitution.


**16. With reference to the recent conferral of classical language status, consider the following statements:**

1. Odia has recently been granted classical language status.
2. Bhojpuri has recently been granted classical language status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While several languages have been granted classical language status by the Indian government, Odia is not among the recently added ones. The statement gives an incorrect language.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Bhojpuri has not yet been granted classical language status.  The statement names a language that has not yet received this designation.  The classical language status is given based on specific criteria and is not frequently awarded.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Legislative Council of a State in India:**

1. A State Legislative Council can be larger than half the size of the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State appoints the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution sets a limit on the size of a State Legislative Council. It cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly. The statement misrepresents the constitutional limits on the Council's size.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a State nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council.  This is one of the Governor's powers related to the state legislature. The statement correctly identifies the appointing authority.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India":**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. This provision is included among the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The phrase "To secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" is explicitly stated in the Preamble. This reflects the foundational values of the Indian state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While upholding the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India is a crucial national goal, it's not explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Duty in Part IVA of the Constitution. The statement incorrectly places the provision under Fundamental Duties.


**19.  With reference to the fundamental objects of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Panchayati Raj system aims to promote people's participation in development.
2.  It primarily seeks to achieve financial mobilization at the local level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Panchayati Raj system is designed to empower local communities and promote their participation in decision-making processes related to development.  It aims to decentralize power and resources, enabling local communities to address their specific needs and priorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While financial mobilization is a desirable outcome of a functioning Panchayati Raj system, it is not the primary objective. The primary goals are democratic decentralization, increased participation, and improved local governance. The statement incorrectly prioritizes financial mobilization over the broader goals.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the "Welfare State" ideal in the Indian Constitution:**

1. The concept of a Welfare State is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) contain the essence of the Welfare State ideal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Preamble reflects the overall goals of the Constitution, including social justice and equality, it does not explicitly mention the term "Welfare State." The statement misattributes the location of the concept.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs, in Part IV of the Constitution, embody the principles of a Welfare State. They provide guidelines for the state to pursue social and economic policies aimed at improving the well-being of its citizens.  They are the constitutional basis for the government's welfare-oriented actions.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding the existence of a Parliamentary system of government in India:**

1. The Lok Sabha's direct election by the people is a defining feature of the Parliamentary system.
2. The Council of Ministers' accountability to the Lok Sabha is a key characteristic of the Indian Parliamentary system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The direct election of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) by the people is a fundamental aspect of India's democratic system, and it is integral to the functioning of the Parliamentary system.  This ensures that the government is ultimately accountable to the people's representatives.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A core principle of the Parliamentary system is that the executive branch (Council of Ministers) is accountable to the legislature (Parliament).  The Lok Sabha, being the lower house and the one directly elected by the people, holds the executive accountable through votes of no confidence, debates, and other parliamentary processes.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the lapsing of bills in the Indian Parliament:**

1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses upon its prorogation (adjournment).
2. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which hasn't been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse upon the Lok Sabha's dissolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  According to the rules of parliamentary procedure, a bill pending in the Lok Sabha automatically lapses if the Lok Sabha is prorogued (adjourned indefinitely). This is a standard parliamentary procedure.

Statement 2 is also correct. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that hasn't yet been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse if the Lok Sabha is dissolved.  The bill will need to be re-introduced in the newly constituted Lok Sabha if it is to be considered further.  This reflects the differing roles of the two houses in the legislative process.


**23. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment and tenure of a State Chief Secretary:**

1. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary.
2. A State Chief Secretary has a fixed tenure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chief Secretary of a State is appointed by the Governor of that State.  This is a constitutional provision related to the state's executive branch. The Governor exercises this power usually on the advice of the state government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A State Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure. Their appointment is typically for a period of time determined by the government.  They can also be transferred or reassigned at any time at the discretion of the government.  The statement incorrectly assumes a fixed tenure.


**24. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas can hear both civil and criminal cases.
2. The Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators/reconciliators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act aims to provide accessible justice at the village level.  These courts have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases, addressing a wide range of disputes within their specified areas.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A notable feature of the Gram Nyayalayas Act is its provision for the inclusion of local social activists as mediators or conciliators.  This reflects an effort to involve the community in dispute resolution and promote alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.


**25. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament's power to legislate on State List items:**

1. A resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority is sufficient to enable Parliament to legislate on a State List item in the national interest.
2. A resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority empowers Parliament to legislate on a State List item.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 249 of the Indian Constitution permits Parliament to legislate on matters in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary in the national interest.  A simple majority in the Rajya Sabha is sufficient for such a resolution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not require a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha for such a resolution.  The statement incorrectly specifies the required majority. Only a simple majority vote in the Rajya Sabha is required.


**26. Consider the following statements regarding the minimum age for Panchayat membership and reconstitution after premature dissolution:**

1. The minimum age for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.
2. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution serves only for the remaining period of its original term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution of India specifies that the minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years.  This is a crucial provision that ensures that individuals of a certain maturity and understanding can participate in local governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, the reconstituted Panchayat serves only for the remainder of the original term for which it was constituted. This prevents undue extension of a Panchayat's term.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals:**

1. The proposals primarily focused on social reforms.
2. The proposals dealt with constitutional reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms had some indirect impact on social issues, their primary focus was not social reforms.  They were primarily concerned with constitutional changes and the devolution of power.  The statement incorrectly identifies the main focus of the proposals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced in 1918, proposed significant constitutional changes in India, including the introduction of diarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level and some extensions of self-government.  These proposals were a crucial step in the evolution of India's constitutional framework.


**28. With reference to the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Preamble explicitly includes the objective of economic liberty.
2. The Preamble mentions liberty of thought, expression, and belief.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to establish a just and equitable society, it does not explicitly mention "economic liberty" as a distinct objective.  The Preamble focuses on broader concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity.  The statement incorrectly interprets the Preamble's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Preamble explicitly mentions "Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship" as among the objectives of the Constitution.  These are fundamental freedoms guaranteed to all citizens.


**29. With reference to the Right against Exploitation in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right against Exploitation prohibits forced labor and human trafficking.
2. The Right against Exploitation includes the abolition of untouchability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Articles 23 and 24 of the Indian Constitution, under the Right against Exploitation, explicitly prohibit forced labor (begar) and human trafficking.  These are significant provisions ensuring human dignity and freedom from exploitation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the abolition of untouchability is a crucial aspect of social justice, it is addressed under the Right to Equality (Article 17), not specifically under the Right against Exploitation. The statement incorrectly places abolition of untouchability under the Right against Exploitation.


**30. Consider the following statements about Fundamental Rights in India:**

1. Fundamental Rights are claims of the state against its citizens.
2. Fundamental Rights are claims of the citizens against the state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are not claims of the state against its citizens.  They are limitations on the state's power, protecting individual liberties and freedoms from government encroachment.  The statement misrepresents the nature of Fundamental Rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Rights are primarily claims that citizens can make against the state, ensuring that the state respects their basic rights and freedoms.  They are a crucial safeguard against state overreach and arbitrary actions.


**31. Consider the following statements regarding Fundamental Duties in India:**

1.  A legislative process exists to enforce Fundamental Duties.
2. Fundamental Duties are correlative to Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, there is no specific legislative process to directly enforce Fundamental Duties.  They are moral obligations on citizens, not legally enforceable duties. The statement wrongly assumes the existence of an enforcement mechanism.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Fundamental Duties and Fundamental Rights are interconnected, they are not strictly correlative.  Fundamental Rights are legal entitlements, while Fundamental Duties are moral obligations.  The statement oversimplifies the relationship between the two.


**32. Consider the following statements about the relationship between Rights and Duties in India:**

1. Rights and duties are inherently intertwined and interdependent.
2. Rights are solely personal and independent of societal responsibilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A fundamental principle of democratic citizenship is the interconnectedness of rights and duties.  Rights and responsibilities are mutually reinforcing; the enjoyment of rights comes with the responsibility to uphold them and respect the rights of others.  This is a crucial aspect of a functional democracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Rights are not solely personal and independent of societal responsibilities.  The exercise of rights has implications for society, and citizens have a responsibility to exercise their rights responsibly and without infringing on the rights of others.  The statement presents a simplistic and inaccurate view of rights.


**33. Consider the following statements regarding the addition to Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women.
2. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of participation of workers in the management of industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women to the Directive Principles of State Policy.  This reflects the constitutional commitment to gender equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The principle of worker participation in industrial management was not added by the 42nd Amendment. While worker participation is a desirable goal, it was not explicitly added as a new directive principle by this amendment.  The statement attributes a principle to the wrong amendment.


**34. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements regarding Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. Directive Principles of State Policy constitute limitations upon legislative functions.
2. Directive Principles of State Policy constitute limitations upon executive functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While not directly enforceable by courts, the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) serve as guidelines for both the legislature and the executive.  They guide the legislature in framing laws that promote social and economic justice.  Laws that contradict the spirit of DPSPs can be challenged on grounds of reasonableness and proportionality.

Statement 2 is also correct. The DPSPs equally influence the

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are enforceable by courts of law.
2.  They aim to establish a socio-economic democracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are not justiciable. This means they are not legally enforceable by courts.  While they guide the state's policy and actions, they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The courts cannot compel the government to implement them.  They are considered as goals that the state should strive to achieve.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs aim to create a just and equitable society, fostering social and economic justice. They represent the socio-economic vision of the Constitution, aiming to build a welfare state that addresses social and economic inequalities.  They aim to create a society where basic necessities are available to all, promoting social harmony and economic equality.  The various directives cover areas like education, healthcare, social security, and worker's rights.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha's powers:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can vote on Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does not have the power to reject a Money Bill.  A Money Bill, dealing primarily with financial matters, can only be delayed by the Rajya Sabha for a maximum of 14 days.  The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has the final say on Money Bills.  This reflects the principle of financial supremacy of the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.  Demands for Grants are part of the budget process, where the Lok Sabha approves the government's spending proposals. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the Demands for Grants and suggest amendments, but it cannot vote on them.  This again underlines the Lok Sabha's preeminent role in financial matters.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. It clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. It established a system of dyarchy at the provincial level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.  While it made some changes to the administrative structure,  the separation of powers was not a central feature of the Act. The Act primarily focused on expanding the legislative councils and introducing a limited form of responsible government.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1919 Act introduced a system of dyarchy (dual government) at the provincial level.  This meant that some subjects were administered by ministers responsible to the legislature, while others remained under the direct control of the Governor.  This was a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance but also a complex system of shared power.


**4. With reference to a joint sitting of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A joint sitting can be called to resolve a deadlock between the two Houses on a non-Money Bill.
2.  A joint sitting requires a two-thirds majority for the passage of a bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 108 of the Indian Constitution allows for a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament to resolve a deadlock on a non-Money Bill. If the two Houses fail to agree on a bill (other than a Money Bill) after it has been passed by one House and rejected or amended by the other, the President can summon a joint sitting.  At the joint sitting, the bill is passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A joint sitting requires a simple majority of the members present and voting, not a two-thirds majority.  The threshold for a simple majority is lower than the special majorities required for certain constitutional amendments.  The simple majority in a joint sitting reflects the principle of majority rule in a parliamentary system.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Finance Commission.
2. It is a constitutional body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) replaced the Planning Commission. The Finance Commission is a separate constitutional body responsible for recommending the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States. NITI Aayog focuses on national development and policy formulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is not a constitutional body. It was established by a resolution of the Union government.  Its establishment was done through executive action, not through a constitutional amendment.  While it plays a significant role in national planning and development, it does not have the same constitutional standing as bodies like the Election Commission or the Finance Commission.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Executive Power of the Union:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union is vested solely in the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Civil Services Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 53 of the Indian Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President. However, it is important to note that the President exercises this power on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Prime Minister is not the Chairman of the Civil Services Board. This is a misconception. The Civil Services Board is chaired by the Cabinet Secretary.  The Prime Minister's role is primarily that of the head of the government, and while he or she influences policy regarding the civil services, they do not directly chair the Civil Services Board.


**7. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.
2. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in the states. It provides for the establishment of tribal advisory councils in these areas to protect tribal interests.  The provisions aim to safeguard the rights and welfare of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration of tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It creates autonomous district councils and regional councils to manage these areas, giving tribal communities more autonomy in governance.  This aims to empower tribal populations and preserve their cultural identity.


**8. With reference to the Union Government's financial procedures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2.  Parliamentary authorization is required for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in the preparation of the Union Budget, it is not solely responsible.  Other departments and ministries also contribute to the budget preparation process, providing details of their expenditure requirements and revenue projections. The Finance Ministry plays a coordinating role in the overall budget preparation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 112 of the Constitution states that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  This reflects the principle of parliamentary control over public finance.  The budget must be approved by Parliament before the government can spend any money from the Consolidated Fund.


**9. With reference to the custodian of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is the sole custodian of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President of India is the head of state, but not the sole custodian of the Constitution.  The Constitution is a living document, and its interpretation and application are ongoing processes.  Various institutions and individuals play a role in upholding and interpreting the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court of the land, plays a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution. Through judicial review, it determines the constitutionality of laws and government actions.  Its decisions shape the understanding and application of the Constitution, making it a vital institution for upholding constitutional principles.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the classical language status:**

1.  The status of a classical language is conferred by the Parliament.
2.  Only Sanskrit and Tamil have been granted classical language status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The status of a classical language is conferred by the Government of India, not the Parliament. The decision is made through an executive order by the Ministry of Culture. While Parliament can certainly pass laws related to language, the specific designation of "classical language" is an executive function.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  More than two languages have been granted classical language status.  Sanskrit and Tamil were among the first, but other languages like Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia, and Pali have also received this recognition.  The criteria for classical language status include antiquity, a rich and significant literary tradition, and a distinct linguistic identity.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding State Legislative Councils:**

1. A State Legislative Council can be larger than the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State appoints the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A State Legislative Council cannot be larger than the State Legislative Assembly.  The maximum strength of a Legislative Council is fixed at one-third of the total number of members of the Assembly, reflecting the Assembly's primary legislative role.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a State nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council from among its members. This power of the Governor is an aspect of his or her role in the state legislature.  The Chairman presides over the Council's proceedings.


**12. With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Fundamental Rights.
2. It is a part of the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provision "To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India" is not a part of the Fundamental Rights. Fundamental Rights are primarily concerned with individual liberties and freedoms.

Statement 2 is correct. This provision is included in the Fundamental Duties (Part IV-A of the Constitution), emphasizing the citizen's responsibility to maintain the nation's unity and integrity. The Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable but represent moral obligations on citizens.


**13. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1.  It aims to achieve financial mobilization exclusively at the village level.
2.  It primarily focuses on political accountability at the state level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Panchayati Raj system aims to achieve financial mobilization at all levels—village, intermediate, and district. It involves empowering local bodies to raise their own resources and manage finances effectively.  Financial mobilization is not limited to the village level but is a broader objective across the tiers of the system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Panchayati Raj system aims to achieve political accountability at all levels—local, intermediate, and state. It is about empowering local bodies and making them accountable to the people they represent. Accountability is a fundamental principle of democratic governance and not limited to the state level.


**14. With reference to the "Welfare State" ideal in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The ideal of a Welfare State is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble.
2. It is primarily enshrined in the Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution does not explicitly mention the term "Welfare State." While the Preamble aims to establish a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic ensuring justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, the specific concept of a welfare state is not explicitly stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ideal of a Welfare State is not primarily enshrined in the Fundamental Rights. While Fundamental Rights protect individual liberties, the concept of a welfare state is more closely linked to the Directive Principles of State Policy, which guide the state towards establishing a society that ensures social and economic justice.


**15. With reference to the Parliamentary System of Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha's dissolution is a prerequisite for the parliamentary system.
2.  The Council of Ministers' responsibility to the Lok Sabha is a defining feature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) is not subject to dissolution. It is a permanent House, unlike the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which is dissolved after a fixed term or earlier if the government loses a vote of no confidence.  The permanence of the Rajya Sabha ensures continuity in legislative processes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Council of Ministers' responsibility to the Lok Sabha is a defining characteristic of the parliamentary system in India.  The government must maintain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power.  A vote of no confidence or a defeat on a major policy issue can lead to the resignation or dismissal of the government.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the lapse of Bills in Parliament:**

1. A Bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses upon its prorogation.
2. A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, not passed by the Lok Sabha, lapses upon the Lok Sabha's dissolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses if the Lok Sabha is prorogued (its session is adjourned indefinitely) without the bill being passed. Prorogation marks the end of a session, and any pending legislation needs to be reintroduced in the next session.

Statement 2 is correct. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not been passed by the Lok Sabha also lapses upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  Dissolution brings an end to the Lok Sabha's term, and any bill needing its approval must be reintroduced in the newly elected Lok Sabha.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment and tenure of a State's Chief Secretary:**

1. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary.
2. The Chief Secretary has a fixed tenure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state appoints the Chief Secretary, the head of the state's administrative service.  This is done on the advice of the state Council of Ministers, reflecting the principle of ministerial responsibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure.  While there might be some general guidelines, the tenure is largely determined by the state government's needs and the Chief Secretary's performance.  The Chief Secretary can be transferred or replaced at any time by the state government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) can hear both civil and criminal cases.  Their jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses and disputes at the village level, aiming to provide speedy and accessible justice.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators. This aims to promote amicable settlements and reduce the burden on formal court proceedings.  Mediation is encouraged as a means of resolving disputes outside formal court procedures.


**19. With reference to the Parliament's power to legislate on State List items, consider the following statements:**

1. A resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha by a simple majority is sufficient.
2.  A resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a two-thirds majority is required.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Parliament cannot legislate on a State List item based on a simple majority resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha.  The process requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha is not sufficient.  The Parliament can legislate on State List matters in the national interest only if a resolution is passed by both Houses of Parliament.  The resolution does not specify any particular majority requirement.  The national interest clause provides for exceptional legislative powers to the Parliament.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the minimum age for Panchayat members:**

1. The minimum age for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for a person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years, not 25 years. This age limit is set by the Constitution (73rd Amendment Act).

Statement 2 is correct. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues only for the remainder of the original term.  The premature dissolution doesn't alter the original term's duration; the reconstituted body serves for the remaining period.

1. They focused primarily on social reforms.
2. They introduced dyarchy at the central level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals (1918) were primarily concerned with constitutional reforms, not social reforms.  Although some social issues might have been indirectly addressed, the main focus was on reforming the administrative and legislative structure of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms introduced dyarchy at the provincial level, not at the central level.  The central government remained largely under British control.  Dyarchy, or dual governance, was a complex system of shared power between Indian ministers and British officials in provinces.


**22. With reference to the objectives of the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Economic liberty is explicitly mentioned.
2. Liberty of belief is explicitly mentioned.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble explicitly mentions "liberty of belief," along with liberty of thought, expression, and faith.  These are fundamental freedoms that the Constitution seeks to protect.  Liberty of belief is a crucial aspect of individual freedom and religious tolerance.


**23. With reference to the Right against Exploitation in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Abolition of untouchability is included under this right.
2. Protection of the interests of minorities is included under this right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 2 is incorrect. Protection of the interests of minorities is not part of the Right against Exploitation.  The protection of minority interests is addressed under different articles of the Constitution, primarily concerning cultural and religious freedoms.  The Right against Exploitation specifically targets forms of exploitation like forced labor and human trafficking.


**24. With reference to Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted.
2.  They are primarily claims of citizens against the State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are not absolute.  While they are fundamental, they can be reasonably restricted in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  The Constitution itself allows for limitations on these rights, ensuring a balance between individual freedoms and societal needs.

Statement 2 is correct. Fundamental Rights are primarily claims of citizens against the State.  They protect individuals from arbitrary state actions and ensure that the government does not infringe upon their basic rights.  This is a key aspect of a constitutional democracy.


**25. With reference to Fundamental Duties in India, consider the following statements:**

1. They are legally enforceable by courts.
2. They are correlative to Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable by courts. They represent moral obligations on citizens, not legally binding obligations.  While they guide citizen behavior, they cannot be enforced through court actions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Duties are seen as correlative to Fundamental Rights.  The enjoyment of rights comes with responsibilities.  Fundamental Duties emphasize the citizen's role in upholding the Constitution and the values it represents.  This is a crucial aspect of civic responsibility in a democracy.


**26. With reference to the relationship between Rights and Duties in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are independent of duties.
2. Duties are important for the stability of the state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rights and duties are not independent; they are interconnected.  The enjoyment of rights comes with responsibilities.  A responsible citizenry is essential for a functioning democracy.  Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin, promoting civic engagement and social harmony.

Statement 2 is correct.  Duties are crucial for the stability and progress of the state.  A responsible citizenry that respects laws and contributes to societal well-being is essential for a stable and prosperous nation.  This is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance.

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs).  This aimed to promote gender equality in the workplace.

Statement 2 is correct. The 42nd Amendment also added the principle of worker's participation in the management of industries to the DPSPs.  This aimed to enhance industrial relations and improve worker's welfare.  These additions reflect the constitutional commitment to social and economic justice.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy as limitations on governmental functions:**

2. They constitute limitations on the executive function.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) act as guidelines for both the legislature and the executive. They influence the legislative process by guiding lawmakers in framing laws consistent with social and economic justice.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs also guide the executive branch in formulating and implementing policies. They serve as moral and policy directives for the government's actions, influencing the executive's decisions and promoting a welfare state.


**29. With reference to the election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. Only a resident of the constituency can file a nomination paper.
2. Any citizen of India can file a nomination paper.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A candidate does not need to be a resident of the constituency to contest the Lok Sabha elections. While they must be a citizen of India and meet other eligibility criteria, residency within the constituency is not a mandatory requirement.

Statement 2 is correct. Any citizen of India who meets the eligibility criteria can file a nomination paper for the Lok Sabha elections. This reflects the principle of universal adult suffrage.  Citizenship is the primary requirement.


**30. Consider the following statements regarding elections to the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies:**

1. The winning candidate must secure at least 50% of the votes polled.
2. The Speaker's post in the Lok Sabha always goes to the majority party, and the Deputy Speaker's to the opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the first-past-the-post system used for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections, a candidate does not need to secure 50% of the votes polled to win.  A simple majority (more votes than any other candidate) is sufficient to win the election.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Speaker's post in the Lok Sabha typically goes to the majority party, the Deputy Speaker's post does not automatically go to the opposition. The selection of the Deputy Speaker is a parliamentary process, and the opposition may or may not secure the position.  The selection depends on various factors and parliamentary dynamics.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is not a five-member body; it is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  While there are other election commissioners, they do not form a body with collective decision-making power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does not decide the election schedule. The Election Commission of India is an independent body responsible for conducting elections and setting election schedules.

Statement 3 is correct. The Election Commission of India resolves disputes relating to the splits/mergers of recognized political parties. This is a crucial aspect of its role in regulating the political process.


**33. With reference to the consequences of President's Rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly is mandatory.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly is not mandatory when President's Rule is imposed. The President can choose to dissolve the Assembly or allow it to continue functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Removal of the State Council of Ministers is not mandatory when President's Rule is imposed.  The Council of Ministers ceases to function under President's Rule, but removal is not required.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Dissolution of local bodies is not mandatory when President's Rule is imposed.  Local bodies might continue their functions, although the state government's control over them increases under President's Rule.


**34. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The federating units have equal representation in the Rajya Sabha.
2. Indian federalism is based on an agreement among the federating units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The federating units (states) do not have equal representation in the Rajya Sabha. Representation in the Rajya Sabha is based on the population of each state, leading to unequal representation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Indian federalism is not the result of an agreement among the federating units.  It is a constitutional arrangement established by the Constitution, defining the relationship between the Union and the states.  The Constitution lays down the framework for federalism.


**35. With reference to local self-government, consider the following statements:**

1. It is an exercise in federalism.
2. It is an exercise in direct democracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Local self-government can be considered an exercise in federalism as it involves decentralization of power from the central and state governments to local bodies. This is a form of vertical distribution of powers, similar to the federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Local self-government is not an exercise in direct democracy. While it involves people's participation, it is representative democracy where elected representatives make decisions on behalf of the people.  Direct democracy implies direct participation of citizens in decision-making.


**36. With reference to Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Adjournment motion is the primary tool.
2. Supplementary questions are a crucial mechanism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the administrative setup of Union Territories in India:**

1.  Union Territories under the direct control of the Centre do not possess any autonomy.
2.  The executive head of a Union Territory can be designated as an administrator, lieutenant governor, or chief commissioner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Union Territories under the direct administrative control of the central government lack the autonomy enjoyed by states.  They do not have their own legislatures or a separate executive branch with the same powers as a state.  The central government directly governs these territories.

Statement 2 is also correct. The designation of the executive head of a Union Territory varies. While some Union Territories have Lieutenant Governors, others may have Administrators or Chief Commissioners.  This reflects the differing levels of administrative structure and powers granted to different Union Territories. The choice of designation depends on the specific administrative arrangements made by the central government for that particular Union Territory.


**2. With reference to the relationship between the Centre and States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  In a federal structure, states share power with the Centre, unlike the unitary system where the Centre holds supreme authority.
2.  A governor, as a constitutional head of a state, plays a crucial role in maintaining Centre-State relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental difference between federal and unitary systems.  A federal system, like India's, divides powers between the central and state governments, creating a balance of authority. A unitary system, on the other hand, concentrates all significant power in the central government. States within a unitary system are subordinate to the central authority.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor, appointed by the President, serves as the constitutional head of a state. Although primarily a representative of the central government, the Governor's role in approving state legislation, appointing the Chief Minister, and maintaining communication with the central government significantly impacts Centre-State relations.  The Governor's actions, though constitutionally bound, can influence the balance of power and cooperation between the Centre and the states.


**3. With reference to the legislative powers in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament's power to legislate on state list subjects is restricted to exceptional circumstances and requires specific conditions to be met.
2. Parliament can make laws on any subject in the three lists for Union Territories, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution's federal structure limits Parliament's power to legislate on matters listed in the State List.  Parliament can only do so under specific, exceptional circumstances, typically during a national emergency or when the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring a subject of national importance.  This safeguard prevents the central government from encroaching on state autonomy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement reverses the reality of legislative powers regarding Union Territories.  Parliament has broader legislative power over Union Territories. It can legislate on any subject for the Union Territories, including those on the State List, without the need to fulfill the conditions required for legislating on State List matters for States. This reflects the unitary nature of the central government's control over these territories.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas in India:**

1.  The President of India has the power to declare an area as a Scheduled Area, altering its boundaries as needed, in consultation with the state governor.
2.  The Governor of a state with Scheduled Areas has the power to make regulations for the peace and good government of those areas, subject to the President's assent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the President's role in designating Scheduled Areas under the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. The President, after consultation with the state governor, has the authority to declare an area as a Scheduled Area, modify its boundaries, or revoke such designation.  This power underscores the central government's significant role in administering these areas, intended to protect the rights and welfare of tribal populations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor of a state containing Scheduled Areas holds special responsibility for their administration.  The Governor has the authority to make regulations for the peace and good government of Scheduled Areas, including provisions on land transfer, land allotment, and money lending within these areas. However, these regulations are subject to the President's assent, maintaining a check on potential overreach.


**5. With reference to Article 244 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 244 deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas, outlining a special administrative system for these regions.
2.  The Fifth Schedule addresses the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in all states of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 244 of the Indian Constitution outlines a special system of administration for Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas.  These areas, often inhabited by tribal communities, necessitate distinct administrative provisions to address their unique social, economic, and cultural circumstances, ensuring their protection and development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution does not apply to all states. It deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states *except* Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The administration of tribal areas in these four northeastern states is governed by the Sixth Schedule.


**6. With reference to the administration of tribal areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of autonomous districts and regions within specific northeastern states.
2.  The Governor of a state with autonomous districts has the power to reorganize these districts, including altering their boundaries or names.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India provides a unique administrative structure for tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It enables the formation of autonomous districts and regions within these states, granting significant self-governance powers to the tribal populations.  This reflects a recognition of the distinct cultural and administrative needs of these communities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor of the concerned state plays a crucial role in managing the autonomous districts. The Governor has the power to reorganize these districts, altering their boundaries, changing their names, or dividing them into autonomous regions. This power is intended to adapt the administrative structure to the evolving needs of the tribal communities and the changing demographic landscape.  However, this power is not absolute and is subject to constitutional limitations and regulations.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the  NITI Aayog:**

1. NITI Aayog is a statutory body established by an act of Parliament.
2. The Vice Chairperson of NITI Aayog enjoys the status of a cabinet-rank minister.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is not a statutory body. It was established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet, not through an act of Parliament.  This means it doesn't derive its authority from a specific law passed by Parliament but from the executive decision of the government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vice Chairperson of NITI Aayog holds a cabinet-rank ministerial position.  This reflects the importance of NITI Aayog's role in national policymaking and planning.  The Vice Chairperson's high-level status ensures their effective participation in government decision-making processes.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2.  No funds can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without parliamentary authorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role, the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget is a collaborative effort involving multiple departments and ministries within the Union government.  The Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in the overall economic framing of the budget.  The final budget is presented to Parliament by the Finance Minister, representing the collective work of various governmental bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without parliamentary authorization. This is a crucial safeguard to ensure financial accountability and transparency in government spending.  Parliament's approval of the budget is essential before any funds can be released from the Consolidated Fund.


**9. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  DPSPs aim to establish a socio-economic democracy by outlining the state's goals for social and economic development.
2.  DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the purpose of the DPSPs.  They serve as guidelines for the state in formulating policies that promote social and economic justice, equality, and welfare.  They aim to create a society that is both socially just and economically equitable, furthering the ideals of a democratic and welfare state.

Statement 2 is also correct. The DPSPs are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  This doesn't mean they are unimportant.  They act as a moral compass for the government and influence policymaking, providing a framework for social and economic progress.  However, their non-justiciable nature distinguishes them from Fundamental Rights, which are directly enforceable in courts.


**10. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha's power concerning Money Bills is limited. While it can discuss and make recommendations on a Money Bill, it cannot amend it. The Lok Sabha (the lower house) has the sole authority to pass Money Bills.  This reflects the principle of financial control vested primarily in the lower house of Parliament.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  These demands, which form part of the budget, are presented and voted upon only in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the Demands for Grants, but it cannot vote on them. This further reinforces the Lok Sabha's primacy in financial matters.


**11. With reference to the Indian Presidential elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  The value of each MLA's vote varies from state to state.
2.  The value of an MP's vote in the Lok Sabha is higher than that of an MP in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The value of an MLA's vote in the Presidential election is determined by a formula that takes into account the state's population.  Larger states have MLAs with higher vote values, reflecting their greater representation in the electoral college. This ensures that states with larger populations have a proportionally greater influence on the outcome of the Presidential election.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The value of a vote for Lok Sabha MPs and Rajya Sabha MPs is calculated using the same formula, which is based on the total population of the country. There is no difference in the value of a vote for an MP from the Lok Sabha compared to the Rajya Sabha.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a state:**

1.  The Governor's emoluments cannot be diminished during his/her term of office.
2.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor during his/her term of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution provides that the emoluments and allowances of a Governor cannot be reduced during their term of office.  This constitutional guarantee ensures the financial security and independence of the Governor, preventing any undue influence on their actions from the central or state government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a Governor enjoys certain immunities, they are not completely immune from legal action.  Criminal proceedings can be initiated against a Governor *after* their term of office expires.  During their tenure, the process to remove a Governor is impeachment by Parliament, not initiation of criminal proceedings.


**13. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill is one introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A private member's bill is any bill introduced in Parliament by a Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a minister.  Government bills, on the other hand, are introduced by ministers on behalf of the government.  This distinction reflects the different origins and purposes of legislation in Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (the upper house) does not have the power to reject a Money Bill. While it can discuss and suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha (the lower house) has the final say on Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to offering recommendations, and the Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject those recommendations.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Parliament can add laws to the Ninth Schedule.
2.  Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to add laws to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. This power was originally intended to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny.  However, the Supreme Court has significantly limited the scope of this protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While initially intended to shield laws from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are not entirely immune from judicial scrutiny. The Court can still examine these laws for their constitutionality, particularly if they violate fundamental rights.  The Supreme Court's decisions have significantly curtailed the effectiveness of the Ninth Schedule as a protection against judicial review.


**15. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission is a single-member body.
2.  The Election Commission resolves disputes related to the mergers or splits of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a single-member body; it is currently a three-member body.  The Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners constitute the ECI.  This structure is designed to ensure impartiality and fairness in the conduct of elections.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India plays a crucial role in resolving disputes arising from mergers or splits within recognized political parties. The ECI's authority in this matter is essential for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and preventing undue manipulation of political parties.  The ECI's decisions in such matters are binding.


**16.  Consider the following statements about the Sarkaria Commission:**

1. The Sarkaria Commission Report recommended a fixed five-year tenure for Governors.
2. The Sarkaria Commission Report recommended that the Governor should invariably insist on the Chief Minister proving his majority on the floor of the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sarkaria Commission, established to examine Centre-State relations, recommended a fixed five-year term for Governors to enhance their independence and impartiality. This was intended to reduce the potential for political interference in the Governor's office.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Sarkaria Commission recommended that in situations of doubt regarding a Chief Minister's majority support, the Governor should insist on a floor test in the state legislature.  This would ensure the Chief Minister's legitimacy and prevent the imposition of an unstable government.  This recommendation aimed at strengthening the democratic process within states.


**17. With reference to the Inter-State Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The Inter-State Council's mandate includes the management of matters in concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction between the Centre and states.
2. The Inter-State Council is a constitutional body established under Article 263.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Inter-State Council plays a crucial role in resolving disputes and coordinating policies between states and the central government, especially on matters falling under the concurrent list. Its role in managing concurrent or overlapping jurisdictions helps prevent conflicts and promotes cooperation between different levels of government.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Inter-State Council is a constitutional body established under Article 263 of the Indian Constitution.  This constitutional basis underscores the importance of inter-state cooperation and dispute resolution in the functioning of India's federal structure. The Council's existence is a testament to the commitment to collaborative governance.


**18. Consider the following statements concerning the powers of the Governor of a state:**

1. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the state legislature for the President's consideration.
2. The Governor has the power to allocate business of the government among various ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President of India. This power acts as a check and balance, ensuring that certain crucial legislative measures are reviewed at the national level before becoming law.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The power to allocate business among ministers within the state government rests with the Chief Minister, not the Governor.  The Governor's role is primarily constitutional, while the Chief Minister is the head of the state's executive branch.  The Chief Minister is responsible for the efficient functioning of the state government.


**19.  With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is responsible for maintaining the accounts of both the central and state governments.
2. The CAG can be removed from office only by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG of India is responsible for auditing the accounts of both the central and state governments.  This ensures accountability and transparency in the use of public funds at all levels of government. The CAG's audit reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CAG holds a highly secure position and can only be removed from office by the President of India, on the basis of a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament.  This process is similar to the impeachment procedure of the President or the removal of Supreme Court judges, demonstrating the importance of maintaining the CAG's independence and integrity.


**20. With reference to the President's rule in a state (Article 356), consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.
2.  The President's rule involves the suspension of fundamental rights in the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's rule under Article 356 does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly. While dissolution is a common consequence, it is not mandatory. The President can choose to keep the assembly in session and allow it to function under the central government's supervision.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The imposition of President's rule in a state does not automatically lead to the suspension of fundamental rights.  Fundamental rights can be suspended only during a national emergency under Article 352, not during President's rule in a state.  The imposition of President's rule is intended to restore normalcy and constitutional governance, not to curtail fundamental rights.


**1. With reference to the powers and functions of the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a three-member body, with the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India can have one, two or three members, depending on the needs.  Currently, it consists of the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners. The number is determined by the President, not fixed by the Constitution.  The Constitution only mandates the appointment of a Chief Election Commissioner, leaving the number of other Election Commissioners to the discretion of the President.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, is the sole authority responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.  The Commission's independence in this matter is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.  The Ministry of Law and Justice's role is primarily limited to legal and administrative matters related to the Election Commission.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The President's rule can be imposed even without the recommendation of the State Governor.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule frequently leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not mandatory. The President can choose to keep the Assembly functioning, though this is rare.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President, based on the circumstances and advice received.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The imposition of President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution requires a report from the Governor of the State.  While the President can act on the basis of other information, the Governor's report is a crucial element.  The Constitution's framers intended this process to be a safeguard against arbitrary imposition.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a rigid division of powers between the Union and the States, with minimal scope for flexibility.
2.  The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature, with the Rajya Sabha representing the States and the Lok Sabha representing the people of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian federal system is a unique blend of federal and unitary features, often described as "quasi-federal."  The division of powers is not entirely rigid; there's considerable flexibility through mechanisms like concurrent lists, emergency provisions, and the Union's power to legislate in the national interest. The flexibility allows the Centre to intervene in matters concerning national unity and security.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament, consisting of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The Rajya Sabha has a representation of the States, while the Lok Sabha represents the people directly. This bicameral structure reflects the federal nature of the government.



**4. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments aim to establish a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj and Municipalities across all states.
2. The Gram Sabha, as per the 73rd Amendment, is the highest decision-making body at the village level, with powers to decide on various development issues.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Amendments aim to establish Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipalities, they don't mandate a uniform three-tier structure across all states. The specific structure can vary based on the state's population and geographical factors. Some states may have a two-tier or even a single-tier structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act explicitly recognizes the Gram Sabha as a vital institution at the village level. The Gram Sabha has significant powers in planning and implementing development projects and resolving local disputes.  It's a crucial element of participatory democracy at the grassroots level.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha can accept or reject the amendments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Private member's bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  While government bills are introduced by ministers, private members (MPs who are not ministers) can also introduce bills.  However, private member bills have a lower chance of passing compared to government bills.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments to a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha has the final say on whether to accept or reject these amendments. The Lok Sabha's power in this regard is crucial because Money Bills primarily deal with financial matters.


**6.  With reference to the Indian Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and the other Ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The President then appoints other Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, forming the Council of Ministers. This reflects the parliamentary system of government.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.  While the Rajya Sabha can scrutinize the government's actions, it cannot bring down the government through a vote of no confidence. This is because the Lok Sabha represents the people directly and holds the government accountable.


**7. With reference to the judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The power of judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India can declare any law or executive order unconstitutional if it violates the basic structure of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The power of judicial review is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. However, it has been established through judicial precedents and interpretations of the Constitution, particularly through the Kesavananda Bharati case, which established the "basic structure" doctrine.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has the power to review laws and executive orders and declare them void if they conflict with the basic structure of the Constitution.  The basic structure doctrine is a significant aspect of judicial review, protecting fundamental aspects of the Constitution from amendment.


**8. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.  They are considered guidelines for the government to strive towards, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  This is a key difference between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to build a welfare state, ensuring social and economic justice for all citizens.  They cover various aspects like providing education, healthcare, and employment, as well as promoting equality and reducing social inequalities.  They are an important part of the Constitution's social justice goals.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The right to constitutional remedies guarantees the right to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are not absolute; they can be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, and other legitimate state interests. The Constitution itself allows for such restrictions.  The balance between individual rights and societal needs is a crucial aspect of constitutional law.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 32 of the Constitution guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  This is a crucial safeguard for protecting fundamental rights against infringement by the state.  The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs to enforce these rights.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble to the Constitution declares India to be a "Socialist Secular Democratic Republic."
2. The word "Secular" was added to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution describes India as a "Socialist Secular Democratic Republic," highlighting its commitment to social and economic justice, secularism, democracy, and republicanism. These are fundamental ideals that shape the Indian nation.

Statement 2 is correct. The words "Socialist" and "Secular" were added to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.  These additions reflected the evolving political and social understanding of the Indian nation.  These additions were made during the Emergency period, signifying the government's commitment to these ideals.


**11. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. The President's choice is usually based on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers, reflecting the existing political dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can remove the Governor at any time, though such removal is unusual and typically occurs only under exceptional circumstances.  The phrase "during the pleasure of the President" reflects the ultimate authority of the President in appointing and removing Governors.


**12. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Union Finance Minister.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill included in the Union Budget.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Union Finance Minister.  This is a crucial event in the Indian parliamentary calendar, outlining the government's financial plans for the coming year.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  While the Rajya Sabha can recommend amendments, the Lok Sabha has the power to accept or reject these recommendations.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in this area is an essential aspect of the parliamentary system's financial procedures.


**13. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch, enabling impartial audits of government accounts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's role is to ensure financial accountability and transparency at all levels of government.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**14. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in PRIs.
2.  The PRIs are empowered to levy and collect taxes, and appropriate the proceeds for local development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and OBCs in PRIs to ensure their representation in local governance.  This is a crucial step in promoting social justice and inclusivity at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is correct. PRIs are empowered to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes and other revenues for local development purposes.  This gives them financial autonomy and enables them to carry out development work effectively. This financial autonomy is essential for their effective functioning.


**15. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act applies to all private organizations.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is responsible for hearing appeals related to the RTI Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act primarily applies to public authorities, not all private organizations.  While some private organizations may choose to comply with the spirit of the RTI Act, it is not legally binding on them.  The Act's focus is on transparency and accountability in government.

Statement 2 is correct. The CIC is the appellate authority for appeals related to the RTI Act at the Central level.  Similarly, State Information Commissions (SICs) handle appeals at the State level.  These commissions play a vital role in ensuring that information is provided to citizens promptly and effectively.


**1. With reference to the Union Territories of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Union Territories are under the direct control and administration of the Centre, unlike states which share power with the Centre.
2.  The executive head of a Union Territory can be an administrator, lieutenant governor, or chief commissioner, unlike states which have a Governor as their constitutional head.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Union Territories, unlike states, do not have the same level of autonomy and power-sharing with the central government. They are directly administered by the Centre. The states, on the other hand, have a federal relationship with the Centre, sharing power as per the constitutional distribution. This difference stems from the historical context of their formation and the need for greater central control in certain areas.

Statement 2 is also correct. The administrative structure of Union Territories differs significantly from that of states. While states have a Governor as their constitutional head, Union Territories may have different executive heads depending on their specific administrative arrangements. This can be an administrator, a lieutenant governor, or a chief commissioner. The designation reflects the varying degrees of autonomy granted to different Union Territories.  The Governor in a state is a constitutional head, while the administrator in a Union Territory is an agent of the President.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the distribution of powers in the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Union List includes subjects like defence, atomic energy, and foreign affairs, while the State List includes subjects like agriculture, police, and public health.
2.  Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State List only under extraordinary circumstances, such as during a national emergency.  Residuary powers, not explicitly mentioned in any list, rest with the Union Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the division of powers between the Union and State governments in India.  The Union List contains subjects of national importance where uniformity is crucial, while the State List deals with matters best handled at the regional level. This division aims to balance national unity with regional autonomy. The Concurrent List allows both the Union and State governments to legislate on certain subjects.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While Parliament can indeed legislate on State List subjects during a national emergency, this is not the only circumstance.  Also, the assertion that residuary powers rest solely with the Union Government is the correct part.  The statement mixes two distinct concepts, creating confusion.  The correct statement is that the Union Government has residuary powers—matters not explicitly mentioned in the Union, State or Concurrent Lists—while the ability to legislate on State List subjects during an emergency is a separate provision.


**3. With reference to the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in all states of India, while the Sixth Schedule deals with tribal areas in four Northeastern states.
2.  The Governor of a state having Scheduled Areas has special responsibilities, including submitting an annual report to the President on their administration, and the President can also declare, alter, or rescind the designation of a Scheduled Area.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule applies to Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in all states *except* Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The Sixth Schedule specifically addresses the administration of tribal areas within these four Northeastern states.  This difference acknowledges the unique historical and cultural context of these regions.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Governor's special role and the President's power concerning Scheduled Areas. The Governor's responsibility highlights the Centre's involvement in the administration of these areas despite the executive power residing primarily with the state. The President's power to declare, modify, or revoke Scheduled Area status emphasizes the central government's oversight in ensuring the welfare of tribal populations.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Federal System:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly uses the term "Federation" to describe the nature of the Indian Union.
2. The Governor of a state plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power between the Centre and the states, including the power to reserve bills passed by the state legislature for the President's assent.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution does *not* explicitly use the term "Federation."  Instead, Article 1 describes India as a "Union of States,"  reflecting a unique blend of federal and unitary features. While the structure exhibits federal elements, the central government holds significant power, creating a system often described as "quasi-federal."

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor's role is a key aspect of Centre-State relations. The Governor's power to reserve bills for the President's assent allows the central government to review and potentially veto state legislation, ensuring national interests are considered. This power, while potentially leading to conflict, is a critical mechanism in the Indian federal system's checks and balances.


**5. With reference to the financial relations between the Union and State Governments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Government primarily controls revenue-generating items such as income tax and customs duties, while the states rely heavily on grants and financial assistance from the Centre.
2. The Finance Commission of India recommends on the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and States and also on the principles to be followed by the Centre while giving grants-in-aid to States but does not recommend on the amount of money to be allocated to the States from the Public Account of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the asymmetrical nature of financial relations in India. The Union Government's control over major revenue sources gives it significant leverage in its dealings with the states.  States depend on central grants and tax-sharing arrangements, leading to potential imbalances and dependence.  This concentration of financial power is a key aspect of the Indian federal system.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Finance Commission, a constitutionally mandated body, plays a crucial role in determining the vertical distribution of resources between the Centre and States. It makes recommendations on the principles guiding grants-in-aid and tax sharing.  However, it does not deal with the Public Account of India, which is a separate account for transactions not related to the Consolidated Fund.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution:**

1. The proclamation of a Financial Emergency by the President can lead to the Parliament assuming the power to make laws on subjects within the jurisdiction of the States.
2.  Article 356 (President's Rule) allows the central government to take over the administration of a state if the Constitutional machinery breaks down, but this power should be exercised sparingly and as a last resort.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The proclamation of a Financial Emergency under Article 360 grants the central government extensive powers, including the ability to legislate on subjects within the State List. This underscores the potential for the Indian federal system to become highly centralized during a financial crisis. This reflects the Constitution's prioritization of national stability over regional autonomy under specific circumstances.

Statement 2 accurately describes Article 356. The power to impose President's Rule is a potent tool for central intervention in state affairs.  However, its misuse has been a source of concern, leading to judicial pronouncements emphasizing its use only as a measure of last resort after exhausting all other options.  The Sarkaria Commission also recommended its sparing use.


**7. With reference to the All-India Services, consider the following statements:**

1. Officers of All-India Services, such as the IAS and IPS, serve in the administration of states but are ultimately under the control of the central government. States cannot take disciplinary action against them without central approval.
2. The All-India Services are created by a constitutional amendment and can be abolished only by a similar process.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the structure and functioning of All-India Services.  These services provide a unified administrative cadre across the country, ensuring consistency and coordination.  However, this also leads to concerns about state autonomy, as the central government retains control over appointments, transfers, and disciplinary actions against these officers.  This is a key aspect of the unitary bias in the Indian federal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The All-India Services were not created by a constitutional amendment. They were established under constitutional provisions, and their abolition would require parliamentary legislation, not necessarily a constitutional amendment.  While the structure is integral to the functioning of the government, it doesn’t hold the same constitutional significance as fundamental rights or other entrenched provisions.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Sarkaria Commission:**

1. The Sarkaria Commission recommended that Article 356 (President's Rule) should be used sparingly and only as a last resort when all other alternatives have failed.
2. The Sarkaria Commission recommended the abolition of All-India Services to enhance state autonomy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the Sarkaria Commission's recommendation on Article 356. The Commission emphasized the need to safeguard state autonomy and prevent the misuse of this powerful provision. It advocated for a more restrained approach, prioritizing negotiation and other measures before resorting to central intervention.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sarkaria Commission did *not* recommend the abolition of All-India Services.  Instead, it suggested strengthening these services to improve administrative efficiency and coordination.  The Commission recognized the value of a unified administrative framework while also advocating for greater state autonomy in other areas.  The commission believed a strong center was essential for national unity and integrity.


**9. With reference to the Punchhi Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Punchhi Commission's terms of reference included examining the role of the Centre and States in managing mega projects like interlinking of rivers, which require long-term coordination and state support.
2. The Punchhi Commission recommended abolishing the Rajya Sabha to address the imbalance of power between the Centre and States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Punchhi Commission's mandate explicitly included reviewing Centre-State relations in the context of large-scale, long-term projects.  The interlinking of rivers is a prime example of a project requiring extensive coordination between the Centre and States over many years.  The commission aimed to provide a framework for such collaborations, balancing national priorities with regional interests.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Punchhi Commission did *not* recommend abolishing the Rajya Sabha.  Instead, it focused on improving its functioning as a representative forum of states, suggesting improvements to its composition and role in Centre-State relations to better reflect federal principles.  The commission aimed at strengthening the federal system, not dismantling its components.




**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India requires prior parliamentary approval before being incurred.
2.  The Parliament's power to vote on demands for grants does not extend to expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India does *not* require prior parliamentary approval. This type of expenditure is non-votable and is automatically charged to the Consolidated Fund based on the Constitution's provisions.  It typically includes salaries of judges, President, Governors, and debt servicing. The Parliament's role is limited to reviewing it, not approving it.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Parliament votes on demands for grants to authorize government expenditure.  However, this process does not apply to expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund.  These charges are obligatory and do not require a vote.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the Parliament's financial powers and the nature of government spending.  The Parliament's control over the budget is not absolute; certain essential expenditures are outside its direct approval process.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes a system of dual citizenship, with separate citizenships at the Union and State levels.
2.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India has a single integrated citizenship;  there is no separate state citizenship. All citizens are citizens of India, regardless of their state of residence. The concept of dual citizenship is not a feature of the Indian federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India appoints the Governors of states.  The crucial point is that they hold office “during the pleasure of the President,” meaning the President can dismiss them at any time. This highlights the Union's influence over state executives within the federal system, even though states have considerable autonomy in other areas.  This power is a significant aspect of the balance between the Union and the States.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Finance Commission:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2.  The Finance Commission is constituted every five years to review the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight and are generally accepted, they are *not* legally binding on the government. The government can choose to accept or reject them, although rejecting them would be politically challenging.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years to examine the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties between the Union and the States and to recommend grants-in-aid to the States from the Consolidated Fund of India. This regular review is crucial for maintaining financial balance in the federal system.  The importance of the Finance Commission lies in its role of mediating financial relations between the Centre and the States, a vital aspect of India's fiscal federalism.


**4. With reference to the President of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The President can promulgate ordinances even when the Parliament is in session.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the President has the formal power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, this power is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister.  This reflects the parliamentary system's conventions and the principle of ministerial responsibility. The President acts as a constitutional head; real executive power rests with the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's power to issue ordinances is generally exercised only when Parliament is not in session. The President cannot promulgate an ordinance while Parliament is in session unless there is a compelling reason and advice from the Council of Ministers.  This restriction prevents the abuse of ordinance-making power.


**5. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha can introduce any bill, including Money Bills.
2.  The Rajya Sabha enjoys equal powers with the Lok Sabha in matters of amending the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot introduce Money Bills.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce Money Bills, reflecting its primary role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha can only review and make recommendations, but it cannot initiate or amend Money Bills.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the Lok Sabha has a dominant role in the legislative process, both Houses have equal powers in constitutional amendments.  This is a significant aspect of India's parliamentary democracy and the balance of power between the two Houses.  The requirement of passage by both Houses ensures that constitutional changes reflect broader consensus.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2. They aim to create a social and economic democracy in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are *not* justiciable; they are not directly enforceable in courts. They are guidelines for the state to strive towards, but courts cannot compel the state to implement them.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state with a focus on social and economic justice. They guide the state's policy in areas like education, healthcare, social security, and economic equality.  They represent the Constitution's commitment to a more equitable society and serve as a moral compass for governance.


**7.  With reference to the CAG of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a fixed term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President for a term of six years, or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier, not 65.  The fixed term and age limit are designed to ensure the CAG's independence and impartiality in auditing government accounts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments. This is a crucial aspect of financial accountability and transparency in India's federal system, ensuring that both levels of government are subject to independent scrutiny.


**8. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time on the advice of the Chief Minister.
2. The Governor can return a bill passed by the State Legislature to the Legislature for reconsideration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Governor formally possesses the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, this power is conventionally exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister. This reflects the principle of ministerial responsibility at the state level.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor has the power to return a bill passed by the State Legislature for reconsideration.  This power allows for a review of the legislation and provides an opportunity for further deliberation before the bill becomes law.  This is a check and balance mechanism within the state legislative process.


**9. Consider the following statements about the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act:**

1. It mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats in proportion to their population.
2. It provides for the establishment of a State Finance Commission to review the financial position of Panchayats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats to ensure their representation in local governance.  This is a key provision aimed at promoting social justice and inclusion at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act also mandates the establishment of a State Finance Commission to examine the financial resources of Panchayats and to recommend measures for their improvement.  This ensures that Panchayats have the financial resources to effectively perform their functions.  This is a critical element in ensuring the effective functioning of the Panchayati Raj system.


**10. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. An ordinance promulgated by the President has the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament.
2. An ordinance must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within six weeks of its promulgation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An ordinance promulgated by the President has the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament, provided it meets the constitutional requirements. This power is intended to allow the executive to act swiftly in emergencies when Parliament is not in session.

Statement 2 is correct.  An ordinance must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within six weeks of its promulgation; otherwise, it lapses. This provision ensures parliamentary oversight and prevents the executive from circumventing the legislative process indefinitely.  This is a crucial check on the executive's emergency powers.



**1. With reference to the administrative structure of Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India has the power to make regulations for the administration of certain Union Territories.
2.  All Union Territories have a legislative assembly and a council of ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 240 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to make regulations for the administration of certain Union Territories, particularly those without a legislature.  This reflects the unitary nature of the Centre's control over these territories.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Not all Union Territories possess a legislative assembly and a council of ministers.  Some Union Territories are administered directly by the central government, while others have varying degrees of legislative autonomy.  The specific administrative structure of a Union Territory is determined by the President based on the unique circumstances of that territory.  The Constitution allows for flexibility in this regard.  The existence of a legislature is not a universal feature of all Union Territories.  Delhi and Puducherry are exceptions, possessing legislative assemblies.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Parliament in relation to State Lists:**

1.  The Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring it to be in the national interest.
2.  Such legislation by the Parliament on State List subjects requires a constitutional amendment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 249 of the Indian Constitution empowers the Rajya Sabha, by a resolution supported by two-thirds of its members present and voting, to authorize Parliament to make laws on subjects within the State List. This provision allows the Centre to intervene in state matters when deemed necessary for the national interest, without requiring a formal constitutional amendment.  This exemplifies the strong centralizing tendencies in the Indian federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The power of Parliament to legislate on State List subjects under Article 249 does *not* require a constitutional amendment.  It operates as a temporary measure, dependent on the continued existence of the Rajya Sabha resolution.  A constitutional amendment is a far more complex and lengthy process.


**3. With reference to the Governor's role in state governments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President and holds office during the President's pleasure.
2.  The Governor has the power to dismiss a state government even if it commands a majority in the state legislative assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governor of a state, and the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This aspect underlines the Centre's influence over state executives.  While the Governor is constitutionally the head of the state, the appointment process demonstrates the central government's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Governor possesses certain discretionary powers, dismissing a state government that enjoys a majority in the legislative assembly would be considered an unconstitutional act.  The Supreme Court has ruled against such actions, emphasizing the principle of responsible government at the state level.  The Governor's powers are subject to judicial review, and arbitrary use of these powers can be challenged in court.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the financial relationship between the Union and State governments:**

1.  The Union List contains most of the revenue-generating subjects.
2.  State governments are entirely independent of Central grants and financial assistance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union List, which outlines the subjects on which the Union government can legislate, includes major revenue-generating areas like income tax, customs duties, and excise.  This gives the Union government a significant financial advantage over the states.  The distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and states is a crucial aspect of Centre-State relations, often leading to disputes and negotiations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. State governments are not financially independent of the Union government. They heavily rely on Central grants and financial assistance for various development projects and schemes.  The dependence on central funds often leads to debates about financial autonomy and equitable resource distribution among the states.  This dependence is a source of both cooperation and conflict in Centre-State relations.


**5. With reference to the Emergency Provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  During a national emergency, the Parliament can make laws on subjects within the State List.
2.  The declaration of a financial emergency automatically leads to the suspension of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 352 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to declare a national emergency. During a national emergency, Parliament's legislative powers extend to subjects in the State List. This is a crucial aspect of the Constitution’s unitary features and allows the Centre to assume greater control during times of crisis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The declaration of a financial emergency under Article 360 does not automatically suspend Fundamental Rights.  While a financial emergency can impact the functioning of state governments, it does not automatically trigger the suspension of fundamental rights, which requires a separate declaration of a national emergency.  Fundamental Rights are protected by the judiciary, and their suspension must adhere to strict constitutional procedures.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the All-India Services:**

1.  Members of the All-India Services are recruited and trained by the Union government.
2.  State governments have the sole authority to take disciplinary action against members of the All-India Services serving within their respective states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) recruits and trains members of the All-India Services such as the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and Indian Forest Service (IFS).  This centralised recruitment process highlights the Union government's control over these crucial services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While state governments can exercise administrative control over All-India Services officers serving within their jurisdiction, the ultimate disciplinary authority rests with the Union government. This aspect of the All-India Services often leads to tension between the Centre and the states, particularly when it comes to the transfer and posting of officers.  The central government maintains significant influence over these officers, even while they function within state administrations.


**7. With reference to the Inter-State Council, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Inter-State Council was established on the recommendation of the Sarkaria Commission.
2.  The Inter-State Council is a constitutional body established under Article 263.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sarkaria Commission, established to review Centre-State relations, recommended the establishment of a permanent Inter-State Council to address inter-state disputes and foster cooperation.  This recommendation was implemented, leading to the formation of the Inter-State Council.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Inter-State Council is indeed a constitutional body established under Article 263 of the Indian Constitution.  This article empowers the President to establish an Inter-State Council to investigate and make recommendations on disputes involving two or more states or between the Centre and the states.  This illustrates the constitutional framework for addressing inter-state issues.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha represents the states of the Indian federation.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in financial matters.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, represents the states of the Indian Union.  Each state is allocated a certain number of seats based on its population, ensuring state-level representation in the legislative process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have equal powers with the Lok Sabha in financial matters.  The Lok Sabha, being the House of the People, holds greater power in financial matters, including the power to vote on demands for grants and the budget.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay financial bills, not reject them.  This difference in power reflects the principle of popular sovereignty and the Lok Sabha's greater accountability to the electorate.


**9. With reference to the distribution of powers between the Union and the States in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The residuary powers vest with the Union Government.
2.  There is a uniform administrative setup in all the states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution vests residuary powers—that is, powers not explicitly assigned to either the Union or the States—with the Union government.  This is a key aspect that contributes to the strong centralizing tendency of the Indian federal system.  This power allows the Centre to address unforeseen or new areas of governance without requiring constitutional amendments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. There is not a uniform administrative setup across all states in India.  While some aspects of administration might be broadly similar, states have considerable autonomy in designing their administrative structures and procedures.  The diversity of administrative practices across different states reflects the federal nature of the Indian system, allowing for adaptation to local needs and contexts.  The central government provides a framework but states have leeway in implementation.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are enforceable by courts.
2. They aim to establish a socio-economic democracy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, are not legally enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards, providing a socio-economic framework for governance.  The non-justiciable nature of these principles allows for flexibility in their interpretation and implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy, ensuring social justice and economic equality. They lay out a vision for a welfare state, guiding the government's policies towards improving the lives of its citizens.  This vision is a fundamental aspect of the Indian Constitution's commitment to social justice and economic progress.  They provide a framework for policies designed to reduce inequality and improve the living standards of the population.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for the delimitation of constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and, currently, two other Election Commissioners. The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the government as needed, however, the minimum number of Election Commissioners is one (the Chief Election Commissioner).  The ECI is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The delimitation of constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies is the responsibility of the Delimitation Commission, not the Election Commission.  While the ECI oversees the electoral process within the defined constituencies, the actual defining of those constituencies is a separate process undertaken by the Delimitation Commission, which is constituted by the government under the Delimitation Act.  The ECI's role is limited to conducting elections within the boundaries established by the Delimitation Commission.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the division of powers between the ECI and other constitutional bodies.


**2. With reference to President's Rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can impose President's Rule in a State only on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet.
2.  President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The imposition of President's Rule, or Article 356 of the Indian Constitution,  is a significant power that can only be exercised by the President based on a report from the Governor of the State and after receiving advice from the Union Council of Ministers. It's not a unilateral action by the President; it requires the involvement of the Union Cabinet and the Governor's report indicating a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state.  The process safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensures collective responsibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While President's Rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic.  The President may choose to keep the Assembly in place or dissolve it, depending on the circumstances. The decision rests with the President, acting on the advice of the Union Cabinet, and is based on a holistic assessment of the situation in the state.  This flexibility allows for different responses to varying degrees of constitutional breakdown.


**3. With reference to Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system with a strong central government.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India is based on a rigid division of powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indian federal system is often described as "quasi-federal" or "unitary with federal features" due to the significant powers vested in the central government. While the Constitution does delineate powers between the Centre and States, the central government possesses greater influence and authority in several areas, including emergency powers and the ability to legislate on state subjects under certain circumstances.  This makes it different from a purely federal system where states have more autonomy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India is not based on a rigid division. The Constitution employs a flexible system with provisions like the Concurrent List, where both the Centre and the States can legislate, and the residual powers that reside with the Centre.  The system allows for adaptation and modification depending on national needs, unlike a rigid system where powers are strictly defined and cannot be altered easily. This flexibility is a key characteristic of the Indian federal structure.


**4. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, has limited powers regarding Money Bills.  A Money Bill, which primarily concerns financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (lower house).  The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments. However, the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations. The Lok Sabha's decision on the Money Bill is final. This structure prioritizes the Lok Sabha's role in financial matters, reflecting the principle of popular sovereignty.


**5. With reference to the Indian Judicial System, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India can review its own judgments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court of India exercises the power of judicial review (the power to declare laws unconstitutional), this power is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. It has been established through judicial precedent and interpretation of various constitutional provisions.  The power of judicial review is implied, not explicitly stated.  This is a key aspect of the Indian constitutional framework, demonstrating the judiciary's evolving role in constitutional interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, enabling it to review its own judgments. This can occur in subsequent cases where similar issues arise, allowing the Court to refine its legal interpretation and ensure consistency in its decisions.  This power reflects the Supreme Court's commitment to evolving legal principles and ensuring justice.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2. The Directive Principles are meant to provide a socio-economic framework for the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in a court of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to follow when formulating policies and laws aimed at achieving social and economic justice. While the courts may consider DPSPs when interpreting laws, they cannot directly order the state to implement them.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs lay out the socio-economic goals that the Indian state should strive to achieve. They aim to create a society where social and economic justice prevails, and citizens have access to basic necessities like education, healthcare, and employment.  They represent the aspirational side of the Constitution, guiding the state towards a more equitable society.


**7. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of all persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) does mandate the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels. However, it doesn't mandate a strict three-tier structure in every state. The specific structure of PRIs can vary depending on the state's population and geographical characteristics. Some states may have a two-tier system, while others might have more tiers.  The amendment provides a framework, allowing flexibility for states to adapt it to their circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gram Sabha, as defined by the 73rd Amendment, is a body comprising all the registered voters residing in a village. It plays a crucial role in local governance and is involved in planning and implementation of development programs at the village level.  Its composition is clearly defined in the constitutional amendment, making it a key component of the PRI system.


**8. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The right to education is a Fundamental Right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India. However, the Supreme Court of India, in several landmark judgments, has recognized the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21).  This demonstrates the judiciary's role in interpreting and expanding the scope of fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, has made the right to free and compulsory education a Fundamental Right for all children aged 6 to 14 years. This right is enshrined under Article 21A of the Constitution, which was added through the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act in 2002.  The RTE Act operationalizes this right, ensuring its effective implementation.  The inclusion of this right reflects India's commitment to human development.


**9.  With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Union Budget includes both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha (Lower House) by the Finance Minister. Only after the Lok Sabha has considered it, can it be presented to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House). While both houses must approve the budget, the Lok Sabha's role is primary in this process. This reflects the Lok Sabha's position as the house of the people, directly elected by citizens.


Statement 2 is correct. The Union Budget encompasses two major components: the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget. The Revenue Budget deals with the government's revenue receipts (taxes, etc.) and expenditure (salaries, subsidies, etc.). The Capital Budget deals with capital receipts (borrowings, etc.) and expenditure (infrastructure projects, etc.). Both are essential parts of the annual financial statement presented to Parliament.



**10. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  The President appoints the Governor based on advice from the Union Council of Ministers.  This process ensures that the appointment of the Governor is not arbitrary but a considered decision within the government.


The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, although this power is rarely exercised.  This provision ensures a balance of power and allows for the removal of a Governor who is not performing their duties satisfactorily.  However, the convention is that the Governor is not dismissed unless there are serious reasons.


**1. With reference to the qualifications of judges of State High Courts, consider the following statements:**

1. A person should have been a judge of a High Court for at least five years to be eligible for appointment as a Chief Justice of a High Court.
2.  A person should have been an advocate of a High Court for at least ten years to be eligible for appointment as a judge of a High Court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While experience as a High Court judge is a common factor in appointments to Chief Justice positions, there's no constitutional mandate specifying a minimum of five years.  The President appoints the Chief Justice of a High Court based on several factors, including seniority, merit, and judicial experience.  The five-year requirement is not a rigid criterion.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 217 of the Indian Constitution outlines the qualifications for appointment as a judge of a High Court.  One of these is that the person must have been an advocate of a High Court for at least 10 years. This is a fundamental and explicitly stated requirement.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding "Residuary Powers":**

1. Residuary powers are those powers that are not explicitly assigned to either the Union or the States in the Constitution.
2.  In the Indian federal system, residuary powers vest with the States, allowing them to legislate on matters not covered in the Union or Concurrent Lists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Residuary powers, by definition, are those powers that remain after the distribution of powers between the Union and the States has been completed.  The Constitution explicitly lists powers for the Union and Concurrent Lists; anything not explicitly mentioned falls under the residuary category.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In the Indian Constitution, Article 248 vests residuary powers with the Parliament (Union), not the States.  This reflects the strong centralizing tendency of the Indian federal structure.  The States have powers specifically enumerated in the State List, but the residual authority remains with the Union government.


**3. With reference to the functions of the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Attorney General is a member of both Houses of Parliament and enjoys the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of both houses but without a right to vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 76 of the Constitution details the appointment and tenure of the Attorney General.  The President appoints the Attorney General, and the office is held during the President's pleasure—meaning the Attorney General can be removed at any time by the President.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Attorney General has the right to speak and participate in parliamentary debates, they are not a member of either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.  Their role is primarily advisory to the government and representing the government in legal matters before courts. They do not have voting rights in Parliament.


**4. With reference to the meaning of "Point of Order", consider the following statements:**

1. A point of order is raised by a member of Parliament to challenge the conduct of the proceedings of the House, if it violates the rules of procedure.
2.  A point of order can only be raised by a member of the ruling party to maintain order and decorum in the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A point of order is a parliamentary procedure used to bring to the Speaker's attention any violation of the rules of procedure or conduct during a session. This is a crucial tool for maintaining order and ensuring the smooth functioning of the House.  Any member, regardless of party affiliation, can raise a point of order.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The right to raise a point of order is not restricted to members of the ruling party.  It's a fundamental right of any member of the House to ensure that proceedings adhere to the established rules and regulations.  The aim is to maintain order and fairness, not to favor any particular party.


**5. With reference to the functions of the Zonal Councils, consider the following statements:**

1. Zonal Councils are established under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, to promote cooperation and coordination among states within a zone.
2. The Zonal Councils primarily focus on resolving interstate disputes related to water resources, boundary demarcation and revenue sharing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Zonal Councils were established to foster cooperation and coordination among states within geographical zones in India.  They provide a platform for discussing common issues and resolving inter-state disagreements amicably.  The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 laid the groundwork for their formation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Zonal Councils can certainly help in resolving interstate disputes, their functions are broader than just water resources, boundaries, and revenue sharing.  They address a wide range of issues, including infrastructure development, economic planning, social welfare schemes, and overall inter-state cooperation on various matters of mutual concern.  The primary focus is on promoting coordination, not solely conflict resolution.


**6. With reference to the "first-past-the-post" system, consider the following statements:**

1. In the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who secures the highest number of votes in a constituency is declared elected, regardless of whether they secure an absolute majority.
2. The first-past-the-post system is used for electing members to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, also known as the simple plurality system, is characterized by the fact that the candidate with the most votes wins, even if they don't have a majority of the votes cast.  This means a candidate can win with a relatively small share of the total votes if the other candidates' votes are spread out among them.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's electoral system for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies employs the FPTP system.  Each constituency elects a single representative, and the candidate with the most votes wins.  This system is simple to understand and administer but has been criticized for its potential to underrepresent smaller parties and create disproportionate results.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding "Money Bill":**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament; however, it must be passed by both houses with a special majority.
2.  A Money Bill primarily deals with matters relating to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and not in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House). While it needs the Rajya Sabha's assent, the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only return it to the Lok Sabha with recommendations, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.  The Lok Sabha's decision is final.

Statement 2 is correct.  A Money Bill primarily deals with financial matters such as taxation, borrowing, expenditure, and other financial provisions for the government.  It's a crucial aspect of the budget process and legislative control over government finances. The definition of a Money Bill is provided in Article 110 of the Constitution.


**8. With reference to the Doctrine of "Colourable Legislation", consider the following statements:**

1. The doctrine of colourable legislation applies when a law is enacted by the legislature ostensibly for a particular purpose but actually for a different purpose which is beyond the legislature's competence.
2. If a law is found to be colourable legislation by the courts, it is declared ultra vires and void.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The doctrine of colourable legislation is a judicial principle used to check the legislative power of the government.  It applies when a legislature tries to achieve an objective that is outside its constitutional powers by disguising it under a seemingly legitimate purpose.  The court looks beyond the stated purpose to the actual intent and effect of the legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. If a court finds a law to be colourable legislation—meaning it's a disguised attempt to exercise power beyond the legislature's competence—it can declare the law ultra vires (beyond its power) and therefore void.  This is a significant check on the potential for legislative overreach.


**9. With reference to Public Bill and Private Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A public bill is introduced by a private member of Parliament, while a private bill is introduced by a minister.
2. A private bill primarily affects a specific individual or group, whereas a public bill is of general public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A public bill is introduced by a minister or a member of the government, while a private member's bill is introduced by a private member of Parliament (i.e., a Member of Parliament who is not a minister).  The distinction lies in the initiator of the bill, not its scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  Private bills deal with matters of specific or private interest, affecting a particular individual, group, or organization.  Public bills, on the other hand, address matters of general public interest and concern, impacting the entire nation or a significant segment of the population.  This is the fundamental distinction between the two types of bills.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a constitutionally mandated body, established under Part XV of the Constitution.
2.  The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India's existence is rooted in the Constitution, specifically Part XV, which deals with elections.  It's not a body created by a simple act of Parliament; its constitutional foundation ensures its independence and authority.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President of India appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners. This appointment process, while involving the government, is designed to ensure a degree of independence from direct political influence. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, but the ultimate appointment rests with the President.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, blending elements of both federal and unitary features.
2.  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India and acts as the nominal head of the state government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's federal system isn't strictly federal like the US or Canada.  It incorporates features of a unitary system, including a strong central government with significant powers and the ability to override state governments in certain circumstances (like the imposition of President's Rule under Article 356).  The flexibility built into the Indian system allows the center to intervene more directly than in many strictly federal systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. While the Governor plays a significant ceremonial role, they also hold certain powers, such as the power to dissolve the state legislative assembly and to reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President.  This arrangement reflects the balance between federal and unitary aspects within the Indian system. The Governor's position reinforces the center's influence over the states.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Parliament of India:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a special majority.
2.  The Parliament has the power to legislate on any subject in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring it to be in the national interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution allows for amendments to any part of itself, including the Fundamental Rights. However, this requires a special majority, typically a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament and ratification by half of the states. This process is laid out in Article 368 of the Constitution.  The power to amend reflects the Parliament's ultimate authority in shaping the legal framework of the nation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  This power is derived from Article 249 of the Constitution. This allows the Rajya Sabha, representing the states, to grant the Parliament the power to make laws on subjects that are normally within the purview of the state legislatures when it deems such laws to be in the national interest.  This mechanism demonstrates the flexibility within the Indian federal system, allowing for national priorities to override state concerns in specific instances.


**4. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in India and has original jurisdiction in certain matters.
2.  The Chief Justice of India is appointed by the President of India, and the other judges are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India sits at the apex of the Indian judicial system. It hears appeals from High Courts and has original jurisdiction in specific cases, such as disputes between the Union and the States or between States.  This establishes the Supreme Court's role in ensuring the uniform application of laws and the upholding of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The President appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI).  Subsequently, the President appoints other Supreme Court judges in consultation with the CJI and other senior judges.  This collegiate approach aims to ensure judicial independence and the appointment of individuals with the necessary qualifications and experience.  This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and impartiality of the Supreme Court.


**5. Consider the following statements about the President of India:**

1. The President of India is elected indirectly by an electoral college consisting of elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of the States.
2. The President can be removed from office through impeachment by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India isn't directly elected by the people. Instead, an electoral college composed of elected members of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and state legislative assemblies elects the President. This indirect election method is designed to ensure that the President is chosen by representatives of the people at both the national and state levels.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution provides for the removal of the President through impeachment for violation of the Constitution. This process requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament, reflecting the seriousness of such an action.  This provision safeguards against potential abuse of power by the President and upholds the rule of law.


**6. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning that their violation can be challenged in a court of law.
2.  Some Fundamental Rights can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The essence of Fundamental Rights is that they are enforceable.  Citizens can approach the courts to seek redress if these rights are violated.  This justiciability is a cornerstone of the protection afforded by these rights.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Constitution allows for the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency, declared under Article 352.  However, this suspension is not absolute, and certain rights, such as the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21), cannot be entirely suspended.  This emergency provision reflects a balance between national security concerns and the protection of individual rights.  The suspension is temporary and subject to review.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts.
2.  They aim to establish a welfare state by outlining social and economic goals for the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable in courts.  They represent aspirational goals for the state, guiding its policies but not creating legally binding obligations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Directive Principles aim to build a welfare state by providing guidelines for the government to pursue social and economic justice, including providing education, healthcare, and other social benefits.  They represent the social and economic vision of the Constitution-makers.  While not directly enforceable, they are meant to influence the government's actions and shape public policy.


**8. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Part XIV of the Constitution.
2. The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to various All-India Services and Central Services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC's existence is rooted in the Constitution itself, specifically Part XIV, which deals with the Union Public Service Commission and the State Public Service Commissions. This constitutional basis ensures its independence and authority in recruitment matters.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The UPSC's primary function is to conduct examinations and recommend suitable candidates for appointment to various All-India Services (like the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service) and Central Services. This role is essential for maintaining meritocracy and impartiality in the recruitment process for crucial government positions.  The UPSC acts as a safeguard against political patronage and ensures that individuals are selected based on their merit.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General of India is the highest law officer of the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India appoints the Attorney General.  This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The process aims to ensure that the Attorney General is a person of impeccable legal standing and experience.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Attorney General is the highest law officer of India, providing legal advice to the government. They represent the government in the Supreme Court and other courts, and they have a significant role in the legal affairs of the nation.  Their position ensures that the government receives expert legal counsel on matters of national importance.


**10. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay, but not reject, a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Money Bills, which deal with matters related to taxation and government spending, can only originate in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater representational capacity and its direct accountability to the electorate.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Rajya Sabha can review and suggest amendments to a Money Bill, it cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha's power is limited to suggesting amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill, and the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these suggestions.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.  This arrangement ensures that the lower house retains primary control over the nation's financial affairs.



**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India appoints the Governor of a State.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning that the President can remove the Governor at any time. This arrangement underscores the Union's ultimate authority over the states.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor has significant powers related to the State Legislature. They can summon (call into session), prorogue (suspend), and dissolve (end) the State Legislative Assembly.  These powers are essential for maintaining the smooth functioning of the state government and for ensuring that the legislature remains accountable to the executive.  However, the Governor usually exercises these powers on the advice of the State Council of Ministers.


**12. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  The Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act, enacted in 1992, introduced a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj at the village, intermediate (block or taluka), and district levels.  This structure aims to decentralize power and bring governance closer to the people at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and women in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to ensure their adequate representation in local governance. This reservation policy aims to address historical inequalities and empower marginalized communities.  The specific percentage of reservation varies depending on the state and the level of the PRI.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act:**

1. The RTI Act empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities.
2.  The Central Information Commission is responsible for enforcing the RTI Act at the national level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RTI Act is designed to promote transparency and accountability in government.  It provides citizens with a legal right to seek information from public authorities, subject to certain exemptions.  This empowerment helps to hold public officials accountable and ensures greater government responsiveness.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a statutory body established under the RTI Act to oversee its implementation at the national level. The CIC investigates complaints regarding denial of information and can direct public authorities to provide information.   The CIC plays a vital role in ensuring that the RTI Act is effective in practice.  State Information Commissions exist at the state level to perform a similar function.


**14. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a specialized environmental court with the power to adjudicate environmental disputes.
2.  The NGT's jurisdiction extends to cases related to environmental protection and conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NGT is a specialized tribunal established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  It is designed to provide a faster and more efficient mechanism for resolving environmental disputes, reducing the burden on higher courts.  The NGT's establishment reflects a commitment to environmental justice.

Statement 2 is also correct. The NGT has a broad jurisdiction encompassing various environmental matters, including cases related to pollution, conservation of forests and other natural resources, and the enforcement of environmental laws.  It's a crucial institution for upholding environmental protection in India.  The NGT's decisions can have significant implications for environmental policy and practice.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India. This appointment process aims to ensure the CAG's independence from political influence.  The CAG's independence is vital for maintaining the integrity of the audit process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG's role extends to auditing the accounts of both the Union and State governments.  They examine government expenditure to ensure its legality and propriety, acting as a guardian of public funds and promoting financial accountability.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary scrutiny and public oversight of government spending.  The CAG's role is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in public finances.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, contrasting with the 'police state' model prevalent during the colonial era.
2.  The Constitution explicitly mandates the state's duty to apply these principles when making laws, despite their non-justiciable nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are a key element of the Indian Constitution, reflecting the vision of a welfare state where the government actively works towards the well-being of its citizens. This contrasts sharply with the "police state" model of the colonial era, which prioritized maintaining order and control over social welfare.  The DPSPs outline a social and economic program aimed at achieving social justice, equality, and fraternity, as enshrined in the Preamble. The concept of a welfare state, where the government plays a proactive role in ensuring the welfare of its citizens, is central to the DPSPs.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the DPSPs are non-justiciable (not directly enforceable in court), Article 37 of the Constitution explicitly states that they are "fundamental in the governance of the country," and it is the duty of the State to apply them in making laws.  This means that while courts cannot compel the government to implement DPSPs, they are expected to consider them when formulating and enacting laws.  The government's actions and policies are expected to reflect the spirit and intent of these principles, even if they are not legally binding.  Therefore, the constitutional provision itself emphasizes the importance of the DPSPs in guiding the state's legislative and executive functions.


**2. With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution introduced a list of Fundamental Duties, but these duties are not legally enforceable.
2. The Constitution explicitly links the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights to the fulfillment of Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment (1976) added Part IVA to the Constitution, encompassing Fundamental Duties.  These duties, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not legally enforceable. They are aspirational in nature, aiming to promote a sense of national unity, social responsibility, and respect for the Constitution.  While there are no legal consequences for not fulfilling these duties, they are morally binding on citizens and serve as guiding principles for ethical conduct.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution does *not* make the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights dependent on the fulfillment of Fundamental Duties.  While the inclusion of Fundamental Duties aimed to foster a sense of responsibility among citizens, it did not alter the status of Fundamental Rights as legally protected and enforceable.  Fundamental Rights remain independent and can be claimed irrespective of whether a citizen has fulfilled their Fundamental Duties. There's no legal linkage between the two.


**3. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The principle of "Equal pay for equal work for both men and women" was added to the DPSP by the 42nd Amendment.
2.  The DPSPs constitute limitations only upon the executive function of the government, not the legislative function.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, enacted in 1976, incorporated several significant changes, including the addition of the principle of "equal pay for equal work for both men and women" to the Directive Principles of State Policy. This principle reflects the commitment to gender equality and fair compensation in the workplace.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) aim to guide the government's actions in both legislative and executive spheres.  While they are not judicially enforceable, they serve as guidelines for formulating laws and policies, influencing both the legislative and executive branches. The DPSPs act as a check on both legislative and executive powers by setting out social and economic goals that the government should strive to achieve.  The courts, while not directly enforcing DPSPs, may consider them when evaluating the reasonableness of laws under other constitutional provisions, indirectly influencing both legislative and executive functions.


**4. With reference to the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Rights primarily protect individual rights, while Directive Principles aim to ensure the well-being of society as a whole.
2.  The government's attempt to implement DPSPs can sometimes conflict with Fundamental Rights, as seen in the debates surrounding the abolition of the Zamindari system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fundamental Rights, enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, primarily focus on protecting the individual liberties and freedoms of citizens against state encroachment.  These are justiciable rights, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.  In contrast, Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), in Part IV, outline social and economic goals that the state should strive to achieve for the overall betterment of society.  These are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts. The difference in their nature highlights a fundamental tension in constitutional design—balancing individual liberties with societal well-being.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The historical context of the abolition of the Zamindari system in India demonstrates a clear conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.  The government's efforts to implement DPSPs related to land reforms and equitable distribution of resources clashed with the then-existing Fundamental Right to property.  This led to extensive legal battles and ultimately to the amendment of the Constitution, reflecting the complex interplay between individual rights and societal goals. The case demonstrates the challenges of balancing individual liberties with the broader objectives of social and economic justice.  The government's actions to implement DPSPs, even if well-intentioned, can sometimes infringe upon individual rights, highlighting the need for careful consideration and balancing in policy-making.


**5. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to livelihood and shelter.
2.  Preventive detention, while seemingly at odds with Article 21, is constitutionally permissible but subject to specific safeguards and limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has significantly expanded the scope of Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  Through various landmark judgments, the court has interpreted this right to encompass not merely the absence of physical harm but also the right to a life of dignity, including essential necessities like livelihood and shelter.  The court's expansive interpretation of Article 21 reflects its commitment to ensuring fundamental human rights and social justice.  Denying someone the means to survive—livelihood and shelter—is seen as a violation of their right to life itself.


Statement 2 is also correct.  Preventive detention, the imprisonment of individuals without trial based on the apprehension of future unlawful activity, appears to contradict the fundamental right to personal liberty (Article 21). However, the Constitution does allow for preventive detention under certain circumstances, recognizing the state's need to maintain public order and national security.  However, this power is not absolute and is subject to strict limitations and safeguards, such as the requirement of bringing the case before an advisory board for review after a certain period.  The balance between national security and individual liberty is a complex issue, and the constitutional provisions regarding preventive detention reflect this tension. The existence of safeguards highlights the constitutional commitment to protecting individual rights even within the context of national security concerns.



**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a five-member body, ensuring a broad representation of diverse perspectives in election management.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is *not* a five-member body. It is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and can have up to two other Election Commissioners. This structure is designed to ensure impartiality and efficiency in election management. The number of Election Commissioners, while potentially up to two, is not fixed at five.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does *not* decide the election schedule.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) itself is constitutionally empowered to determine the schedule for all elections, including general and by-elections. This independent power is crucial for ensuring the impartiality and fairness of the electoral process.  The ECI's autonomy in setting election schedules is a cornerstone of its independence and ability to conduct free and fair elections.


**7. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill.
2.  The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants included in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does *not* have the power to reject a Money Bill.  Money Bills, dealing with matters of taxation, borrowing, and expenditure, are exclusively within the domain of the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations on a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept them.  This asymmetrical power distribution ensures the Lok Sabha's primacy in financial matters. The Rajya Sabha's limited role reflects the principle of popular sovereignty, emphasizing the elected Lok Sabha's greater accountability to the people in financial decision-making.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha does *not* have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  Demands for Grants are part of the Union Budget, and the Rajya Sabha can only discuss and make recommendations on these demands but cannot vote on them.  The Lok Sabha holds the sole power to approve or reject the Demands for Grants, reflecting its role as the body directly elected by the people.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily advisory in this context, ensuring scrutiny but not direct control over the allocation of public funds.  This division of powers reflects a balance between legislative review and financial accountability.



**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The "ideal of a Welfare State" is enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are legally enforceable in courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the Preamble doesn't explicitly use the term "Welfare State," its commitment to securing social, economic, and political justice, liberty, and equality implicitly reflects the core values of a welfare state.  The overall aim of the Constitution, as evident in the Preamble and its various parts, is to establish a society where the state actively works towards the well-being of its citizens.  The Preamble sets the tone for the entire constitutional framework, which includes provisions for both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, both contributing to the establishment of a welfare state.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are *not* legally enforceable in courts. They are considered non-justiciable, meaning they do not create legally enforceable rights.  They serve as guiding principles for the state in formulating laws and policies to promote social and economic justice, but they cannot be used to directly challenge government actions in court.  The non-justiciable nature of the DPSPs reflects the constitutional balance between individual rights and societal goals.  While the DPSPs inspire and guide state action, the Constitution prioritizes the enforceability of Fundamental Rights.  This distinction reflects a pragmatic approach to constitutional law, acknowledging the limitations of judicial intervention in social and economic policy.


**9. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A Bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses upon its prorogation.
2. A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Bill pending in the Lok Sabha (House of the People) lapses automatically when the Lok Sabha is prorogued (adjourned indefinitely).  This means that if a Bill has not been passed by the Lok Sabha before its prorogation, it needs to be reintroduced in a new session.  This procedural rule ensures that legislative business is conducted efficiently and prevents bills from lingering indefinitely.  The requirement of reintroduction in a new session allows for further debate, consideration of any amendments, and ultimately, a fresh vote.


Statement 2 is also correct. A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) that has not yet been passed by the Lok Sabha does *not* lapse simply because the Lok Sabha is dissolved.  The dissolution of the Lok Sabha does not affect the legislative process in the Rajya Sabha.  The Bill remains alive and can be considered by the newly elected Lok Sabha after it is constituted.  This provision ensures continuity in the legislative process and prevents the loss of legislative work due to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  The distinct lifecycles of Bills in the two Houses reflect the bicameral nature of the Indian Parliament.



**10. With reference to the "Office of Profit," consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, exempts certain posts from disqualification on grounds of holding an "Office of Profit."
2.  The Constitution of India provides a precise and exhaustive definition of what constitutes an "Office of Profit."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, was enacted to address the issue of "Office of Profit," which can lead to disqualification of members of Parliament and state legislatures.  The Act specifies certain posts that are exempted from the disqualification provisions, acknowledging the need for some public office holders to also be members of the legislature.  The Act aims to strike a balance between preventing undue influence and allowing participation of individuals holding certain positions in the legislative process.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* provide a precise and exhaustive definition of "Office of Profit."  The concept is inherently ambiguous, and determining whether a particular office constitutes an "Office of Profit" often requires interpretation and judicial scrutiny.  This ambiguity has been a source of controversy and legal challenges over the years.  The lack of a precise definition reflects the complexities of balancing the need to prevent conflicts of interest with the practical realities of political representation.  The courts have had to play a significant role in interpreting this concept, leading to varying interpretations over time.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by ensuring social and economic justice,  promoting the welfare of the people, and achieving a socioeconomic democracy.
2.  The enforcement of Directive Principles is not justiciable; they are not legally enforceable by courts, but their implementation is a moral and political obligation of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the nature and purpose of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in the Indian Constitution.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the overarching goal of DPSPs: to create a welfare state characterized by social and economic justice, aiming for a socioeconomic democracy that goes beyond mere political democracy.  The DPSPs outline various socio-economic goals like raising the standard of living, equitable distribution of resources, and providing adequate livelihoods. Statement 2 is also correct in asserting the non-justiciable nature of DPSPs.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, they cannot be directly enforced through court orders.  However, they are fundamental in the governance of the country and serve as guiding principles for the state's legislative and executive actions. The government is morally and politically accountable for their implementation, though not legally compelled by the judiciary.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual aspects of DPSPs: their aspirational socio-economic goals and their non-justiciable nature.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to reject Money Bills but can suggest amendments which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss the Annual Financial Statement and vote on the Demands for Grants, but its approval is not mandatory for the passage of the budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect regarding the Rajya Sabha's financial powers. The Rajya Sabha, being the upper house, cannot reject Money Bills.  It can only recommend amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill; the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these recommendations, but the Rajya Sabha's consent is not binding.  Statement 1 incorrectly states that the Rajya Sabha can reject Money Bills.  Statement 2 is also inaccurate. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants; this power exclusively rests with the Lok Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can discuss the Annual Financial Statement, its approval is not necessary for the budget's passage.  Only the Lok Sabha's approval is necessary for the budget's passage. Therefore, neither statement accurately portrays the Rajya Sabha's limited but significant role in financial matters.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act primarily focused on establishing a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature, enhancing the independence of the judicial branch.
2. The Act aimed to clearly define the jurisdictional boundaries and responsibilities between the central and provincial governments, leading to a more organized distribution of powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 (also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms) did not primarily focus on separating the judiciary and the legislature. While some reforms might have indirectly impacted the judicial system, the primary focus was on expanding legislative councils and introducing dyarchy (dual governance) in provinces. Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the 1919 Act was the devolution of legislative authority, aiming to delineate the powers and responsibilities between the central and provincial governments.  This was a significant step towards greater provincial autonomy, albeit within a framework still dominated by the central government. The Act introduced dyarchy in provinces, dividing subjects into 'transferred' (provincial) and 'reserved' (central) categories, thus attempting a more defined distribution of governmental power.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a central aspect of the 1919 Act.


**4. With reference to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  When a bill is referred to a joint sitting, it requires a three-fourths majority of members present and voting for its passage.
2. A joint sitting can be convened only for resolving a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on ordinary legislation and not on Money Bills or Constitutional Amendment Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is wrong because a joint sitting requires only a simple majority of members present and voting for the passage of a bill, not a three-fourths majority.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. A joint sitting can be convened to resolve deadlocks on ordinary legislation, but it is also applicable to Constitutional Amendment Bills.  However, it is crucial to remember that a joint sitting cannot be convened for Money Bills, as the Constitution explicitly excludes them from this process.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is maintained even in cases of disagreement. Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the rules governing joint sittings of Parliament.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1.  NITI Aayog replaced the Finance Commission as the primary body for advising the government on financial matters and resource allocation.
2. NITI Aayog's primary function is to formulate the Five-Year Plans, similar to its predecessor, the Planning Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, not the Finance Commission. The Finance Commission continues to be responsible for making recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and State governments.  NITI Aayog does not formulate Five-Year Plans.  While it advises the government on development strategies, its role is more focused on fostering cooperative federalism, promoting innovation, and providing a platform for collaborative policy-making. The emphasis has shifted from centrally planned Five-Year Plans to a more flexible and participatory approach to national development.  Therefore, both statements misrepresent the role and function of NITI Aayog.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Executive Power of the Union of India:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union of India is vested in the President, who exercises it directly or through officers subordinate to him/her.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board, responsible for overseeing the administration of the civil services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. According to Article 53 of the Indian Constitution, the executive power of the Union is vested in the President.  However, it's important to note that the President exercises this power through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, adhering to the principles of parliamentary democracy. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not the ex officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board. The Civil Services Board is a statutory body and not directly related to the Prime Minister's office. The composition and functioning of the Board are determined by the government.  Therefore, only statement 1 is a correct description of executive power in the Indian Union.


**7. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals exclusively with the administration of Scheduled Tribes in the border states of India, focusing on their protection and welfare.
2. The Sixth Schedule outlines the provisions for the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, granting them a degree of autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in various states, not just border states.  It provides for the establishment of tribal advisory councils and grants the Governor special powers to protect and promote the interests of Scheduled Tribes in these areas. The focus is broader than just border states. Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides for the administration of tribal areas in four states of Northeast India: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils with significant powers in matters of local governance, taxation, and land administration, thereby granting these tribal areas a considerable degree of self-governance.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.


**8. With reference to the Union Government's financial procedures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing the Union Budget, which is then presented to Parliament without any input from other departments.
2. The Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring parliamentary control over public expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in preparing the Union Budget, it is not solely responsible.  Other departments and ministries contribute significantly to budget formulation, providing estimates of their expenditure requirements. The Finance Ministry coordinates and integrates these inputs into the final budget document. Statement 2 is correct.  No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary control over public finances.  The Appropriation Act, passed by Parliament, authorizes the government to spend the allocated funds.  This ensures accountability and prevents unauthorized government spending.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the Union Government's financial procedures.


**9. With reference to the custodian of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India, as the head of state, is the ultimate custodian of the Constitution, responsible for upholding its provisions.
2. The Supreme Court of India, through its power of judicial review, plays a crucial role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution, acting as its guardian.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct, albeit in different ways. Statement 1 is correct in that the President, as the head of state, is the constitutional head and symbolically represents the Constitution. The President's oath of office underscores a commitment to uphold the Constitution. However, the President's role is largely ceremonial.  The actual safeguarding and interpretation of the Constitution are dynamic processes. Statement 2 is correct because the Supreme Court, through its power of judicial review, plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution.  The Court interprets the Constitution's provisions, settles disputes regarding its application, and declares laws inconsistent with the Constitution as void.  This judicial review acts as a crucial check on the actions of the legislature and the executive, ensuring that they remain within constitutional boundaries.  Therefore, both the President and the Supreme Court contribute to upholding the Constitution, although their roles differ significantly.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the classical language status:**

1.  The classical language status is conferred by the Government of India based on the recommendations of a committee of experts, evaluating factors such as the language's antiquity, its significant contribution to the country's cultural heritage, and its influence on other languages.
2.  Once a language receives classical language status, it becomes eligible for enhanced governmental support for the preservation and promotion of its literature, culture, and research.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the process and implications of conferring classical language status in India.  Statement 1 is accurate: the Government of India does confer classical language status based on the recommendations of a committee of experts, who assess various criteria such as the language's antiquity, its influence on other languages, and its overall contribution to India's cultural heritage.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Classical language status usually leads to increased government support for the promotion and preservation of the language's literature, culture, and research. This may include funding for research projects, establishing centers for the study of the language, and promoting its use in educational institutions.  Therefore, both statements reflect the reality of how classical language status is conferred and its subsequent benefits.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Legislative Council of a State in India:**

1. The Legislative Council of a State can be larger in size than half the size of the Legislative Assembly of that State but cannot exceed one-third of the total strength of the Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State nominates one-sixth of the total members of the Legislative Council, choosing individuals with expertise in various fields.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Legislative Council can be smaller than half the size of the Legislative Assembly, it cannot be larger.  The Constitution mandates that the maximum strength of a Legislative Council cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly of that particular state.  Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a State nominates one-sixth of the members of the Legislative Council. These nominated members are typically individuals with expertise in fields like literature, science, art, cooperative movement, or social service. This provision aims to bring diverse perspectives and expertise into the Council. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution, setting the foundational principles of the Indian state.
2. This provision is included among the Fundamental Duties of citizens, emphasizing their responsibility to safeguard the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble expresses the aspirations of the Indian state, including sovereignty, unity, and integrity,  the specific phrasing "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India" is not found in the Preamble.  The Preamble focuses on broader objectives like securing justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. Statement 2 is correct.  The phrase "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity and Integrity of India" is explicitly included as one of the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens (Article 51A). This duty emphasizes the citizens' responsibility in safeguarding the nation's unity and integrity. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the location of this provision.


**13. With reference to the fundamental object of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayati Raj system primarily aims to ensure financial mobilization at the local level, empowering Panchayats to generate their own resources.
2. The Panchayati Raj system seeks to achieve democratic decentralization by transferring power and responsibilities to local self-governing bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While financial mobilization is an important aspect of Panchayati Raj, it is not the primary objective.  The system aims to achieve broader goals of development and governance at the grassroots level.  Financial self-reliance is a means to an end, not the ultimate goal. Statement 2 is correct.  The fundamental objective of Panchayati Raj is to achieve democratic decentralization. This involves transferring powers and responsibilities from the central and state governments to local self-governing institutions (Panchayats), enabling greater participation of citizens in decision-making processes that directly affect their lives. This promotes local governance and increases accountability.  Therefore, only statement 2 reflects the core principle of Panchayati Raj.


**14. With reference to the "Welfare State" ideal in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The ideal of a "Welfare State" is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble of the Constitution, setting the tone for the nation's social and economic policies.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy provide the framework for establishing a "Welfare State" in India, outlining the government's role in promoting social welfare and economic justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to secure social, economic, and political justice, the specific term "Welfare State" is not explicitly used. The Preamble sets out broad objectives, leaving the specifics to be elaborated in other parts of the Constitution. Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) form the core of the Indian Constitution's commitment to establishing a "Welfare State."  The DPSPs advocate for social and economic justice, providing guidelines for government policies to ensure the welfare of citizens, reduce inequalities, and promote a just and equitable society.  The concept of a "Welfare State," with its emphasis on social security and economic well-being, is deeply embedded in the DPSPs.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional basis for the "Welfare State" ideal.


**15. With reference to the Parliamentary System of Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliamentary System in India is primarily characterized by the direct election of the President by the people, making him/her directly accountable to the electorate.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, ensuring that the executive branch remains accountable to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In India, the President is not directly elected by the people.  Instead, the President is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.  This indirect election ensures a balance of power between the central and state governments. Statement 2 is correct.  A defining feature of India's parliamentary system is the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  This means that the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha; if it loses a vote of confidence, it must resign.  This ensures that the executive branch remains accountable to the legislative branch.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of India's parliamentary system.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the lapsing of Bills in the Indian Parliament:**

1. A Bill pending in the Lok Sabha automatically lapses if the Lok Sabha is prorogued (adjourned indefinitely) before it is passed.
2. A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the rules governing the lapsing of Bills in the Indian Parliament. Statement 1 is correct.  When the Lok Sabha is prorogued, all Bills pending before it that have not been passed lapse and must be reintroduced if the government wishes to pursue them further.  This is a standard parliamentary procedure to prevent Bills from lingering indefinitely. Statement 2 is also correct.  A Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not yet been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  If the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the Bill remains pending in the Rajya Sabha, awaiting consideration by the newly elected Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha's role in the legislative process is preserved in such situations. Therefore, both statements correctly describe the rules concerning the lapsing of Bills.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment and tenure of the Chief Secretary in a State:**

1. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary, exercising his/her executive authority in matters of state administration.
2. The Chief Secretary in a State has a fixed tenure of five years, ensuring stability and continuity in the administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary, who is the head of the state's civil service. This appointment reflects the Governor's executive authority within the state.  However, the actual selection process often involves consultation with the Chief Minister and other relevant authorities. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure.  While there might be some informal norms or expectations regarding the duration of service, the Chief Secretary serves at the pleasure of the state government and can be transferred or replaced at any time.  The lack of a fixed tenure allows for flexibility in administrative appointments. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the appointment of the Chief Secretary.


**18. With reference to the "Gram Nyayalaya Act," consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are exclusively empowered to hear only civil cases, excluding criminal cases from their jurisdiction.
2. The Gram Nyayalaya Act allows for the inclusion of local social activists as mediators or conciliators to assist in resolving disputes outside of formal court proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are not limited to civil cases only. They have jurisdiction to hear both civil and criminal cases, subject to certain monetary and other limitations as specified in the Act.  This makes them accessible for a wider range of disputes at the grassroots level. Statement 2 is correct.  A notable feature of the Gram Nyayalaya Act is its provision for utilizing local social activists as mediators or conciliators.  This approach aims to promote amicable settlements of disputes through mediation and reconciliation, reducing the burden on formal court proceedings and enhancing access to justice.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of the Gram Nyayalaya Act.


**19. With reference to the Parliament of India's power to legislate on State List items, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Lok Sabha with a simple majority of its total membership.
2.  The Rajya Sabha's approval is necessary for the Parliament to legislate on any item in the State List, even if a resolution is passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 of the Indian Constitution empowers the Parliament to legislate on any matter in the State List (matters normally under state jurisdiction) if the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to do so.  A simple majority in the Rajya Sabha is sufficient for the passage of such a resolution.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha's resolution is the trigger for the Parliament's power to legislate on State List items, but the Lok Sabha's concurrence is also required for the actual legislation to be passed.  The Rajya Sabha's approval alone is not sufficient.  The Lok Sabha's role in the legislative process is preserved.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the parliamentary procedure for legislating on State List matters.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the minimum age and tenure of Panchayat members:**

1. The minimum age prescribed for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years, ensuring that only mature individuals participate in local governance.
2. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues for the remainder of its original term, not for a fresh full term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for being a member of a Panchayat is 21 years, not 25 years as stated.  This is specified under the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with Panchayati Raj institutions.  Statement 2 is correct. If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, the reconstituted Panchayat continues only for the remaining period of the original term.  It does not get a fresh full term.  This provision ensures that the normal term of the Panchayat is not unduly extended due to premature dissolution. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**21. With reference to the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals, consider the following statements:**

1. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals were primarily focused on introducing major social reforms, addressing issues like caste discrimination and gender inequality.
2. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals primarily focused on constitutional reforms, aiming to enhance Indian participation in governance and introduce elements of self-rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proposals indirectly touched upon some social issues, their main focus was not on social reforms.  The proposals were centered on constitutional and political reforms. Statement 2 is correct. The Montague-Chelmsford Report, which formed the basis for the Government of India Act of 1919, focused primarily on constitutional reforms.  Key proposals included the introduction of dyarchy (dual governance) in provinces, expanding legislative councils, and increasing Indian participation in the government.  The reforms aimed to gradually introduce elements of self-rule, although substantial power remained vested in the British government.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the core purpose of the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals.


**22. With reference to the objectives embodied in the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble explicitly mentions economic liberty as a fundamental objective, guaranteeing the right to pursue economic opportunities without undue government restrictions.
2. The Preamble explicitly guarantees liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, reflecting a commitment to individual freedoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to secure social and economic justice, it does not explicitly mention "economic liberty" as a separate and distinct objective. The focus is on broader concepts of justice and equality. Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble clearly states that the Constitution aims to secure to all citizens of India:  "Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship." This commitment to individual freedoms is a cornerstone of the Indian Constitution, reflected throughout its provisions. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects an objective explicitly stated in the Preamble.


**23. With reference to the Right against Exploitation as enshrined in the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right against Exploitation includes the prohibition of traffic in human beings, forced labor, and the employment of children in hazardous occupations.
2. The Right against Exploitation explicitly includes the abolition of untouchability, addressing historical social inequalities and discrimination.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Articles 23 and 24 of the Indian Constitution, which constitute the Right against Exploitation, specifically prohibit traffic in human beings, forced labor, and the employment of children below the age of 14 in hazardous occupations.  These provisions aim to protect vulnerable sections of society from exploitation. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the abolition of untouchability is a crucial aspect of social justice in India, it is not directly included under the Right against Exploitation.  Untouchability is addressed separately under Article 17, which declares it to be abolished and punishable by law.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the components of the Right against Exploitation.


**24. With reference to the nature of rights in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are primarily claims of the State against its citizens, defining the citizen's obligations and duties towards the State.
2. Rights are claims of the citizens against the State, limiting the State's power and protecting individual liberties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rights are not primarily claims of the State against its citizens.  The State's power is limited by the rights it grants to its citizens.  The rights protect individual freedoms and liberties, preventing the State from encroaching on these fundamental aspects of human life. Statement 2 is correct.  Rights are fundamentally claims of the citizens against the State, limiting the State's actions and protecting individual liberties.  These rights are often enshrined in constitutions or legal frameworks, guaranteeing certain freedoms and protections from arbitrary State actions.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the essential nature of rights in a State.


**25. With reference to the Fundamental Duties of an Indian citizen, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India provides a specific legislative process for enforcing the Fundamental Duties, ensuring their observance by citizens.
2. The Fundamental Duties are correlative to Fundamental Rights, implying that the enjoyment of rights is contingent upon the fulfillment of duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable.  There is no specific legislative process provided in the Constitution for enforcing these duties.  They primarily serve as moral obligations and aspirational guidelines for citizens. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While there is a conceptual link between rights and duties, the Constitution does not make the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights conditional upon the fulfillment of Fundamental Duties.  The rights are guaranteed irrespective of whether a citizen fulfills their duties. Therefore, both statements misrepresent the legal status and correlative nature of Fundamental Duties.


**26. With reference to the relationship between Rights and Duties in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are independent of Duties; the enjoyment of rights is not contingent upon the fulfillment of duties.
2. Rights and Duties are correlative; the enjoyment of rights implies a reciprocal obligation to fulfill corresponding duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Constitution does not explicitly make the enjoyment of rights dependent on the fulfillment of duties, the concept of correlative rights and duties is inherent in any well-functioning society.  Rights and responsibilities are interconnected; the exercise of rights should not be at the expense of others' rights or the well-being of society. Statement 2 is correct.  The ideal relationship between rights and duties is one of correlation.  The enjoyment of rights implies a reciprocal obligation to fulfill corresponding duties towards society, the state, and fellow citizens.  This ensures a balanced and harmonious coexistence.  Therefore, only statement 2 reflects a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the relationship between rights and duties.


**27. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution added the principle of "Equal pay for equal work for both men and women" to the Directive Principles.
2. The principle of "Securing living wage and human conditions of work to workers" was added to the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution (1976) added Article 39(d), which mandates equal pay for equal work for both men and women.  This reflects a commitment to gender equality in the workplace. Statement 2 is incorrect. The principle of "Securing living wage and human conditions of work to workers" was already present in the original Constitution (Article 43) and was not added by the 42nd Amendment.  The 42nd Amendment focused on adding new articles and making other changes to the Constitution.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the changes introduced by the 42nd Amendment to the Directive Principles.


**28. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles constitute limitations upon the legislative function of the government, guiding the enactment of laws.
2. The Directive Principles constitute limitations upon the executive function of the government, influencing policy implementation and administrative actions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) serve as guidelines for both the legislative and executive branches of the government. Statement 1 is correct because DPSPs influence the legislative process, guiding the enactment of laws that aim to achieve the socio-economic goals outlined in the DPSPs.  Lawmakers consider these principles when drafting and passing legislation. Statement 2 is also correct because DPSPs influence the executive's policy implementation and administrative actions.  The government's policies and programs are expected to align with the principles enshrined in the DPSPs, although they are not legally bound to do so.  Therefore, DPSPs play a guiding role in both the legislative and executive functions of the government.


**29. With reference to the eligibility for election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anyone residing in India can file a nomination paper for election to the Lok Sabha, regardless of citizenship status.
2. Only a citizen of India whose name is on the electoral roll of a constituency can file a nomination paper for election to the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, was enacted to define the term "Office of Profit" as mentioned in the Constitution.
2.  The Act exempts certain posts from disqualification on grounds of holding an "Office of Profit," and has undergone several amendments since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not explicitly define "Office of Profit."  The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, was enacted to address the issue of disqualifications for holding an "Office of Profit," but it doesn't define the term itself; it lists specific offices that are exempted. The definition is largely determined through judicial interpretation and evolving case law.  The lack of a precise constitutional definition has led to considerable debate and legal challenges over the years.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959,  was indeed designed to exempt certain posts from disqualification related to holding an "Office of Profit."  Furthermore, this Act has been amended multiple times to reflect changing circumstances and address the complexities arising from the interpretation of "Office of Profit."  These amendments reflect the ongoing effort to clarify and refine the criteria for disqualification.  The frequent amendments underscore the evolving nature of the definition and the need for legislative adaptation.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 44th Amendment Act introduced a new article to protect the election of the Prime Minister from judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court of India has never struck down any constitutional amendment on the grounds of violating the independence of the judiciary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 44th Amendment to the Constitution of India did not introduce any article specifically aimed at protecting the election of the Prime Minister from judicial review.  While the amendment did make changes related to the Fundamental Rights and other provisions, it did not directly address the Prime Minister's election process in relation to judicial review. Judicial review of government actions, including those concerning the Prime Minister's office, remains a crucial aspect of India's constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court of India *has* struck down constitutional amendments deemed to violate the basic structure doctrine, which includes the independence of the judiciary.  The 99th Amendment, though not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, is a prime example. The Court's upholding of the basic structure doctrine demonstrates its role as a guardian of the Constitution's fundamental principles and its power to review even constitutional amendments.  This power is essential for maintaining the balance of power within the Indian democratic system.



**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 142 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to pass orders or decrees that are not limited by ordinary laws.
2.  The Election Commission of India's decisions are entirely immune from judicial review under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 142 of the Indian Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. This inherent power allows the Court to issue orders or decrees that are not constrained by ordinary laws, if necessary to ensure justice.  This power is considered essential for the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of justice and to address exceptional circumstances where ordinary legal mechanisms might be insufficient.  However, the exercise of this power is subject to judicial restraint and principles of natural justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Election Commission of India enjoys significant independence and its decisions are given considerable weight, they are not entirely immune from judicial review.  The courts can review the Election Commission's decisions if there are allegations of procedural irregularities, bias, or violation of fundamental rights.  Judicial review in this context is essential to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the electoral process and uphold the rule of law.  The Supreme Court has, on several occasions, reviewed and even overturned decisions by the Election Commission.



**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule to the Constitution of India was introduced during the Prime Ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru.
2.  Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are completely immune from judicial review under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution of India by the First Amendment Act of 1951, during Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure as Prime Minister.  This amendment was primarily introduced to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review, given concerns about challenges based on fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially intended to shield laws from judicial scrutiny, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  This ruling signifies the Court's commitment to upholding the fundamental principles of the Constitution and its power to review even legislative actions aimed at circumventing judicial oversight. The Court's interpretation has significantly limited the scope and effect of the Ninth Schedule.



**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. No High Court can declare a central law constitutionally invalid.
2. The Supreme Court of India can question the wisdom of laws enacted by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. High Courts in India do have the power to declare central laws constitutionally invalid, but this power is subject to the final authority of the Supreme Court.  If a High Court declares a central law invalid, the case can be appealed to the Supreme Court, which has the final say on the matter.  The judicial review power vested in High Courts is an integral part of the Indian federal structure, ensuring checks and balances between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Supreme Court primarily focuses on the constitutionality of laws, it can, to a limited extent, examine the wisdom or reasonableness of laws.  However, this power is exercised cautiously and generally only when a law is demonstrably arbitrary, unreasonable, or violates fundamental rights.  The Court's role is primarily to uphold the Constitution, not to substitute its judgment for the legislature's on matters of policy.  The Court's power to review the wisdom of laws is a crucial aspect of judicial oversight, ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and preventing legislative overreach.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can declare a Financial Emergency without consulting the Council of Ministers.
2. State Legislatures cannot make laws on certain matters without the Union Legislature's concurrence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The declaration of a Financial Emergency by the President of India is not solely within the President's discretion. While the President has the power to declare such an emergency under Article 360 of the Constitution, this power is typically exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers' advice is crucial in ensuring that such a significant decision is made after careful consideration of the economic situation and its potential consequences. The involvement of the Council of Ministers maintains the principle of responsible government.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Constitution establishes a federal system with a distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States.  The Union List, State List, and Concurrent List outline the areas in which the Union Parliament and State Legislatures can make laws.  There are certain subjects, particularly those on the Union List, where the Union Parliament has exclusive legislative authority.  Furthermore, even on Concurrent List subjects, the Union Parliament's laws prevail in cases of conflict.  This arrangement reflects the Union's role in ensuring national unity and consistency in certain crucial policy areas.



**7. Consider the following statements about the impeachment of a Supreme Court Judge in India:**

1. The motion to impeach a Supreme Court judge can be rejected by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2. The Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, provides the details of the impeachment process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha cannot reject a motion for impeachment of a Supreme Court judge.  Once a motion is introduced in accordance with the prescribed procedure, it must be processed according to the constitutional provisions. The Speaker's role is primarily procedural, ensuring that the process unfolds as per the established rules. Rejecting the motion would be a violation of the constitutional process and the Speaker's constitutional duty.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, outlines the detailed procedure for the impeachment of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts.  It specifies the steps involved, including the initiation of the process, the conduct of the inquiry, and the requirements for a successful impeachment.  This Act is crucial in ensuring a fair and transparent process for removing judges on grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity.  The detailed provisions of this Act are essential for maintaining the integrity and independence of the judiciary.



**8. With reference to the Governor's role in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State cannot be prosecuted in any court during his term of office.
2. The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor cannot be diminished during his term of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a State enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution during his term of office.  This immunity is designed to protect the Governor's independence and prevent political interference in the discharge of his constitutional duties.  This protection is essential for ensuring the stability and impartiality of the State government.

Statement 2 is correct. The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor are protected from being diminished during his term of office.  This provision is also aimed at safeguarding the Governor's independence and preventing any attempts to influence his decisions through financial pressure.  This protection ensures that the Governor can perform his constitutional functions without fear of financial repercussions.



**9. Consider the following statements regarding the "Office of Profit":**

1. The Constitution of India provides a precise definition of "Office of Profit."
2. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, has been amended only once since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain a precise definition of "Office of Profit."  The term is interpreted through judicial pronouncements and legislative enactments.  This lack of a clear definition has led to considerable debate and litigation over the years, as the interpretation of what constitutes an "Office of Profit" has evolved through case law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, has undergone multiple amendments since its enactment.  These amendments reflect the complexities surrounding the interpretation of "Office of Profit" and the need to adapt the legislation to address emerging issues.  The frequent amendments highlight the ongoing debate and the need for legislative clarity in this area.


**10. With reference to the Legislative Assembly of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor addresses the Assembly at the commencement of the first session of each year. This address is mandatory as per the Constitution.
2. In the absence of a specific rule in the State Legislature, the Lok Sabha's rules are followed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While it is customary for the Governor to address the State Legislative Assembly at the commencement of the first session of the year, it is not constitutionally mandatory.  The address is a convention, not a constitutional requirement.  The content of the address usually outlines the government's legislative agenda and other policy initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the absence of a specific rule governing a particular matter in the State Legislature, the State Legislature typically adopts the rules and procedures of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament.  This practice ensures consistency and uniformity in parliamentary procedures across the country.   This ensures that legislative proceedings are conducted in a manner that is both effective and adheres to established parliamentary norms.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Charter Act of 1813:**

1. The Act ended the East India Company's trade monopoly in India, except for tea and trade with China.
2. The Act explicitly asserted the British Crown's sovereignty over Indian territories held by the Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Charter Act of 1813 significantly altered the East India Company's position in India by ending its monopoly on trade, except for the trade in tea and trade with China. This marked a shift towards a more open trading system in India, although the Company retained its political control. The opening of trade to other British companies had significant economic and political ramifications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 did not explicitly assert the British Crown's sovereignty over Indian territories held by the Company. The Company continued to exercise significant political authority in India. The assertion of direct Crown sovereignty came later, primarily with the Government of India Act 1858, following the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.


**12. With reference to the review of independent regulators in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Parliamentary Department-Related Standing Committees review the performance of independent regulators.
2. Ad-hoc committees set up by the Parliament also review independent regulators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parliamentary Department-Related Standing Committees play a crucial role in overseeing the functioning of independent regulators in sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and electricity. These committees scrutinize the regulators’ budgets, performance, and adherence to regulatory mandates.  This oversight mechanism is critical for maintaining accountability and transparency within these crucial sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Parliament can indeed set up ad-hoc committees for specific purposes, it is not a regular or primary mechanism for reviewing independent regulators. The Department-Related Standing Committees provide a more structured and continuous oversight function.  Ad-hoc committees are typically formed to deal with specific, time-bound issues, rather than providing ongoing monitoring of regulatory bodies.


**13. Consider the following statements about the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB):**

1. PNGRB was the first regulatory body established by the Government of India.
2.  One of PNGRB’s key functions is to promote competitive markets for gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PNGRB was not the first regulatory body established by the Government of India.  Several other regulatory bodies existed prior to the establishment of PNGRB. The order of establishment of various regulatory bodies varies across sectors and time periods.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of the PNGRB is to promote competition in the natural gas market.  The Board works towards creating a level playing field for various players in the gas sector and ensuring efficient allocation of gas resources.  This function is crucial for ensuring reasonable prices and reliable gas supplies to consumers.  The promotion of competition is a central tenet of PNGRB's mandate.


**14. With reference to Money Bills, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can include provisions relating to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.
2. A Money Bill cannot deal with the regulation of borrowing of money or giving of any guarantee by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Constitution, can indeed contain provisions related to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.  This is a core component of a Money Bill's scope.  It reflects the Parliament's power over taxation and government finances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A Money Bill *can* deal with the regulation of borrowing of money or the giving of any guarantee by the Government of India.  These are also considered financial matters, falling under the purview of a Money Bill.  The inclusion of such provisions reflects the Parliament's control over government borrowing and financial liabilities.  The scope of a Money Bill is quite broad in terms of financial matters.


**15. With reference to the right to marry a person of one's choice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. This right is explicitly guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.
2. This right is implicitly protected under Article 21 of the Constitution, as part of the right to life and personal liberty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 19 of the Constitution deals with the freedoms of speech, expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession. It does not explicitly mention the right to marry a person of one's choice. While the right to choose one's life partner is related to personal liberty and freedom of choice, it's not directly covered under Article 19.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has interpreted Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) broadly to encompass the right to marry a person of one's choice. This interpretation reflects the Court's recognition of the importance of personal autonomy and freedom of choice in matters of marriage. The right to marry is thus viewed as an essential component of the right to life and personal liberty.


**16. With reference to the transfer of tribal land for mining, consider the following statements:**

1. Such transfers can be declared null and void under the provisions of the Third Schedule of the Constitution.
2. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution provides mechanisms to prevent the alienation of tribal land.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Third Schedule of the Constitution deals with the Forms of Oaths or Affirmations. It has no relevance to the transfer of tribal land or mining activities. The Third Schedule is entirely unrelated to land rights or tribal affairs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes. It provides for the establishment of tribal advisory councils and other mechanisms to protect the interests of tribal communities, including their land rights.  The provisions of the Fifth Schedule are designed to prevent the alienation of tribal land and ensure the sustainable development of tribal areas.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:**

1. The Act grants forest dwellers the right to fell bamboos grown in forest areas.
2. The Act recognizes bamboo as a minor forest produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, generally grants forest dwellers rights over minor forest produce, including the right to collect, use, and in certain cases, fell  bamboos grown in forest areas.  The exact extent of these rights can depend on specific local regulations and customary practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, explicitly recognizes bamboo as a minor forest produce. This recognition is crucial for securing the rights of forest dwellers over this important resource. The recognition of bamboo as minor forest produce has significant implications for the livelihoods of tribal communities and the sustainable management of forest resources.


**18. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card can be used as proof of citizenship or domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or amended by the issuing authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Aadhaar card contains demographic information, it is not legally considered proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined by the Citizenship Act, 1955, and domicile is determined by state-specific laws.  Aadhaar is primarily a biometric identification system, not a document establishing citizenship or residency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated or amended under certain circumstances, such as if there are errors in the information provided or if an individual requests a change.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has mechanisms for updating Aadhaar data and addressing discrepancies.  The ability to amend Aadhaar information is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the database.


**19. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a five-member body.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs determines the election schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is not a five-member body; it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and can have up to two other Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can vary depending on the needs of the Commission.  The composition of the Election Commission is designed to ensure its independence and impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, not the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, is responsible for determining the election schedule.  This independence is crucial for ensuring the impartiality and fairness of the electoral process. The Commission's autonomy is a key element in maintaining the integrity of India's democratic system.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the consequences of President's Rule in a State:**

1. The State Legislative Assembly is automatically dissolved upon the proclamation of President's Rule.
2. Local bodies are automatically dissolved upon the proclamation of President's Rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State Legislative Assembly is not automatically dissolved upon the proclamation of President's Rule. While President's Rule often leads to the Assembly's dissolution, it's not an automatic consequence.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly rests with the President, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The dissolution of the Assembly depends on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Local bodies are also not automatically dissolved upon the proclamation of President's Rule.  The dissolution of local bodies is not a direct or automatic consequence of President's Rule. The decision about local bodies depends on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation by the concerned authorities.  The continuation or dissolution of local bodies is a matter of administrative discretion.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body with a single Chief Election Commissioner and a variable number of Election Commissioners, as determined by the government.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs plays a significant role in setting the election schedule for both general and by-elections, although the Election Commission has the final authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India's composition is not fixed at five members. It comprises a Chief Election Commissioner and a number of Election Commissioners, as determined by the government from time to time. This allows for flexibility in managing the workload of elections of varying scales. The number of Election Commissioners can range from zero to several, depending on the needs and demands of election management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Home Affairs is involved in the logistical aspects of elections, it does not decide the election schedule. The Election Commission of India is constitutionally mandated to independently determine and announce the election schedule.  The Home Ministry might provide support and resources, but the final decision rests solely with the Election Commission to ensure impartiality and prevent any political influence on the election process.  This independence is crucial for maintaining the credibility and fairness of elections.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding President's Rule in a State:**

1. The proclamation of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, although exceptions exist.
2.  The removal of the Council of Ministers in a State is a necessary consequence of the proclamation of President's Rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's Rule often results in the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an automatic or mandatory consequence.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, depending on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation. The decision is made based on various factors, including the severity of the crisis, the possibility of restoring order without dissolving the Assembly, and the overall political context.

Statement 2 is correct. The imposition of President's Rule signifies a breakdown of constitutional governance in a state. As a direct consequence, the existing Council of Ministers loses its legitimacy and is removed from power.  The Governor, acting on the President's behalf, assumes executive authority and forms a new administration or maintains a caretaker government until normalcy is restored. This is essential for restoring order and stability within the state.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. Indian federalism is characterized by the existence of an independent judiciary, which is a cornerstone of its democratic structure.
2. The Indian federal system is a result of a negotiated agreement between the various federating units prior to its establishment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The independent judiciary is a crucial element of Indian federalism. It acts as an arbiter between the Centre and the States, ensuring that neither oversteps its constitutional boundaries.  The judiciary's power of judicial review allows it to strike down laws that violate the Constitution, maintaining a balance of power between the different levels of government. This independence is essential for upholding the principles of federalism and protecting the rights of citizens.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Unlike some federations formed through explicit agreements between pre-existing entities, the Indian federal system evolved differently.  While there were negotiations and discussions during the process of independence, the final structure was not a direct outcome of a formal agreement among the federating units. It was established through the Constitution of India, which was framed by a Constituent Assembly representing the entire nation. The Constitution defined the relationship between the Centre and the States, laying down the framework for Indian federalism.


**4. With reference to the control mechanisms of the Parliament over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament utilizes the adjournment motion as a tool to express its disapproval of the government's actions.
2. The supplementary questions during Question Hour provide the Parliament with a detailed understanding of government policies and actions.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The adjournment motion is a parliamentary procedure used to express strong disapproval of government actions.  While it doesn't directly remove the government, it serves as a powerful tool to hold the executive accountable.  If the motion is successful, it can disrupt the normal business of the House and highlight the gravity of the issue.

Statement 2 is correct. The Question Hour, including supplementary questions, is a crucial mechanism for parliamentary oversight.  Supplementary questions allow MPs to delve deeper into the answers provided by ministers, seeking clarification and demanding accountability.  This process helps expose any deficiencies, inconsistencies, or lack of transparency in government actions and policies.  The detailed questioning allows for greater scrutiny and understanding of the issues.


**5. With reference to Private Member's Bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the ruling party.
2. Private member's bills have been successfully passed in the Indian Parliament on several occasions throughout its history.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister. While it's not explicitly defined as being only from the opposition, it's predominantly members who are not part of the executive branch (i.e. the ruling coalition) that introduce such bills. The focus is on the member's private capacity rather than the government's official agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While private members' bills are introduced, their passage into law is exceptionally rare. The government's legislative agenda typically dominates parliamentary time, and private members' bills often face significant hurdles, including time constraints and lack of government support.  The passage of a private member's bill is a notable event, highlighting the exceptional circumstances required for such a bill to succeed.


**6. With reference to the advantages of the parliamentary form of government, consider the following statements:**

1. In a parliamentary system, the executive and legislature maintain a clear separation of powers to ensure checks and balances.
2. The parliamentary system ensures the executive's accountability to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key feature of the parliamentary system is the fusion of executive and legislative powers.  The executive branch (the government) is drawn from and accountable to the legislature (the Parliament).  This fusion, rather than separation, is what distinguishes it from a presidential system.

Statement 2 is correct.  Accountability is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system. The government needs the confidence of the Parliament to remain in power.  Mechanisms such as Question Hour, debates, and no-confidence motions ensure that the executive branch is answerable to the legislature for its actions and policies.  This accountability helps to maintain democratic governance.


**7. With reference to the principle underlying the Cabinet form of Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The cabinet system primarily aims to minimize criticism of the government by presenting a united front.
2. The Cabinet system is a mechanism that ensures the collective responsibility of the government to the legislature and the people.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the cabinet system does present a united front to the public, its primary purpose is not to minimize criticism.  The principle of collective responsibility ensures that the cabinet acts as a cohesive unit, taking responsibility for decisions made collectively.  Criticism is inevitable in a democratic system, but collective responsibility is about the cabinet's overall accountability.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Cabinet form of government is based on the principle of collective responsibility.  This means that the entire cabinet is responsible for the government's actions and policies.  If a minister disagrees with a cabinet decision, they are expected to resign.  This principle ensures that the government is accountable to the legislature and ultimately, to the people.


**8. With reference to Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review empowers the judiciary to assess the wisdom and effectiveness of laws enacted by the legislature.
2. Judicial review grants the judiciary the power to determine the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India does not involve evaluating the wisdom or effectiveness of legislation.  The judiciary's role is to assess the constitutionality of a law, not its policy merits.  The legislature is responsible for policy-making, and the judiciary's role is to ensure that those policies are within the constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is correct. Judicial review is a fundamental power of the Indian judiciary. It allows the courts to examine laws and executive actions to determine whether they are consistent with the Constitution.  If a law or action is found to be unconstitutional, the court can strike it down. This power is essential to uphold the rule of law and protect fundamental rights.


**9. With reference to the implications of equality in a society, consider the following statements:**

1. Equality in a society necessitates the absence of privileges granted to specific groups or individuals.
2. Equality in a society necessarily implies the complete absence of competition among individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Equality before the law and equal opportunity are central tenets of a just society.  Privileges that favor certain groups over others undermine the principle of equality.  A truly egalitarian society strives to eliminate such privileges, ensuring that all individuals are treated fairly and have equal chances to succeed.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Equality does not preclude competition.  In fact, a competitive environment can be conducive to a just society as long as it is fair and equitable.  Competition becomes problematic when it is based on unequal access to resources or opportunities, or when certain groups are systematically disadvantaged.  A just society encourages fair competition while eliminating systemic inequalities.


**10. With reference to the residuary powers under the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The residuary powers under the Government of India Act 1935 were vested with the Governor-General of India.
2. The residuary powers under the Government of India Act 1935 were vested with the Federal Legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Under the Government of India Act 1935, the residuary powers (those not explicitly assigned to the provinces or the federal legislature) were vested with the Governor-General.  This reflected the Act's overall emphasis on centralized power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The federal legislature did not possess the residuary powers under the 1935 Act.  The Governor-General's authority over these powers further strengthened the central government's control. This design was a key characteristic of the 1935 Act, which, despite its federal features, retained significant centralized control.


**11. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. An Aadhaar card can be used as definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or removed by the issuing authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Aadhaar card is primarily a proof of identity and address, not citizenship or domicile.  While it can be used as supporting documentation, it does not independently establish citizenship or residential status.  Other documents are required to confirm these statuses.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  An Aadhaar number can be deactivated or removed under certain circumstances.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has established procedures for correcting errors, updating information, and, in some cases, deactivating Aadhaar numbers if necessary.  This ensures the accuracy and integrity of the Aadhaar database.


**12. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned and guaranteed as a fundamental right in a dedicated article within Part III of the Constitution of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in a separate article in Part III of the Constitution.  Its recognition as a fundamental right emerged through judicial interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, in the Puttaswamy case (2017), ruled that the Right to Privacy is an intrinsic part of Article 21, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty. This landmark judgment established the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, although it wasn't explicitly stated in the original text of the Constitution.


**13. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The value of each Member of Legislative Assembly's (MLA's) vote is uniform across all states.
2. The value of each Member of Parliament's (MP's) vote is the same for both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The value of an MLA's vote varies from state to state. It is calculated based on the state's population and the number of MLAs.  Larger states have higher vote values for their MLAs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The value of an MP's vote is not the same for both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members. The value is calculated differently for each house, taking into account the number of members in each house.  This ensures a balance of representation between the two houses in presidential elections.


**14. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor of a State in any court during their term of office.
2. The emoluments and allowances of a Governor of a State cannot be decreased during their term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor enjoys immunity from criminal proceedings during their term of office.  This protection is essential to ensure their impartiality and independence in performing their constitutional duties.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor's emoluments and allowances are protected from reduction during their term.  This safeguard ensures their financial security and prevents any undue political pressure that might compromise their independence.  This principle is similar to the protection afforded to judges.


**15. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Government Assurances scrutinizes the implementation of assurances given by the government in Parliament.
2. The Rules Committee deals with matters related to the scrutiny and reporting on the proper exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances is responsible for monitoring the government's fulfillment of promises and assurances made in Parliament.  It ensures that the government is held accountable for its commitments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation, not the Rules Committee, scrutinizes and reports on the executive's exercise of delegated legislative powers.  The Rules Committee deals with the rules and procedures of the House itself.  The distinction is important in understanding the division of labor within parliamentary oversight.


**16. With reference to the Speaker of a Legislative Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker vacates their office if they cease to be a member of the Assembly.
2. The Speaker automatically vacates their office upon the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker's position is intrinsically linked to their membership in the Assembly.  If they lose their membership for any reason, they automatically cease to hold the Speaker's office.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the dissolution of the Assembly brings an end to the current legislative session, the Speaker's term doesn't automatically end.  The Speaker continues in office until a new Assembly is constituted and a new Speaker is elected.  This continuity is important for maintaining procedural consistency.


**17. With reference to the consequences of President's Rule under Article 356, consider the following statements:**

1. The imposition of President's Rule automatically leads to the suspension of Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly, etc.) in the affected state.
2. Under President's Rule, the Parliament gains the power to make laws for the affected state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's Rule does not automatically suspend Article 19.  While the state government's powers are taken over by the central government, the fundamental rights of citizens are not automatically suspended.  The suspension of fundamental rights requires a separate process under specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant consequence of President's Rule is that the Parliament gains the power to make laws for the affected state.  This is a crucial aspect of central intervention, allowing the central government to address the governance crisis and restore order.  The Parliament's legislative power extends to areas normally under the purview of the state legislature.


**18. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.
2. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule.  This power was initially intended to protect land reforms and other socially beneficial legislation from judicial scrutiny.

Statement 2 is partially correct, but has been significantly modified by judicial pronouncements. Initially, laws in the Ninth Schedule were largely considered immune from judicial review.  However, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  This significantly limits the original intent of the Ninth Schedule.


**19. With reference to the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (Anti-Defection Law), consider the following statements:**

1. The Tenth Schedule deals with the disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on grounds of defection.
2. The Tenth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, also known as the Anti-Defection Law, provides for the disqualification of MPs and MLAs who defect from their elected parties. This is aimed at maintaining political stability and preventing horse-trading.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Tenth Schedule was added by the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, not the 42nd Amendment Act.  The 42nd Amendment made significant changes to the Constitution, but the Anti-Defection Law came later.


**20.  With reference to the Eleventh and Twelfth Schedules of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Eleventh Schedule deals with the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Municipalities.
2. The Twelfth Schedule deals with the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The Eleventh Schedule (added by the 73rd Amendment Act) deals with Panchayats, while the Twelfth Schedule (added by the 74th Amendment Act) deals with Municipalities. The schedules outline the functional areas of these local governing bodies.  The numbers are often confused because they are sequential and deal with local governance.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates direct elections for all Panchayats at all three levels (village, intermediate, and district).
2.  The 74th Amendment Act stipulates that one-third of the seats in municipalities must be reserved for women, in addition to seats reserved for SC and ST women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does *not* mandate direct elections for all Panchayats at all three levels. While it aims to establish a three-tier panchayati raj system, the mode of election for chairpersons at the intermediate and district levels is left to the discretion of the state legislatures.  Many states opt for indirect elections at these levels.  The focus of the amendment is on establishing the institutional framework and guaranteeing certain minimum powers to Panchayats, not prescribing a uniform election system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 74th Amendment Act clearly mandates that at least one-third of the total number of seats in every municipality shall be reserved for women. This reservation is in addition to any reservation already provided for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes women. This is a crucial provision aimed at enhancing women's political representation in urban local bodies.  The act explicitly addresses this aspect of gender equality in local governance.


**2. With reference to the provisions related to Nagar Panchayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nagar Panchayats are constituted for larger urban areas with a high population density and complex administrative needs.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act specifies the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Nagar Panchayats concerning urban development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nagar Panchayats are specifically constituted for *smaller* urban areas, those in a transitional phase between rural and urban development.  They are not intended for large, densely populated urban areas which typically fall under Municipal Councils or Municipal Corporations. The establishment of Nagar Panchayats is a key feature of the 74th Amendment Act designed to provide a structured system of local governance for smaller towns and growing settlements.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act, which deals with the constitution of municipalities, includes Nagar Panchayats within its purview.  The Act details the powers, authority, and responsibilities that these bodies possess, covering various aspects of urban planning, administration, and development within their jurisdiction.  This is a significant aspect of the Act's attempt to establish a multi-tiered system of urban local governance.


**3. With reference to the 74th Amendment Act on Municipalities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act empowers the state legislature to determine the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of municipalities.
2.  The Act mandates that elections to municipalities must be held every 5 years, irrespective of any dissolution or other circumstances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act does *not* centrally prescribe a uniform procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit for all municipalities. Instead, it empowers the state legislatures to define these procedures. This allows for flexibility in adapting accounting and audit practices to the specific needs and contexts of different states and municipalities.  This decentralization is a key aspect of the federal structure in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 74th Amendment Act aims to ensure regular and periodic elections to municipalities, it does *not* mandate that elections must be held every 5 years irrespective of any dissolution or other unforeseen circumstances.  The Act provides for the conduct of elections within a reasonable timeframe after a dissolution, but this timeframe is not rigidly fixed at 5 years in all situations.  The specific timelines might vary based on legal and administrative exigencies.


**4. Consider the following statements about the role of the State Governor in relation to municipalities:**

1.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, who then forms the state government and oversees the functioning of municipalities.
2.  The Governor decides the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state plays a crucial role in the formation of the state government. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, usually the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislative assembly. The Chief Minister then advises the Governor on the appointment of other ministers and forms the council of ministers. This council of ministers is responsible for the overall administration of the state, including overseeing the functioning of municipalities. The Governor's role is primarily ceremonial in this context, but the appointment of the Chief Minister is a critical constitutional function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor does *not* have the power to decide the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of municipalities. This power rests with the state legislature. The 74th Amendment Act empowers the state legislature to determine the accounting and auditing procedures for municipalities, reflecting the principle of legislative autonomy at the state level. The Governor's role is largely confined to ceremonial and constitutional functions, not executive control over municipal affairs.


**5. With reference to reservations in municipalities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in municipalities is proportional to their population in the respective municipal area.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act introduced the concept of reservation of seats for women in municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in municipalities. The principle followed is that the number of reserved seats should be proportional to their population within the respective municipal area. This ensures that these historically marginalized communities have adequate representation in local governance.  The Act aims to promote social justice and inclusivity in urban areas.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 74th Amendment Act introduced a significant provision for reservation of seats specifically for women in municipalities.  It mandates that at least one-third of the total number of seats in every municipality must be reserved for women. This is a landmark step toward enhancing women's political participation and leadership in local governance. The provision is in addition to any reservation already in place for SC and ST women.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the periodic elections of municipalities:**

1.  The 74th Amendment Act mandates that municipalities must hold elections every five years.
2.  The state election commission is responsible for conducting elections to municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 74th Amendment Act aims to ensure regular elections, it doesn't mandate a fixed five-year term for all municipalities.  The Act emphasizes periodic elections to ensure democratic accountability, but the exact frequency and timing can be influenced by factors like dissolution, court orders, or state-specific legislation. The provision for regular elections is crucial for the successful functioning of democratic local governance but doesn't prescribe a rigid five-year cycle.

Statement 2 is correct. The State Election Commission (SEC) plays a vital role in conducting elections to municipalities.  The SEC is an independent body responsible for ensuring free and fair elections.  Its independence is crucial to safeguarding the democratic process at the local level.  The SEC's role is defined by state-specific legislation and the provisions of the 74th Amendment Act, which establishes the framework for urban local governance.


**7. With reference to the Governor's powers concerning municipalities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor has the power to dissolve a municipality if it fails to perform its functions effectively.
2. The Governor can directly intervene in the day-to-day administration of municipalities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Governor does not possess the power to directly dissolve a municipality.  While the Governor holds significant constitutional powers in relation to the state government, direct intervention in the affairs of local bodies like municipalities is not within their purview.  The state government, through the council of ministers, is responsible for the oversight and management of municipalities.  The Governor's powers are largely confined to constitutional and ceremonial functions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Governor cannot directly intervene in the day-to-day administration of municipalities. The day-to-day functioning of municipalities is the responsibility of the elected municipal bodies and the state government. The Governor's role is primarily constitutional, and direct involvement in the administrative details of local bodies would be an overreach of their authority. The principle of separation of powers and the autonomy of local governance are vital aspects of the Indian constitutional framework.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the organizational structure of urban local bodies:**

1.  The 74th Amendment Act establishes a three-tier system of municipalities: Nagar Panchayats, Municipal Councils, and Municipal Corporations.
2.  The Act empowers the state government to determine the specific organizational structure of different types of municipalities within the state.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key feature of the 74th Amendment Act is the establishment of a three-tier system for urban local bodies. This system comprises Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas, Municipal Councils for intermediate-sized towns, and Municipal Corporations for larger cities.  This tiered structure allows for a more nuanced and appropriate level of governance to be applied to urban areas of varying sizes and complexities.  The establishment of this framework is a central element of the Act's aim to strengthen urban local governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the 74th Amendment Act establishes the basic framework, it also allows for flexibility in adapting the organizational structure to suit the specific needs and circumstances of different states.  State governments are empowered to determine the precise organizational structure and composition of the various types of municipalities within their jurisdiction. This flexibility accounts for the variations in urban development patterns and administrative requirements across different states. The act balances the need for a national framework with the recognition of state-level variations.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House), not the Rajya Sabha (Upper House). This is a crucial aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, designed to ensure the government's control over financial matters. The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial legislation is a key feature of its power structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only recommend amendments to the Lok Sabha, which can accept or reject those recommendations. The Lok Sabha's final say over Money Bills is a fundamental aspect of the constitutional framework safeguarding the government's financial authority.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role prevents undue delays and obstructions in the passage of crucial financial legislation.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Amendment Act.
2.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the First Amendment Act of 1951.  This was done primarily to protect certain land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, reflecting the government's desire to implement its socio-economic agenda without immediate legal challenges.  The historical context of the post-independence period highlights the government's focus on rapid social and economic change.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs clarification. While initially, laws included in the Ninth Schedule were largely considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court's decision in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* (2007) significantly altered this position. The court held that while laws in the Ninth Schedule are not automatically immune, they are still subject to the basic structure doctrine.  This means that even laws placed in the Ninth Schedule can be challenged in court if they violate the fundamental principles of the Constitution.  The evolving judicial interpretation of the Ninth Schedule showcases the dynamic interplay between legislative and judicial powers.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the State.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor, based on the majority support in the State Legislative Assembly, appoints the Chief Minister. This process reflects the principle of parliamentary democracy at the state level. However, the Governor's role is largely formal; the actual power lies with the party that commands a majority in the Assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, they cannot do so at any time.  The power to dissolve is usually exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister, typically when the government loses its majority or when a serious constitutional crisis emerges.  The Governor's power of dissolution is a discretionary power, but its exercise is subject to constitutional and political constraints.  Improper use of this power can lead to significant political repercussions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a constitutional body.
2. The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed from office only by impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Constitution. This constitutional status ensures its independence and impartiality in conducting elections. The independence of the Election Commission is crucial for the credibility of the democratic process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the removal process for the Chief Election Commissioner is complex and requires the President's action, it does not involve impeachment.  The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed by the President on the grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity, but this requires the President to act on the recommendation of the Parliament.  This process, though demanding, is different from the formal impeachment procedure prescribed for the President and the judges of the Supreme Court.


**5. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college consisting of elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies.
2. The President can be removed from office only by impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies.  The system of indirect election ensures that the President is chosen by representatives of the people at both the national and state levels. This reflects the federal structure of the Indian polity.

Statement 2 is correct. The President can be removed from office only through impeachment, a process involving a detailed procedure laid down in the Constitution. Impeachment requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament, ensuring a high threshold for removal. This safeguards the office of the President and prevents its misuse.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the Prime Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is indeed responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination, the most prestigious exam for recruitment into the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and other all-India services. This crucial role highlights the UPSC's importance in maintaining the quality and integrity of the civil services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  This ensures the UPSC's independence from the executive branch of government. The President's role in the appointment process reinforces the constitutional status and impartiality of the Commission.


**7. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Directive Principles are justiciable.
2. Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable in courts.  They serve as guidelines for the government to frame its policies and legislation towards achieving social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles reflects a balance between the government's policy goals and the limitations of judicial enforcement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic equality and justice. They address issues such as providing education, healthcare, and social security, reflecting a commitment to improving the lives of citizens.  The inclusion of Directive Principles demonstrates the Constitution's focus on creating a just and equitable society beyond the basic framework of fundamental rights.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President of India. This appointment process underscores the CAG's independence from the executive branch. The President's role ensures the neutrality and impartiality of the CAG's audits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts not only of the Union Government but also of the State Governments and other public authorities. This broad mandate highlights the CAG's crucial role in ensuring accountability and transparency in public finances across all levels of government.  The CAG's comprehensive auditing function is essential for maintaining financial probity in the Indian system.



**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Right to Equality includes the abolition of untouchability.
2.  Right to Freedom includes the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Right to Equality, enshrined in Articles 14-18, explicitly includes the abolition of untouchability (Article 17).  This reflects the Constitution's commitment to eradicating caste-based discrimination. The inclusion of this provision highlights the Constitution's proactive approach to addressing historical social injustices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Right to Freedom, guaranteed under Articles 19-22, includes the freedom of movement throughout the territory of India. This fundamental right is essential for individual liberty and the free flow of people within the country.  The freedom of movement is an integral component of a free and open society.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Governor's power to issue Ordinances:**

1. An ordinance issued by the Governor has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.
2. An ordinance issued by the Governor remains in force indefinitely.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  An ordinance promulgated by the Governor under Article 213 of the Constitution has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.  However, it is subject to certain limitations and conditions.  The ordinance-making power is a crucial mechanism for the Governor to address urgent matters when the legislature is not in session.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An ordinance issued by the Governor does not remain in force indefinitely. It must be approved by the State Legislature within six weeks of its reassembly. If not approved, it ceases to have effect.  This limitation prevents the Governor from circumventing the legislative process and ensures the legislature's ultimate authority.  The time limit on ordinances maintains the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.



**11. With reference to the amendment of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The power to amend the Constitution lies with the Parliament.
2. A constitutional amendment requires a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The power to amend the Constitution of India resides with the Parliament.  This is a fundamental aspect of the Indian constitutional framework.  However, the process of amendment is not uniform for all provisions.  Certain provisions require a special majority, while others require ratification by state legislatures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A constitutional amendment does not always require a simple majority. The Constitution lays down different procedures for amending different parts.  Some amendments require a special majority (two-thirds majority in both Houses) and, in some cases, ratification by half of the state legislatures.  The varying requirements for amendment reflect the importance and sensitivity of different constitutional provisions.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented first in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. This is in line with the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.  The presentation in the Lok Sabha underscores the lower house's dominance in budgetary processes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament before it becomes law.  While the Lok Sabha plays a primary role, the Rajya Sabha's concurrence is required for the Budget's passage. This reflects the balance of power between the two houses in the parliamentary system.  The requirement of approval from both houses ensures comprehensive scrutiny of the budget proposals.


**13. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country.
2. The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the Chief Justice of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country, having the final say on legal matters.  Its position at the apex of the judicial hierarchy is crucial for upholding the rule of law and ensuring uniformity in legal interpretation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President of India, in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and other judges.  The President's role in the appointment process safeguards the independence of the judiciary from undue executive influence. The consultation process ensures a well-considered and objective selection of judges.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions:**

1. Panchayati Raj Institutions are established under a constitutional amendment.
2. Panchayati Raj Institutions are responsible for local-level governance in rural areas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) were established under a constitutional amendment—the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.  This amendment added Part IX to the Constitution, enshrining PRIs as a constitutional body. This constitutional status reinforces the importance of PRIs in local governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  PRIs are responsible for local-level governance in rural areas, empowering local communities to participate in decision-making processes affecting their lives.  The establishment of PRIs reflects a commitment to democratic decentralization.  The devolution of power to PRIs is a crucial aspect of participatory democracy.


**15. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India appoints the Chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC).
2. The NCSC is responsible for investigating complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chairperson of the NCSC is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment process ensures the independence and impartiality of the NCSC. The President's role reinforces the constitutional mandate to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC is tasked with investigating complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes, ensuring accountability and redressal of grievances.  The NCSC's investigative powers are crucial for upholding the constitutional rights of Scheduled Castes and combating discrimination.  The NCSC's work is vital for promoting social justice.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent House, and its members are not subject to dissolution.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend Money Bills.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, is a permanent House; its members are not subject to dissolution.  One-third of its members retire every two years, ensuring continuity and stability in the upper house.  The permanent nature of the Rajya Sabha reflects its role as a house of review and deliberation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend Money Bills.  It can only recommend amendments to the Lok Sabha, which can accept or reject them.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.  The limited role of the Rajya Sabha in Money Bills prevents undue delays in financial legislation.


**17. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution.
2. The Parliament can pass laws on any subject in the Union List.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, although the procedure for amendment varies depending on the provision being amended.  Some provisions require a special majority, while others require ratification by state legislatures.  The Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is a fundamental aspect of its legislative authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament can pass laws on any subject in the Union List, which covers matters of national importance such as defense, foreign affairs, and currency.  The Union List is a key aspect of the federal structure, defining the areas of exclusive legislative competence for the Parliament.  The Parliament's exclusive power over the Union List is a crucial element of national unity and coordination.


**18. Consider the following statements about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body.
2. The NHRC can issue binding orders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  Its statutory status provides a legal framework for its operations and powers.  The Act defines its composition, powers, and functions, ensuring a clear mandate for the Commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's recommendations and observations are not legally binding.  It can investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial actions to the government, but it cannot enforce its decisions.  The non-binding nature of the NHRC's orders reflects a balance between its investigative role and the government's ultimate responsibility for policy and action.  Its influence relies heavily on moral authority and public pressure.


**19. With reference to the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties are justiciable.
2. Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Fundamental Duties are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  They are meant to guide the citizens' behavior and promote a sense of national unity and responsibility.  The non-justiciable nature of Fundamental Duties reflects a focus on moral and ethical obligations rather than legally enforceable rights.

Statement 2 is correct. Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  This amendment introduced Part IVA to the Constitution, incorporating these duties.  The addition of Fundamental Duties reflected a broader vision of citizenship and national identity.


**20. Consider the following statements about the Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India every five years.  This ensures the Commission's independence from the executive branch of government.  The President's role reinforces the Commission's constitutional role in fiscal matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary function of the Finance Commission is to make recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States.  This crucial role highlights the Commission's importance in maintaining fiscal balance and equity in the federal system. The Commission's recommendations guide the government's fiscal policy.


**1. With reference to the theory of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly outlines the basic tenets of the basic structure doctrine.
2. The judiciary plays a crucial role in identifying and defining the aspects of the Constitution that constitute its basic structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The theory of basic structure wasn't explicitly defined in the original Constitution.  It emerged from judicial pronouncements, primarily the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973). The Supreme Court established the principle that Parliament's amending power under Article 368 is not absolute and cannot alter the fundamental or basic features of the Constitution.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the basic structure doctrine is a judicial creation, not a constitutional provision. Statement 2 is correct because the judiciary, through its interpretation of various cases, has defined and refined the concept of the basic structure, determining which constitutional provisions are essential and inviolable.  The evolving nature of this doctrine underscores the judiciary's role in safeguarding the Constitution's core principles.  Subsequent judgments have further elaborated on this theory, leading to ongoing debates and interpretations.

**2. With reference to the amendments made to the Indian Constitution between 2000 and 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The high number of amendments during this period indicates a strong consensus among political parties on the need for constitutional reform.
2. The amendments passed during this period were largely non-controversial and did not face significant opposition.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A large number of constitutional amendments in a short period doesn't automatically imply consensus.  It could signify a dominant political party pushing through its agenda, or a period of intense political pressure for change, possibly with underlying disagreements. Statement 1 is incorrect because the sheer volume of amendments doesn't necessarily equate to consensus.  While some amendments might have enjoyed broad support, others might have been highly contested. Statement 2 is also incorrect;  a significant number of amendments, even if passed, often face opposition. The period 2000-2003 might have seen amendments that sparked considerable debate and controversy, even if ultimately approved.  Analyzing individual amendments and the surrounding political context is necessary to determine the level of consensus and controversy.

**3. With reference to the special majority required for amending the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The requirement of a special majority reflects a commitment to protect the Constitution's fundamental principles from hasty or ill-considered changes.
2. The special majority provision ensures that constitutional amendments are supported by a broad cross-section of political opinion, preventing amendments driven by narrow interests.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The special majority requirement for constitutional amendments (Article 368) serves multiple purposes. It's designed to prevent easy alterations to the fundamental framework of the nation.  Statement 1 is correct: The higher threshold for passage makes it more difficult to amend the Constitution, thereby safeguarding its core principles from impulsive or poorly conceived changes.  This requirement reflects the Constitution's importance and permanence. Statement 2 is also correct: Requiring a significant majority ensures that amendments enjoy considerable support across the political spectrum, reducing the likelihood of amendments being driven by the interests of a single party or faction. This promotes broader acceptance and legitimacy for constitutional changes.  However, the effectiveness of this mechanism in achieving these goals remains a subject of debate.


**4. With reference to the unrepresentative nature of the Indian Constitution's making, consider the following statements:**

1. The absence of direct participation by a significant portion of the Indian population in the Constituent Assembly renders the Constitution inherently unrepresentative.
2. The Constitution's unrepresentative nature is mitigated by its subsequent evolution through amendments and judicial interpretations, reflecting the changing needs and aspirations of the people.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constituent Assembly, while striving for inclusivity, did not represent all sections of Indian society equally.  Statement 1 is correct: The Assembly's composition, with limited representation of women, marginalized communities, and certain regions, raises questions about its fully representative nature.  This limited representation at the time of drafting could be seen as a shortcoming. However, Statement 2 is also correct: The Constitution, as a living document, has evolved through amendments and judicial interpretations, reflecting the evolving social and political landscape of India.  These changes have addressed some of the initial shortcomings in representation, making the Constitution more responsive to the needs of the people over time.  The ongoing process of amendment and interpretation helps to bridge the gap between the initial limitations of the Constituent Assembly and the diverse needs of a modern India.


**5. With reference to gender justice in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution's initial provisions inadequately addressed gender inequality within the family structure.
2.  Subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations have completely eradicated gender-based discrimination in all aspects of Indian society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination based on sex (Article 15), its initial provisions did not fully address the deep-rooted gender inequalities prevalent in Indian society, particularly within the family. Statement 1 is correct:  The Constitution's focus on formal equality didn't adequately tackle issues like unequal property rights, gender-based violence, and discriminatory practices within families. Statement 2 is incorrect:  While subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations have made significant progress in addressing gender inequality, complete eradication of gender-based discrimination in all spheres of Indian society is yet to be achieved.  The ongoing struggle for gender justice highlights the need for continuous reform and change.


**6. With reference to the placement of socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles rather than Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decision to place socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the limited resources and developmental challenges facing India at the time of independence.
2.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles allows for greater flexibility in policy-making, enabling the government to adapt its approach to socio-economic issues based on changing circumstances and priorities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The framing of the Indian Constitution involved strategic choices regarding the categorization of rights.  Statement 1 is correct:  The inclusion of socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles (Part IV) rather than Fundamental Rights (Part III) reflects a considered decision. The Constituent Assembly recognized the immediate need to address fundamental rights like freedom of speech and religion, which were crucial for establishing a democratic system.  However, the implementation of socio-economic rights required substantial resources and long-term planning, which were constrained by India's post-independence context.  Statement 2 is also correct: The non-justiciable nature of Directive Principles provides flexibility.  It allows the government to prioritize and implement socio-economic policies based on the nation's evolving economic capabilities and social needs, without the immediate legal constraint of judicial enforcement.  This approach balances the ideal of a welfare state with the practical realities of resource allocation and developmental challenges.


**7. With reference to the basic structure doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The basic structure doctrine limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2. The basic structure doctrine empowers the judiciary to review and invalidate constitutional amendments that violate the core principles of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The basic structure doctrine, established by the Supreme Court, significantly impacts the amending power of the Parliament. Statement 1 is correct: This doctrine acts as a limitation on Parliament's otherwise extensive power to amend the Constitution under Article 368.  It prevents the alteration or destruction of the fundamental framework of the Constitution, preserving its core principles. Statement 2 is also correct:  The doctrine empowers the judiciary to review constitutional amendments. If an amendment is found to violate the basic structure, the Court can strike it down, ensuring the Constitution's integrity. This judicial review is a crucial safeguard against any attempt to fundamentally alter the nation's constitutional framework through amendments.  The ongoing debates surrounding the scope and application of the basic structure doctrine highlight its importance in the Indian constitutional landscape.


**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution's preamble, consider the following statements:**

1. The preamble asserts that the Constitution is a product of the collective will of the people of India.
2. The preamble explicitly lays down the various objectives of the Constitution, providing a framework for its interpretation and implementation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The preamble of the Indian Constitution serves as a concise statement of its fundamental principles and goals.  Statement 1 is correct: The opening words "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA..." clearly establish that the Constitution is not imposed but is rather a product of the people's collective will and consent. This signifies the democratic foundation of the Constitution and its legitimacy as an expression of popular sovereignty. Statement 2 is also correct: The preamble also outlines the objectives of the Constitution – to secure a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic; to ensure justice (social, economic, and political); to provide liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; to guarantee equality of status and opportunity; and to promote fraternity, ensuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. These objectives provide a guiding framework for interpreting and implementing the Constitution's provisions.  The preamble's significance lies in its ability to provide a concise and powerful summary of the Constitution's core ideals.


**9. With reference to the limitations of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution's centralized structure has hindered the development of regional autonomy and self-governance.
2. The Constitution's failure to adequately address socio-economic rights has led to persistent inequalities and social injustice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution, while a landmark achievement, has faced criticisms regarding certain aspects of its design and implementation. Statement 1 is correct: The Constitution's emphasis on a strong central government has been criticized for potentially hindering the development of regional autonomy and self-governance.  Concerns about the balance between central authority and regional needs have been raised, particularly in the context of diverse linguistic and cultural identities within India.  Statement 2 is also correct: The placement of socio-economic rights primarily within the Directive Principles of State Policy, rather than as enforceable Fundamental Rights, has been criticized for contributing to persistent social and economic inequalities.  The non-justiciable nature of Directive Principles has hampered their effective implementation, leading to calls for greater emphasis on ensuring socio-economic justice.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution's philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution's philosophy emphasizes the importance of balancing individual rights with collective responsibilities.
2.  The Constitution's philosophy is static and unchanging, reflecting the values and beliefs of the time of its drafting.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The philosophical underpinnings of the Indian Constitution are complex and multifaceted. Statement 1 is correct:  The Constitution seeks to balance individual freedoms (Fundamental Rights) with the collective good (Directive Principles of State Policy).  This balance is essential for a functioning democracy; individual liberties must be exercised responsibly, considering their impact on society.  The Constitution aims to create a society where individual rights and collective responsibilities coexist and reinforce each other. Statement 2 is incorrect: The Constitution's philosophy is not static. It has evolved through judicial interpretations, constitutional amendments, and societal changes.  The Constitution's adaptability and capacity for evolution are vital for its continued relevance in a dynamic society.  The ongoing debates and interpretations of the Constitution reflect its dynamic nature and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances.


**11. With reference to the Indian Constitution's approach to secularism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution adopts a concept of secularism that emphasizes the state's neutrality towards religion.
2. The Indian Constitution's approach to secularism involves promoting religious tolerance and equality among all religions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's approach to secularism is distinct from the Western model of strict separation of religion and state. Statement 1 is correct:  The Indian Constitution promotes state neutrality towards religion, preventing the establishment of an official state religion. This principle of secularism ensures that all religions are treated equally and prevents state interference in religious matters. Statement 2 is also correct:  Beyond neutrality, the Indian Constitution actively promotes religious tolerance and equality.  It guarantees the freedom to practice and propagate one's religion, while simultaneously protecting religious minorities and preventing discrimination based on religion. The Constitution's provisions related to religious freedom, minority rights, and the prohibition of religious discrimination reflect this proactive approach to promoting religious harmony and equality.


**12. With reference to the concept of liberty in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Liberty, as understood in the Indian Constitution, encompasses both negative and positive aspects, including the freedom from state interference and the right to positive freedoms such as education and healthcare.
2. The Indian Constitution's concept of liberty is absolute and unrestricted, safeguarding individual autonomy without any limitations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution's understanding of liberty is nuanced and multifaceted. Statement 1 is correct:  Liberty in the Indian context is not merely the absence of state interference (negative liberty) but also includes the provision of positive freedoms that enable individuals to fully develop their potential.  While the Constitution guarantees fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and religion (negative liberties), it also promotes socio-economic rights through the Directive Principles of State Policy (positive liberties), acknowledging that genuine liberty requires access to basic necessities and opportunities. Statement 2 is incorrect:  The Constitution's concept of liberty is not absolute.  Fundamental rights are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, and other legitimate state concerns.  This balance between individual liberty and the collective good is central to the Indian Constitution's approach to safeguarding fundamental rights.


**13.  With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Election Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is an independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections.
2. The Election Commission's decisions are not subject to judicial review.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a vital role in India's democratic process. Statement 1 is correct: The ECI is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections to the Parliament, state legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.  Its independence is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.  The ECI enjoys considerable autonomy in its functioning, though ultimately accountable to Parliament. Statement 2 is incorrect:  While the ECI's decisions carry significant weight, they are not entirely immune to judicial review.  The courts can review the ECI's actions if they are found to be arbitrary, unreasonable, or violate fundamental rights.  This judicial oversight helps to maintain the balance between the ECI's autonomy and the need for accountability within the framework of the rule of law.


**14. With reference to the President's rule (Article 356) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed only if there is a complete breakdown of constitutional machinery in a state.
2. The imposition of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 356 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to impose President's rule in a state under specific circumstances. Statement 1 is correct:  The President's rule, also known as the state emergency, can be imposed if there is a failure of constitutional machinery in a state. This typically involves a situation where the state government is unable to function effectively or maintain law and order.  However, the grounds for imposing President's rule have been subject to judicial scrutiny and interpretation. Statement 2 is incorrect: While the imposition of President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it is not mandatory.  The decision to dissolve the assembly rests with the President, and the circumstances may warrant keeping the assembly in place.  The use of Article 356 has been controversial, with concerns raised about its potential misuse for political purposes.


**15. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indian federalism is characterized by a strong central government with significant powers, leading to concerns about the erosion of states' autonomy.
2.  The Indian Constitution's federal structure is rigid and inflexible, making it difficult to adapt to changing circumstances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian federal system is a unique blend of federal and unitary features. Statement 1 is correct:  The Indian Constitution establishes a federal structure but with a strong central government.  The Union List contains subjects of national importance under the exclusive jurisdiction of the central government, while the Concurrent List allows both the Centre and states to legislate on certain matters. This concentration of power at the Centre has raised concerns about the erosion of state autonomy and the potential for central dominance. Statement 2 is incorrect:  The Indian Constitution's federal structure is not rigid.  It has undergone significant changes through constitutional amendments, reflecting its capacity to adapt to evolving circumstances.  The flexibility of the Constitution's federal framework is evident in its ability to accommodate new states, redistribute powers, and respond to changing political and social dynamics.


**16. With reference to the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Question Hour provides a mechanism for Parliament to scrutinize the Council of Ministers' actions and policies.
2. The no-confidence motion is a tool that Parliament can utilize to remove the Council of Ministers from power.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian parliamentary system emphasizes the accountability of the executive (Council of Ministers) to the legislature (Parliament). Statement 1 is correct: Question Hour is a crucial tool for parliamentary oversight.  Members of Parliament (MPs) can question ministers about government policies, actions, and expenditures.  This mechanism enables scrutiny of the executive's performance and holds it accountable to the legislature. Statement 2 is also correct:  The no-confidence motion is a powerful instrument available to the Lok Sabha (Lower House) to express its lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers.  If the motion is passed by a majority, the government must resign. This mechanism ensures that the government remains responsible to the elected representatives of the people.


**17. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the Council of Ministers.
2. Private member's bills have never been passed into law in the history of the Indian Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Private member's bills are introduced by MPs who are not ministers. Statement 1 is correct:  Any MP, whether from the ruling party or opposition, can introduce a private member's bill.  However, such bills face significant challenges in getting passed due to the government's agenda and priorities.  Private member's bills often address specific issues or concerns that the government may not prioritize. Statement 2 is incorrect: While private member's bills are less likely to be passed than government bills, they have been passed into law on several occasions in the history of the Indian Parliament. Though rare, these instances demonstrate the potential for backbenchers to influence legislation.


**18. With reference to the parliamentary form of government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive branch (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the legislature (Parliament).
2. The head of the government (Prime Minister) is directly elected by the people.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian parliamentary system is characterized by a close relationship between the executive and the legislature.  Statement 1 is correct:  The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (Lower House).  This means that the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power.  The no-confidence motion is a key mechanism enforcing this accountability. Statement 2 is incorrect: The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the people.  The Prime Minister is the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then forms the Council of Ministers.


**19. With reference to the Cabinet form of government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet form of government ensures collective responsibility of the ministers to the Parliament.
2. The Cabinet form of government ensures that the executive branch is independent of the legislative branch.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet form of government is a central feature of India's parliamentary system. Statement 1 is correct:  Collective responsibility implies that all ministers are collectively responsible for the government's actions and policies.  If a minister disagrees with a government decision, they must either resign or accept the decision.  This principle promotes unity and coordination within the government. Statement 2 is incorrect: The Cabinet form of government does not ensure independence of the executive from the legislature.  Instead, it emphasizes the close relationship between the two, with the executive being responsible to the legislature.  The executive branch is accountable to the Parliament, and its actions are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and control.


**20. With reference to judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review allows the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.
2. Judicial review empowers the judiciary to question the wisdom or effectiveness of laws enacted by the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Judicial review is a fundamental feature of the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct:  The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to review laws passed by the Parliament and state legislatures, as well as government actions, to determine whether they conform to the Constitution's provisions. If a law or action is found to be unconstitutional, the Court can declare it void.  This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and safeguarding constitutional principles. Statement 2 is incorrect:  Judicial review is primarily concerned with the constitutionality (legal validity) of laws and actions, not their wisdom or effectiveness.  The judiciary does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature on matters of policy or expediency, focusing instead on ensuring the legality of government actions within the constitutional framework.


**21. With reference to the relationship between law and liberty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The absence of laws can lead to a state of anarchy, undermining liberty.
2.  Excessive laws and regulations can restrict individual freedoms, thereby limiting liberty.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The relationship between law and liberty is a complex one, involving a delicate balance. Statement 1 is correct:  The rule of law is essential for maintaining order and security in society.  Without laws and a system for their enforcement, a state of anarchy could prevail, making it impossible to exercise freedoms and liberties.  A functioning legal system is therefore necessary to protect individual rights and freedoms. Statement 2 is also correct:  Excessive laws and regulations, while aiming to maintain order, can unduly restrict individual freedoms.  Such over-regulation can stifle initiative, creativity, and personal autonomy, leading to a reduction in liberty.  The ideal relationship involves a balance between maintaining order and protecting individual freedoms, requiring carefully crafted laws that respect fundamental rights.


**22. With reference to the concept of equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1. Equality implies the absence of privileges or special advantages for certain groups.
2. Equality necessitates the complete absence of competition among individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The concept of equality is a fundamental principle in democratic societies. Statement 1 is correct:  Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws (Article 14 of the Indian Constitution) imply that all individuals are subject to the same laws and should not enjoy special privileges or advantages based on their social status, caste, religion, or other factors.  The principle of equality aims to create a level playing field where everyone has equal opportunities. Statement 2 is incorrect:  Equality does not require the total absence of competition.  Competition is a natural aspect of human interaction and can be a driving force for innovation and progress.  However, the competition must be fair and not based on factors that undermine equality of opportunity, such as discrimination or unequal access to resources.  The goal of equality is to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to compete, regardless of their background or social standing.


**23. With reference to the residuary powers in the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. Residuary powers were vested with the Governor-General.
2. The Government of India Act of 1935 established a federal structure with clear division of powers between the Centre and the provinces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced significant changes to India's constitutional framework. Statement 1 is correct:  The Act vested residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to either the Centre or provinces) with the Governor-General, highlighting the strong centralizing tendency of the Act.  This centralized control over residuary powers limited the autonomy of the provinces. Statement 2 is partially correct: While the Act attempted to establish a federal structure, it was not a truly symmetrical federation. The Act established a federation with three lists (Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent), but the significant residuary powers vested with the Governor-General tilted the balance towards the Centre, undermining the intended federal balance.


**24. With reference to Aadhaar card in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar card serves as proof of citizenship.
2. The Aadhaar number, once issued, cannot be deactivated.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar is a biometric identification system in India. Statement 1 is incorrect:  While Aadhaar is widely used for identification purposes and various government services, it does not, in itself, serve as proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes. Aadhaar primarily serves as a unique identification number, linking individuals to various databases for efficient service delivery. Statement 2 is incorrect:  The Aadhaar number can be deactivated or updated under certain circumstances, such as changes in personal information or suspected fraudulent activity.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has established mechanisms for managing Aadhaar data and ensuring its accuracy and security.


**25. With reference to the right to privacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21).
2. The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Indian Constitution.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The right to privacy is a significant aspect of fundamental rights in India. Statement 1 is correct:  The Supreme Court of India, in the Puttaswamy case (2017), recognized the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty). This landmark judgment established the right to privacy as a fundamental right, protecting individuals from unwarranted state intrusion into their personal lives. Statement 2 is incorrect: The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  It emerged through judicial interpretation, with the Supreme Court recognizing it as a fundamental right inherent in Article 21.  The evolution of the right to privacy through judicial pronouncements highlights the dynamic nature of constitutional interpretation in India.


**26. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The electoral college for the Presidential election includes members of both Houses of Parliament and state legislative assemblies.
2. The value of each vote cast by an MLA is uniform across all states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President of India is elected through an indirect electoral college. Statement 1 is correct: The electoral college comprises elected members of both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and the state legislative assemblies.  Each member of the electoral college has a weighted vote, with the value of an MLA's vote varying based on the state's population. Statement 2 is incorrect: The value of each vote cast by an MLA is not uniform across all states.  The value is calculated based on the state's population, with more populous states having MLAs with higher vote values.  This system ensures that the representation of different states in the Presidential election reflects their relative population sizes.


**27. With reference to the Governor of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution during their term of office.
2. The emoluments and allowances of the Governor cannot be diminished during their term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state in India holds a significant constitutional position. Statement 1 is correct:  The Governor enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution during their term of office.  This protection is intended to ensure the Governor's impartiality and prevent political interference in their functions.  However, this immunity does not extend to actions committed before assuming office or after leaving office. Statement 2 is also correct: The emoluments and allowances of the Governor cannot be diminished during their term of office.  This provision safeguards the Governor's financial security and independence from political influence.  It ensures that the Governor's salary and benefits remain stable throughout their tenure.


**28. With reference to the parliamentary committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes the executive's exercise of delegated legislative powers.
2. The Public Accounts Committee examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary committees play a vital role in overseeing the executive branch in India. Statement 1 is correct: The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines whether the executive branch is exercising delegated legislative powers (the power to make regulations, rules, etc. under laws passed by Parliament) within the limits set by Parliament.  It ensures that the executive doesn't exceed its delegated powers. Statement 2 is also correct: The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's audit reports on government spending.  The CAG audits government accounts to ensure financial propriety and legality.  The PAC scrutinizes these reports and holds the executive accountable for any irregularities or inefficiencies.


**29. With reference to the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker vacates their office if they cease to be a member of the Assembly.
2. The Speaker automatically vacates their office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly presides over the Assembly's proceedings. Statement 1 is correct: The Speaker's position is closely linked to their membership in the Assembly.  If the Speaker ceases to be a member of the Assembly (e.g., through resignation, disqualification, or defeat in an election), they automatically vacate the Speaker's office.  This ensures that the Speaker maintains their legitimacy and continues to represent the Assembly. Statement 2 is incorrect:  The dissolution of the Assembly does not automatically vacate the Speaker's office.  While the Speaker's term ends with the dissolution of the Assembly, they continue to hold the office until a new Assembly is constituted and a new Speaker is elected.


**30. With reference to the consequences of the President's rule (Article 356) in a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The imposition of

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, is applicable only to individuals affected by land acquisition for projects and not to involuntary displacement due to other reasons.
2. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment formulated the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007,  addresses involuntary displacement due to various reasons, not just land acquisition for projects.  The policy aims to provide a comprehensive framework for rehabilitation and resettlement for all those displaced due to development projects, regardless of the specific cause of displacement.  It covers a broad spectrum of displacement scenarios, encompassing those affected by large-scale projects, such as dams, mines, and industries, as well as those displaced due to other development initiatives.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, was formulated by the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  The Ministry of Rural Development plays a pivotal role in rural development initiatives, and this policy falls under its purview due to its direct impact on rural populations and livelihoods affected by displacement. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment focuses on the welfare of marginalized groups, which may include some displaced individuals but is not the primary ministry responsible for the policy.


**2. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to the Parliament.
2.  All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Contingency Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Department of Economic Affairs, under the Ministry of Finance, is primarily responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to the Parliament.  The Department of Revenue is involved in tax collection and administration but doesn't lead the budget preparation process. The Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in formulating fiscal policy, analyzing economic trends, and coordinating budgetary allocations across various government departments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. All revenues received by the Union Government by way of taxes and other receipts are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India, not the Contingency Fund of India. The Consolidated Fund is the primary account for government receipts and is subject to parliamentary appropriation. The Contingency Fund is a separate fund used for unforeseen expenditures, requiring subsequent parliamentary approval for any withdrawals.


**3. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission facilitates the proper distribution of finances among Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's mandate focuses on Centre-State financial relations and does not encompass the distribution of finances among PSUs. The Finance Commission's primary responsibility is to review the financial resources available to the Union and State governments, recommend the distribution of tax proceeds between them, and suggest grants-in-aid to States.  The allocation of resources among PSUs falls under the purview of the respective ministries and government departments responsible for overseeing those entities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the government.  While the government generally accepts the recommendations, it is not obligated to do so.  The recommendations hold significant weight due to the Commission's expertise and the constitutional mandate for its establishment, but ultimately, the government retains the authority to make the final decisions on financial allocations.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a five-member body.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a five-member body; it is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  While the ECI may have other election commissioners assisting the Chief Election Commissioner, the ultimate authority rests with the Chief Election Commissioner.  The composition of the ECI has undergone changes over time, and currently, it operates with a single Chief Election Commissioner.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India itself decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections, not the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.  The ECI is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.  It enjoys autonomy in determining election dates, overseeing the electoral process, and resolving election-related disputes.  The Ministry of Home Affairs plays a supporting role but doesn't have the authority to decide the election schedule.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is a bill presented by a Member of Parliament who is not elected but only nominated by the President of India.
2. Recently, a private member's bill has been passed in the Parliament of India for the first time in its history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament (MP) who is elected, not nominated.  Any elected MP can introduce a private member's bill, regardless of their party affiliation.  Nominated members of Parliament do not have the same rights as elected members in this regard. Private members' bills are often introduced to address specific issues or concerns not covered by government legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While private member's bills are rarely passed, it is not accurate to say that one has never been passed in the history of the Indian Parliament.  Although private member's bills face significant challenges in getting passed due to limited parliamentary time and the government's legislative agenda, there have been instances in the past where such bills have been passed into law. The statement presents an oversimplification of the legislative process and the success rate of private member's bills.


**6. With reference to the President of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can make laws relating to a State under Article 356.
2.  The President can suspend the enforcement of Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 and 21) under Article 358.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Under Article 356 (President's Rule), when a state's government cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution, the President can assume the powers of the state legislature and even issue ordinances or enact laws on behalf of the state.  This is a significant power used in exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 358 relates to the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency, not Article 359.  Article 359 allows for the suspension of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency. Article 358 deals with the suspension of certain rights related to freedom of movement and communication.  The President does not have the power to unilaterally suspend Fundamental Rights under Article 358.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. The "Instrument of Instructions" contained in the Government of India Act, 1935, were incorporated into the Constitution of India in 1950 as Fundamental Rights.
2. The authorization for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India must come from the Union Finance Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Instrument of Instructions" from the Government of India Act, 1935, were incorporated into the Indian Constitution as Directive Principles of State Policy, not Fundamental Rights.  These instructions, which provided guidance to the Governor-General on matters of governance, were deemed more suitable for influencing government policy than for being legally enforceable Fundamental Rights.  The Directive Principles aim to guide the state towards social and economic justice, reflecting the broader goals of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The authorization for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India must come from the Parliament of India, not the Union Finance Minister.  The Parliament's approval is essential for all government expenditures from the Consolidated Fund.  While the Union Finance Minister plays a crucial role in budget preparation and presentation, the final authority for approving expenditures rests with the Parliament.  This reflects the principle of parliamentary sovereignty in financial matters.


**8. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats have jurisdiction to settle matters at the pre-litigative stage and not those pending before any court.
2. Lok Adalats can deal with matters that are civil in nature but not criminal in nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Adalats can settle matters at both the pre-litigative and litigative stages.  They can resolve disputes that have not yet been filed in court, as well as cases already pending before various courts. Lok Adalats offer a quicker and less expensive alternative to formal court proceedings.  Their jurisdiction extends to resolving disputes at various stages of the legal process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lok Adalats can deal with both civil and some categories of compoundable criminal matters.  While their primary focus is on civil disputes, Lok Adalats also have the power to resolve certain types of criminal cases that are compoundable, meaning they can be settled out of court with the consent of the parties involved.  This expands their scope to address a wider range of legal issues.


**9. With reference to the Consumer Disputes Redressal at the district level in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A State Government can establish more than one District Forum in a district if it deems fit.
2. The District Forum entertains complaints where the value of goods or services does not exceed rupees fifty lakhs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Consumer Protection Act allows state governments to establish more than one District Forum within a district if they deem it necessary to ensure efficient and accessible consumer redressal mechanisms.  This is particularly relevant in large and populous districts where a single forum might be overburdened. The flexibility in establishing multiple forums aims to enhance the reach and effectiveness of consumer protection measures.

Statement 2 is correct.  District Forums are empowered to entertain complaints where the value of goods or services involved does not exceed a specified monetary limit (currently, it is more than fifty lakhs).  This limit helps delineate the jurisdiction of District Forums from State and National Commissions, which handle cases involving higher values.  This tiered system ensures that consumer disputes are addressed at the appropriate level of authority and prevents overburdening of higher-level commissions.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

1. In India, taxes on transactions in Stock Exchanges and Futures Markets are levied by the Union.
2. The State Finance Commission makes recommendations to the Governor of a State as to the principles for determining the taxes and duties which may be appropriated by the Panchayats in that particular State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In India, taxes on securities transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets are levied by the Union government, not the state governments.  This is a key aspect of the Union's power to levy taxes on transactions related to financial markets.  This falls under the Union's power to levy taxes under the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The State Finance Commission is responsible for making recommendations to the Governor of a state on the principles for determining taxes and duties that can be appropriated by Panchayats within that state. This is a crucial function of the State Finance Commission in ensuring that local governments have adequate financial resources for their activities.  The recommendations aim to ensure equitable distribution of resources and promote financial autonomy of Panchayats.


**11. With reference to the Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act, 1992, consider the following statements:**

1. It provides for the constitution of District Planning Committees.
2. It mandates State Election Commissions to conduct all panchayat elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 introduced provisions for the establishment of District Planning Committees (DPCs) to ensure that planning processes at the district level consider the needs and priorities of local communities.  The DPCs were intended to strengthen participatory planning and development.  The DPCs are crucial in bridging the gap between national and local level planning.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 mandates the establishment of State Election Commissions (SECs) to conduct panchayat elections independently and impartially.  This provision aimed to ensure free and fair elections at the local level.  The independence of SECs is critical in promoting democratic processes and preventing political interference. The SECs ensure that elections are conducted according to the law and standards.


**12. With reference to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, consider the following statements:**

1. It was enacted in consonance with the Right to Healthy Environment, construed as a part of Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
2. It provides environmental justice and helps reduce the burden of litigation in higher courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted to provide a specialized and effective mechanism for addressing environmental issues, recognizing the importance of a healthy environment as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.  This reflects the evolving judicial interpretation of environmental rights as human rights.  The Act reinforces the constitutional commitment to environmental protection.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT's primary function is to provide environmental justice by offering a speedy and specialized mechanism for resolving environmental disputes, thereby reducing the burden on higher courts.  This specialized tribunal is intended to resolve environmental cases efficiently and effectively, reducing the backlog of cases in the higher judiciary. The NGT's establishment reflects a commitment to effective environmental governance.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar card can be used as proof of citizenship or domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or omitted by the issuing authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Aadhaar card is primarily a proof of identity and address, not proof of citizenship or domicile.  While it can be used as supporting evidence for various purposes, it does not inherently establish citizenship or domicile status.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal provisions, and domicile is defined differently depending on the context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  An Aadhaar number can be deactivated or omitted under certain circumstances, such as detection of fraudulent activity or upon the request of the individual. The Aadhaar issuing authority has the power to take action against fraudulent Aadhaar cards. The Aadhaar system includes mechanisms for addressing errors or concerns with Aadhaar data.


**14. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Right to Privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 17 of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that the laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are open to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Right to Privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21, not Article 17. Article 17 deals with the abolition of untouchability, which is a separate and distinct fundamental right.  The Supreme Court has recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right flowing from Article 21.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, in its landmark judgment, ruled that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.  This decision limited the extent to which the Ninth Schedule could be used to shield laws from judicial scrutiny.  The ruling aimed to maintain the balance between legislative power and judicial review.  This is a significant development concerning the scope of judicial review in India.


**15.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The 44th Amendment to the Constitution of India introduced an Article placing the election of the Prime Minister beyond judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court of India struck down the 99th Amendment to the Constitution of India as being violative of the independence of the judiciary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 44th Amendment did not introduce any article placing the election of the Prime Minister beyond judicial review. The process of electing the Prime Minister is governed by established constitutional and parliamentary procedures, which are subject to judicial review if challenged on constitutional grounds.  The 44th Amendment focused primarily on other aspects of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India did strike down a part of the 99th Amendment to the Constitution, which related to the appointment of judges to the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), as it deemed it to be violative of the independence of the judiciary.  The Supreme Court's decision upheld the importance of an independent judiciary and the existing collegium system for judicial appointments.  The judgment emphasized the separation of powers and the need to protect judicial independence.


**16. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament of India can place a particular law in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India.
2. The validity of a law placed in the Ninth Schedule cannot be examined by any court, and no judgment can be made on it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament of India does have the power to include laws in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  This power was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial review.  However, the scope and implications of this power have been subject to significant judicial scrutiny.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially laws in the Ninth Schedule were largely immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has since clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has ruled that even laws in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution.  This landmark judgment significantly altered the understanding of the Ninth Schedule's protective scope.  The "basic structure" doctrine limits the extent to which Parliament can amend fundamental aspects of the Constitution.


**17. With reference to the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tenth Schedule was added by the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 and is also known as the Anti-Defection Law.
2. The Tenth Schedule specifies the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, dealing with anti-defection, was added to the Constitution by the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985.  This law aims to curb the practice of legislators changing their party affiliations for personal or political gain.  The anti-defection law seeks to maintain stability in governments and prevent horse-trading.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Tenth Schedule deals with disqualification of Members of Parliament and State Legislatures on grounds of defection, not the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats. The Eleventh Schedule addresses Panchayats' powers and responsibilities.  The Tenth Schedule focuses on maintaining the stability of political parties and preventing political instability.


**18. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India guarantees equality of opportunity to all citizens of India in matters relating to public employment under Article 15.
2. The First Constitution Amendment Bill, passed in 1951, was related to the protection of agrarian reforms in certain States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution of India guarantees equality of opportunity in matters relating to public employment under Article 16, not Article 15. Article 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Article 16 specifically addresses equality of opportunity in public employment.

Statement 2 is correct. The First Constitution Amendment Bill, passed in 1951, was primarily aimed at protecting agrarian reforms enacted by various states. The amendment was a response to judicial challenges to land reform legislation, seeking to uphold the government's policy of redistributing land for social and economic justice.


**19. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. No High Court shall have the jurisdiction to declare any central law to be constitutionally invalid.
2. An amendment to the Constitution of India cannot be called into question by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. High Courts do have the jurisdiction to declare central laws constitutionally invalid if they are found to violate the Constitution. However, their decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court.  The judicial review power is distributed among courts, with the Supreme Court having ultimate authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While amendments to the Constitution are generally considered final, the Supreme Court can review them to determine whether they violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution.  The "basic structure" doctrine limits the amending power of Parliament and protects fundamental features of the Constitution.  Judicial review thus acts as a check on the amending process.


**20. With reference to Article 142 of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The decisions taken by the Election Commission of India while discharging its duties cannot be challenged in any court of law.
2. The Supreme Court of India is not constrained in the exercise of its powers by laws made by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Decisions of the Election Commission of India, while generally not easily challenged, are not entirely beyond the purview of judicial review. While the ECI's independence is crucial, courts can still intervene if there is a demonstrable violation of fundamental rights or procedural impropriety.  The courts maintain a role in ensuring that even independent bodies operate within constitutional boundaries.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 142 grants the Supreme Court wide discretionary powers to do complete justice in any case before it, which means that it is not bound by ordinary laws made by Parliament in exercising its powers.  This power is exceptional and is used to ensure justice in cases where ordinary legal processes might be inadequate.  This power underscores the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guarantor of justice.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising a single Chief Election Commissioner and a maximum of two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) consists of the Chief Election Commissioner and a maximum of two other Election Commissioners, all appointed by the President of India.  The number of Election Commissioners can be varied by the President depending on the workload and the need for additional expertise. The Commission functions as a collegium, with decisions often reached through consensus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body, is solely responsible for deciding the election schedule for all elections (general and by-elections) at both the national and state levels. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does not have any role in this function. The ECI's independence is crucial to ensure free and fair elections.  Its decisions regarding election schedules are not subject to government interference.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can impose President's rule only upon a report from the Governor of the State concerned.
2.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 356 of the Indian Constitution allows the President to impose President's rule in a state, but only on the basis of a report from the Governor of that state. This report must indicate a failure of the constitutional machinery in the state. The Governor's report is, however, not binding on the President. The President can act on their own discretion, albeit with consultation with the Union Cabinet.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an automatic consequence. The President has the discretion to dissolve the assembly or allow it to continue functioning under President's rule.  The decision to dissolve the assembly depends on the specific circumstances and the advice of the Union Cabinet.


**3. With reference to the Indian Federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution explicitly defines the distribution of powers between the Centre and the States and leaves no residuary powers.
2. The Rajya Sabha provides equal representation to all States, irrespective of their population size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does distribute powers between the Centre and the States through lists (Union List, State List, Concurrent List). However, it also includes a provision for residuary powers, which are vested in the Union Parliament.  This means any subject not explicitly mentioned in the lists falls under the Union's legislative competence.  This feature reflects a tilt towards a unitary system within the federal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha, the Council of States, does not provide equal representation to all States. While it aims to represent the States, the number of seats allocated to each State is based on its population, though not in direct proportion.  Larger states have a greater number of representatives in the Rajya Sabha compared to smaller states.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1. A private member's bill is a bill introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the Council of Ministers.
2.  A Money Bill can originate only in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is defined as a bill introduced in Parliament by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.  These bills often deal with issues of public interest not directly addressed by the government's legislative agenda.  While passing private member's bills is rare, the provision itself highlights the participation of individual MPs in law-making.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  According to Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, a Money Bill can originate only in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final say in the passage of a Money Bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power over financial matters.


**5. With reference to the functions of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament exercises control over the executive through the Question Hour and the No-Confidence Motion.
2. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a special majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament uses several tools to exercise control over the executive branch, including the Question Hour (where ministers answer questions from MPs), and the No-Confidence Motion (which can lead to the downfall of the government). These mechanisms ensure executive accountability to the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Parliament possesses the power to amend any part of the Constitution. While certain amendments require a special majority (two-thirds of members present and voting in each House), the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is broadly acknowledged, including the ability to amend provisions related to Fundamental Rights.  However, the "basic structure" doctrine, as established by the Supreme Court, imposes limits on the extent of permissible amendments.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning that they are enforceable in courts of law.
2. The Fundamental Rights can be suspended during a National Emergency, except for Articles 20 and 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable.  While they are considered fundamental in the governance of the country and guide the state's actions, they are not directly enforceable in courts.  They represent aspirational goals for the state rather than legally guaranteed rights for citizens.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 358 and 359 of the Indian Constitution allow for the suspension of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency, except for Articles 20 (protection in respect of conviction for offences) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty).  This exception underscores the importance of these rights, even in times of national crisis.


**7. With reference to the Indian Judicial System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Government of India and one or more states.
2. The High Courts in India can declare a law passed by the Parliament to be unconstitutional.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India, as per Article 131 of the Constitution, has original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Government of India and one or more states, or between the Government of India and any state or states on one side and one or more other states on the other. This original jurisdiction is a significant aspect of the Supreme Court's role in maintaining federal balance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  High Courts in India, as part of their judicial review power, possess the authority to declare a law passed by the Parliament to be unconstitutional if it violates the provisions of the Constitution. This power is crucial for upholding the supremacy of the Constitution and ensuring the rule of law.  However, their decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments and submits reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India, but unlike many other appointees, the CAG enjoys a fixed tenure (six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier) and can only be removed from office through a process similar to that for removing a Supreme Court judge.  This ensures their independence and objectivity in auditing government accounts.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  Their reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively, providing crucial oversight on public finances.  This function is critical for maintaining financial accountability and transparency in government operations.


**9. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented by the Finance Minister in both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Appropriation Bill, which authorizes the government to spend the money allocated in the budget, must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) by the Finance Minister.  After it is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is then presented to the Rajya Sabha for consideration.  While the Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments, it cannot reject a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Appropriation Bill, a crucial part of the budget process, authorizes the government to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for various expenditures.  This bill must be passed by both Houses of Parliament to ensure parliamentary approval for government spending.  Failure to pass the Appropriation Bill can lead to a constitutional crisis.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor cannot be removed from office except through impeachment by the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, though this power is typically exercised with caution and after consultation with the Union Cabinet.  The Governor's position is largely appointive and not directly elected by the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor can be removed from office by the President, but not through impeachment by the State Legislature.  The process for removing a Governor involves the President acting on the advice of the Union Cabinet.  There is no provision for impeachment of the Governor by the State Legislature.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act, 1935:**

1. It introduced the concept of Provincial Autonomy, dividing powers between the central and provincial governments.
2. It established a bicameral legislature at the Centre, comprising the Council of State and the Federal Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly reshaped the Indian political landscape.  Statement 1 is accurate; the Act introduced a system of Provincial Autonomy, granting significant legislative and administrative powers to the provinces. This marked a departure from the earlier centralized system and aimed to foster greater self-governance at the regional level.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Act established a bicameral legislature at the Centre, consisting of the Council of State (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House). This bicameral structure reflected the influence of the British parliamentary system and aimed to provide a more balanced and deliberative legislative process. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect as they only partially reflect the Act's provisions. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately represent key features of the 1935 Act.  The Act's provisions concerning the federal structure and legislative framework laid the groundwork for the future Constitution of India, although it was ultimately rejected by the Indian National Congress.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Amendment Act of 1951 to protect certain land reforms legislation from judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court's ruling in the *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* case (2007) clarified the scope of judicial review over laws included in the Ninth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ninth Schedule's history and legal interpretation. Statement 1 is correct:  The Ninth Schedule was indeed added to the Constitution via the First Amendment Act of 1951.  Its primary purpose was to shield certain land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, particularly challenges based on fundamental rights violations.  This was done to facilitate the implementation of crucial social and economic reforms.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Supreme Court's landmark judgment in *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu* significantly impacted the Ninth Schedule's legal standing.  While initially intended to protect laws from judicial review, the Court ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is entirely incorrect because both statements are factually accurate and relevant to understanding the Ninth Schedule's evolution and limitations.


**3. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts of law.
2. The DPSPs are derived from the Irish Constitution and aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Directive Principles of State Policy. Statement 1 correctly states that DPSPs are non-justiciable.  This means that citizens cannot directly sue the government for failing to implement them.  While not legally enforceable, they serve as guidelines for the government to formulate policies and laws aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  Statement 2 is also correct. The DPSPs draw inspiration from the Irish Constitution and embody the vision of a welfare state.  They outline the state's responsibility to promote social welfare, economic equality, and overall well-being of its citizens.  The welfare state ideal emphasizes the state's role in addressing social and economic inequalities and ensuring a minimum standard of living for all.  Options (a) and (b) are thus incorrect as they only address one aspect of the DPSPs, while option (d) is entirely false since both statements are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  While various articles indirectly protect aspects of privacy, there was no specific provision guaranteeing this right.  This led to extensive legal debate and judicial interpretation.  Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's landmark judgment in *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* (2017) unequivocally recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right, drawing upon various articles of the Constitution, particularly Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty).  The Court held that privacy is an intrinsic part of Article 21 and is essential for individual dignity and autonomy.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical context and legal evolution of the right to privacy in India.  The Court's decision in *Puttaswamy* significantly expanded the scope of fundamental rights and highlighted the evolving interpretation of the Constitution.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body with a Chief Election Commissioner and several Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the structure and functions of the Election Commission of India (ECI). Statement 1 is correct; the ECI comprises the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners. This multi-member structure ensures a collegial approach to decision-making and prevents any single individual from wielding excessive power.  Statement 2 is also correct; the ECI's primary responsibility is to conduct free and fair elections at various levels. This includes elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and the Presidential elections. The ECI's independence and impartiality are crucial for the health of India's democracy. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only address one aspect of the ECI's composition and role. Option (d) is entirely false because both statements are accurate and fundamental to understanding the ECI's structure and functions within India's electoral system.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.
2. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution provides for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils in certain states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate descriptions of the Indian Constitution's provisions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Statement 1 is correct; the Fifth Schedule outlines provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  These areas often have unique geographical and social characteristics, requiring specific administrative arrangements to protect the interests of tribal communities.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Sixth Schedule establishes Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in certain states in the Northeast, such as Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils are designed to grant greater autonomy to tribal communities within their respective districts, allowing them to manage their own affairs in accordance with their customs and traditions.  Options (a) and (b) are thus incomplete, while option (d) is entirely incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the specific roles of the Fifth and Sixth Schedules in safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Tribes in India.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a fixed term.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments and submits reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). Statement 1 is correct; the CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a fixed term, typically six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure ensures the CAG's independence and prevents political interference in the audit process.  Statement 2 is also correct; the CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of government finances and ensuring accountability and transparency.  These reports are submitted to the Parliament and State Legislatures, allowing elected representatives to scrutinize government spending and identify potential irregularities or inefficiencies. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect, and option (d) is false because both statements accurately reflect the CAG's appointment, tenure, and responsibilities in India's financial system.


**8. With reference to the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.
2.  Fundamental Duties are justiciable, meaning that their violation can be challenged in a court of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fundamental Duties were incorporated into the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  These duties aim to promote a sense of civic responsibility and national unity among citizens.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties are not justiciable. This means that citizens cannot directly sue the government for failing to uphold or enforce them.  They are primarily meant to serve as moral guidelines and inspire responsible citizenship.  While the government is expected to promote and encourage the fulfillment of these duties, there is no direct legal mechanism for their enforcement through courts.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the justiciability of Fundamental Duties.  The non-justiciable nature of these duties reflects a balance between individual rights and civic responsibilities.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the amendment of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  Any provision of the Constitution can be amended by a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  Amendments affecting the federal structure of the Constitution require ratification by at least half of the State Legislatures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution cannot be amended by a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.  Article 368 lays down a specific procedure for constitutional amendments, which requires a special majority in both Houses (a majority of the total membership of each House and a majority of two-thirds of the members present and voting).  Statement 2 is correct.  Certain amendments, particularly those affecting the federal structure of the Constitution (e.g., changes to the distribution of powers between the Union and States), require ratification by at least half of the State Legislatures.  This ensures that significant changes to the federal balance have the support of a substantial number of states. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the complex and nuanced process of constitutional amendment in India. The requirement of State Legislature ratification underscores the federal nature of the Indian political system.


**10. With reference to the President's rule in a state under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can impose President's rule only upon a report from the Governor of the concerned state.
2.  Imposition of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President can impose President's rule (Article 356) only on the basis of a report from the Governor of the concerned state indicating a failure of the constitutional machinery in that state.  While the Governor's report is crucial, the President is not bound to act solely on the Governor's recommendation.  The President can also seek independent advice before taking a decision.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The imposition of President's rule does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.  The President may choose to dissolve the assembly, but it is not mandatory.  The President can also keep the assembly in suspended animation and allow it to function after the situation normalizes. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the process and consequences of invoking Article 356.  The power under Article 356 has been a subject of much debate and judicial scrutiny, raising concerns about its potential for misuse.


**11. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate Money Bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can delay a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does not have the power to initiate Money Bills.  Only the Lok Sabha (House of the People) can introduce Money Bills.  This is a crucial aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting the Lok Sabha's role as the primary representative of the people in matters of finance.  Statement 2 is correct.  While the Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill, it can only delay it for a maximum of 14 days.  After 14 days, the Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses, even if the Rajya Sabha has not approved it.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the Rajya Sabha's limited powers concerning Money Bills. The special treatment given to Money Bills in the Constitution emphasizes the Lok Sabha's dominant position in financial matters.


**12. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, and republic.
2. The word "socialist" was added to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Indian Constitution's Preamble. Statement 1 is correct; the Preamble declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. These words define the fundamental nature of the Indian state and its commitment to certain core values.  Statement 2 is also correct; the word "socialist" was indeed added to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  This amendment reflected the government's commitment to socialist ideals and principles of social and economic justice.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially reflect the Preamble's content and historical development. Option (d) is completely false since both statements are factual and essential for understanding the Preamble's meaning and evolution. The addition of "socialist" marked a significant shift in the constitutional narrative, reflecting the ideological changes during that period.


**13. Consider the following statements about the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, allowing it to declare laws inconsistent with the Constitution as void.
2.  The Supreme Court's decisions are final and binding on all other courts in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key features of the Supreme Court of India. Statement 1 is correct; the Supreme Court possesses the power of judicial review, a cornerstone of its role in upholding the Constitution.  This power allows the Court to examine laws passed by the Parliament or State Legislatures and declare them void if they are found to be inconsistent with the Constitution's provisions.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Supreme Court's decisions are final and binding on all other courts within India.  This ensures consistency in legal interpretation and the uniform application of the law across the country.  There is no appeal against the Supreme Court's judgment. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially describe the Supreme Court's powers. Option (d) is entirely false because both statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's crucial role as the guardian of the Constitution and the highest court of appeal in India.


**14. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 mandated the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  Panchayati Raj Institutions are empowered to levy taxes and collect revenues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India. Statement 1 is correct; the 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 constituted PRIs as a three-tier system at the village, intermediate (block or taluka), and district levels.  This aimed to decentralize power and bring governance closer to the people at the grassroots level.  Statement 2 is also correct; PRIs are empowered to levy certain taxes and collect revenues, giving them some financial autonomy to manage their affairs and implement development programs.  This financial independence is vital for their effective functioning. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is false because both statements accurately reflect the establishment and powers of PRIs as enshrined in the 73rd Amendment Act.  The establishment of PRIs represents a significant step towards democratic decentralization in India.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.
2.  The Union Budget includes both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of the Union Budget in India. Statement 1 is correct; the Union Budget is presented to Parliament annually by the Union Finance Minister.  This presentation is a significant event in India's political and economic calendar, outlining the government's financial plans for the coming fiscal year.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Union Budget encompasses both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.  The Revenue Budget deals with government receipts and expenditures, while the Capital Budget focuses on capital receipts (e.g., borrowings) and capital expenditures (e.g., infrastructure development).  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, while option (d) is false because both statements accurately reflect the presentation and components of the Union Budget.  The Budget process is a key element of India's parliamentary democracy and financial management.


**16. With reference to the "basic structure" doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The "basic structure" doctrine was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the *Kesavananda Bharati* case.
2. The doctrine limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, preventing changes that affect the fundamental features of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate regarding the "basic structure" doctrine in Indian constitutional law. Statement 1 is correct; the doctrine was first formulated by the Supreme Court in the landmark *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* case (1973).  This case established the principle that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its "basic structure" or fundamental features.  Statement 2 is also correct; the doctrine serves as a significant limitation on Parliament's amending power.  It prevents amendments that fundamentally alter the Constitution's core principles, such as democracy, secularism, federalism, and the separation of powers.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (d) is entirely false because both statements accurately describe the origins and implications of the "basic structure" doctrine, a crucial concept in Indian constitutional jurisprudence.  The doctrine reflects the judiciary's role in safeguarding the Constitution's fundamental principles.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the  Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body established by the President of India every five years (or as per the President's discretion) to review the financial relations between the Union and the States.  Its primary role is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of tax revenues between the Centre and the States.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  While the government is expected to consider these recommendations seriously, they are not legally enforceable.  The government can accept, reject, or modify these recommendations, but it is expected to provide reasons for its actions.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the binding nature of the Finance Commission's recommendations.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission play a vital role in shaping the fiscal federalism of India.


**18. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they are directly enforceable in courts of law.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy aim to establish a socialistic pattern of society.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable; they are not directly enforceable in courts of law.  While they serve as guiding principles for the government, they do not confer legally enforceable rights on citizens.  Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs aim to establish a socialistic pattern of society in India, promoting social and economic equality, welfare, and justice.  They outline the government's responsibility to create a society where opportunities are equally available to all, irrespective of their social or economic background.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the justiciable nature of the DPSPs. The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs is a key feature distinguishing them from Fundamental Rights.


**19. Consider the following statements about the Union Territories:**

1. Union Territories are administered directly by the Union Government.
2.  Union Territories have their own Legislative Assemblies and Councils.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Union Territories are administered directly by the Union Government, unlike states which have their own elected governments. The Union Government appoints an administrator (Lieutenant Governor or Administrator) to oversee the administration of the Union Territory.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Not all Union Territories have their own Legislative Assemblies and Councils.  Some Union Territories are administered directly by the Union Government without any elected legislature, while others have only a Legislative Assembly (e.g., Delhi, Puducherry) but not a Legislative Council.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the administrative structures of Union Territories. The administrative setup of Union Territories is a crucial aspect of India's federal system.


**20. With reference to the All India Services, consider the following statements:**

1. The All India Services are created by a law passed by the Parliament.
2.  Members of the All India Services serve both the Union and State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe features of the All India Services (AIS). Statement 1 is correct; the AIS (Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and Indian Forest Service) are created by a law passed by the Parliament.  This reflects the Union Government's authority over these services.  Statement 2 is also correct; members of the AIS serve both the Union and State Governments.  While they are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission, they are deployed to both Union and State cadres, allowing for inter-state mobility and a unified administrative structure across the country. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is entirely false because both statements accurately represent the AIS's creation and deployment within India's administrative framework.  The AIS plays a vital role in maintaining administrative cohesion across India's diverse regions.



**1. With reference to the provisions related to the amendment of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  An amendment to the Constitution of India can be challenged in the Supreme Court if it violates the basic structure of the Constitution.
2.  The power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is absolute and unrestricted.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court, in the landmark *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* case (1973), established the doctrine of "basic structure". This doctrine holds that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental features or basic structure. Any amendment that attempts to do so can be challenged and struck down by the Supreme Court.  This ensures that the core principles of the Constitution, such as democracy, secularism, and federalism, remain intact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power of Parliament to amend the Constitution is not absolute. As explained above, the doctrine of basic structure limits this power.  The Supreme Court acts as a guardian of the Constitution's fundamental principles, preventing any amendment that would fundamentally alter its character.  The amendment process itself, outlined in Article 368, also involves specific procedures and majorities, further restricting the Parliament's power.  The court's role in judicial review is crucial in safeguarding the integrity of the Constitution.


**2. With reference to the functioning of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Constitution, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House).  The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) can only offer suggestions or recommendations on a Money Bill, but it cannot initiate or amend it.  This reflects the principle that the Lok Sabha, being directly elected by the people, has primary control over matters of finance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha's role in relation to a Money Bill is limited to making recommendations.  It cannot reject or amend the Bill. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject the Rajya Sabha's recommendations, but it is not obligated to do so. The Lok Sabha's authority on Money Bills is paramount, ensuring that the government's financial plans are effectively implemented.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) can be suspended during a National Emergency.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial for individual liberty, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc.  This is evident in the specific clauses within each article outlining permissible limitations. The balance between individual rights and societal interests is a key aspect of the Indian constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While many Fundamental Rights can be suspended during a National Emergency (declared under Article 352), the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) cannot be entirely suspended. The Supreme Court has interpreted Article 21 broadly, ensuring that even during emergencies, certain core aspects of this fundamental right must be protected.  The court’s role in judicial review ensures that the government's actions during emergencies do not violate fundamental rights beyond permissible limits.


**4. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes a unitary system of government with strong centralising tendencies.
2.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India is based on a clear separation of powers with no overlapping jurisdictions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India operates under a federal system, but it is a quasi-federal system with strong centralising features.  While states have significant autonomy in certain areas, the Centre retains considerable power through various provisions, including the power to legislate on matters in the Concurrent List and the residuary powers.  The balance of power between the Centre and States has been a subject of ongoing debate and judicial interpretation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not establish a strict separation of powers between the Centre and the States. There is a significant degree of overlap in the legislative powers, particularly in the Concurrent List where both the Centre and the States can make laws on the same subject.  In case of conflict, the Central law prevails. The system is designed to accommodate both federal and unitary elements, which makes it unique and complex.


**5. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body comprising several election commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Election Commission of India can have multiple Election Commissioners, it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  The Chief Election Commissioner is the single most important authority in conducting elections and the other commissioners assist him.  Currently,  there is only one Chief Election Commissioner. Therefore, it is not a multi-member body in the sense of having multiple independent decision-making authorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is the independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice-President of India.  It plays a crucial role in upholding the democratic process in the country.


**6.  With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is that Directive Principles are not justiciable. They are not directly enforceable in courts of law.  While they guide the state's policy and actions, they do not create legally enforceable rights for individuals.  This distinction reflects the Constitution's approach to balancing individual rights with broader societal goals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy are intended to guide the state towards building a welfare state.  They outline various socio-economic goals, such as providing social security, promoting education, and reducing economic inequality. While not legally enforceable, they represent the Constitution's commitment to social justice and economic development.  They act as a moral compass for the government, influencing policy and legislation.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of 6 years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG's reports are presented to the President, who then lays them before the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. This provision ensures the CAG's independence and security of tenure, allowing them to perform their duties without fear or favor.  The CAG's independence is crucial for maintaining the integrity of public finances.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who is then constitutionally mandated to lay them before both Houses of Parliament.  This ensures parliamentary oversight of government spending and accountability of the executive.  The CAG's reports are vital for parliamentary scrutiny and public awareness of government finances.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister.
2. The Union Budget always includes both the revenue and expenditure estimates for the coming financial year.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Minister presents the Union Budget to the Parliament, which details the government's revenue projections and proposed expenditure for the upcoming financial year. This is a key event in the Indian parliamentary calendar and marks the beginning of the budgetary process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Union Budget, by its very nature, comprises both revenue and expenditure estimates.  The revenue section outlines the sources of government income (taxes, duties, etc.), while the expenditure section details the government's planned spending across various sectors and programs.  A comprehensive budget provides a clear picture of the government's financial position and its plans for resource allocation.


**9. With reference to the Governor of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. This reflects the constitutional arrangement where the President, as the head of state, plays a role in the appointment of state executives. The appointment process ensures that the Governor remains largely independent of the State’s political dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Governor has certain discretionary powers, the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly is generally exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister, who heads the State's Council of Ministers.  This aligns with the parliamentary system of government where the executive is responsible to the legislature.  However, in exceptional circumstances, the Governor can exercise their discretion.


**10. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2. The Gram Sabha is the primary decision-making body at the village level in Panchayati Raj system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and mandated the establishment of a three-tier system in all states. This involved the creation of Gram Panchayats at the village level, Panchayat Samitis at the intermediate level, and Zila Parishads at the district level. This amendment aimed to decentralize power and promote democratic governance at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha, comprising all adult residents of a village, plays a crucial role in the functioning of PRIs.  Although the exact powers and functions may vary from state to state,  the Gram Sabha generally has a significant role in local planning, decision-making, and monitoring of development programs.  It is a key element in ensuring participatory governance at the village level.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the term "Office of Profit," providing a clear framework for determining whether a position constitutes an "Office of Profit."
2.  The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, has never been amended since its enactment, reflecting a consistent approach to the issue of "Office of Profit."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* explicitly define "Office of Profit."  The term's interpretation has been a subject of much debate and litigation, leading to various court judgments attempting to clarify its meaning. The lack of a precise definition has contributed to controversies surrounding the disqualification of legislators holding positions perceived as "Offices of Profit."

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, has been amended *multiple* times since its enactment. These amendments reflect the evolving understanding and interpretation of "Office of Profit" and the need to address ambiguities and controversies arising from its application.  The amendments often respond to court rulings and political pressures to clarify which positions should be exempted from disqualification.  The frequent amendments highlight the ongoing challenges in defining and applying this crucial constitutional concept.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Indian Election Commission:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, ensuring centralized and efficient decision-making.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice determines the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is *not* a single-member body. It consists of the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, forming a three-member body.  This collegial structure is intended to ensure checks and balances and to prevent any single individual from dominating decision-making. The multi-member structure enhances the impartiality and credibility of the Election Commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does *not* determine the election schedule. The Election Commission of India itself is constitutionally empowered to determine the schedule for elections, ensuring its independence from executive influence.  This independence is crucial in ensuring free and fair elections. The Election Commission's authority to set the election schedule is a cornerstone of its autonomy and its ability to function impartially.


**3. With reference to the President's Rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's Rule can be imposed only upon a formal request from the Chief Minister of the concerned state, ensuring that the decision is based on a considered assessment of the state's situation.
2.  The imposition of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's Rule, under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, can be imposed *without* a formal request from the Chief Minister. While the Governor's report is crucial, the President's decision is based on the Governor's report and a comprehensive assessment of the situation, potentially including other factors. The absence of a mandatory Chief Minister's request allows the President to act decisively in situations where the state government is unable or unwilling to address a crisis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The imposition of President's Rule does *not* automatically lead to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.  The President can choose to keep the assembly intact or dissolve it, depending on the circumstances.  The decision to dissolve the assembly is a separate one, made based on a careful assessment of the situation and the potential for restoration of normalcy. The flexibility in this regard allows for tailored responses to various crisis situations.


**4. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a rigid division of powers between the Centre and the States, with little scope for flexibility or adaptation to changing circumstances.
2.  The Rajya Sabha provides equal representation to all states, ensuring that smaller states have a proportionate voice in the federal legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian federal system is *not* characterized by a rigid division of powers.  It features a flexible distribution of powers, with provisions for both cooperative and competitive federalism. The Constitution allows for the Centre to legislate on subjects within the state list under specific circumstances, and it also facilitates the sharing of powers and resources through various mechanisms. This flexibility is crucial to accommodate the diverse needs of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does *not* provide equal representation to all states.  It provides unequal representation, with larger states having a greater number of representatives than smaller states.  This unequal representation reflects the population disparities across Indian states. While aiming for a balance between representation and population size, the system does not provide perfect equality in the Upper House's composition.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1. A private member's bill can only be introduced by a member of Parliament who is not a member of the ruling party.
2.  The Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers primarily through the power of impeachment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A private member's bill can be introduced by *any* member of Parliament, irrespective of their party affiliation.  While private member's bills rarely become law, the right to introduce them is an important aspect of parliamentary democracy, allowing individual legislators to raise issues and propose legislation. The ability to introduce private member's bills is a crucial mechanism for backbenchers to voice their concerns and contribute to the legislative process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers primarily through *vote of no confidence*, not impeachment. While impeachment is a process available for removing the President, it is not the primary mechanism for controlling the Council of Ministers. The vote of no confidence is a far more direct and commonly used tool for holding the executive accountable to the legislature. The vote of no confidence allows the legislature to express its lack of confidence in the government, potentially leading to its resignation.


**6. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has the power to review its own judgements, ensuring consistency and fairness in its decisions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to pronounce upon the *constitutionality* of laws, not to question their *wisdom*. Judicial review ensures that laws conform to the Constitution; it does not give the judiciary the power to substitute its judgment on policy matters for that of the legislature. While the courts may consider the rationale behind a law, their primary role is to assess its constitutionality, not its efficacy or appropriateness.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India *does* have the power of judicial review over its own judgments. This power allows the Court to correct errors, address inconsistencies, and adapt to changing circumstances. The power to review previous judgments is an essential element of the Supreme Court's role in ensuring the consistent application of the law and the protection of fundamental rights.


**7.  Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning that their violation can be directly challenged in courts.
2. The Directive Principles are primarily concerned with establishing a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are *not* justiciable.  They are not legally enforceable by the courts. While courts may consider Directive Principles when interpreting laws, they cannot directly enforce them. The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles reflects the framers' intent to create aspirational goals for the state, without making them legally binding.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are primarily concerned with establishing a *welfare state*. They outline the social and economic goals that the state should strive towards, such as providing social security, promoting education, and ensuring equitable distribution of resources. The Directive Principles are a fundamental part of the Constitution's commitment to social justice and economic equality.  They represent the vision of a state actively working to improve the lives of its citizens.


**8. With reference to the local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Local self-government is best explained as an exercise in federalism.
2.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments aimed to establish a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj and municipalities across the country.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Local self-government is best explained as an exercise in *democratic decentralization*, not federalism. While it involves a degree of autonomy at the local level, it is not a separate tier of government in the same way that states are under federalism.  Democratic decentralization empowers local communities to participate in decision-making processes that directly affect their lives.  It aims to improve governance and service delivery at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd (Panchayats) and 74th (Municipalities) Constitutional Amendments aimed to establish a *three-tier* system of Panchayati Raj and municipalities.  While the specific implementation varies across states, these amendments provided a constitutional framework for local self-government, mandating the establishment of these institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels (in the case of Panchayats) and at the municipal, intermediate, and metropolitan levels (in the case of Municipalities).  These amendments were landmark steps towards strengthening local governance in India.


**9. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The parliamentary form of government ensures the independence of the executive and the legislature.
2. The main advantage of the parliamentary form of government is that the executive remains responsible to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The parliamentary form of government *does not* ensure the independence of the executive and the legislature.  On the contrary, it is characterized by a close relationship between the two, with the executive being drawn from and accountable to the legislature.  This interdependence is a defining feature of the parliamentary system.  The executive's accountability to the legislature is a crucial aspect of democratic governance.


Statement 2 is correct. The main advantage of the parliamentary system is that the executive remains responsible to the legislature. This accountability is ensured through mechanisms like votes of no confidence, questions, debates, and other parliamentary procedures that allow the legislature to scrutinize the executive's actions and hold it accountable.  This accountability mechanism is a cornerstone of democratic governance, preventing the executive from becoming authoritarian.



**10. Consider the following statements about the Aadhaar card in India:**

1. The Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or modified by the issuing authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Aadhaar card is a widely used identity document, it does *not* serve as definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes, and domicile is established based on different criteria.  Aadhaar is primarily an identity document, not a citizenship or domicile certificate.  It is a unique identification number assigned to individuals, and while it can be used for various purposes including accessing government services, it does not in itself determine citizenship or residence status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An Aadhaar number *can* be deactivated or modified by the issuing authority under specific circumstances.  This provision is designed to address errors, update information, and deal with cases of fraud or misuse.  The possibility of modification and deactivation is a safeguard against inaccuracies and potential abuse of the system, ensuring that the Aadhaar database remains reliable and accurate.  Therefore, the statement that an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or modified is incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Ninth Schedule was initially included to protect certain land reforms and zamindari abolition acts from judicial review.
2.  The number of acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule has significantly increased since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ninth Schedule was introduced in the Indian Constitution by the First Amendment Act of 1951.  Its primary purpose was to protect certain laws, primarily concerning land reforms and the abolition of the zamindari system, from judicial review.  This was done to prevent challenges based on fundamental rights, particularly the right to property.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this original intent.  Statement 2 is also correct;  while initially containing only 13 acts and regulations, the Ninth Schedule has seen a substantial expansion over the years, reaching 282 by 2016. This expansion, however, has been a subject of criticism, as it has been used to shield laws from judicial scrutiny even when they are arguably inconsistent with fundamental rights.  Therefore, both statements are factually accurate, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the validity of both statements.


**2. With reference to Article 31C of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 31C, as originally enacted, aimed to protect laws implementing certain directive principles from being challenged on the grounds of violating fundamental rights.
2.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the Kesavananda Bharati case invalidated the entirety of Article 31C.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 31C, inserted by the 25th Amendment Act of 1971, sought to protect laws implementing the Directive Principles of State Policy (specifically Article 39(b) and (c)) from being struck down as violating fundamental rights (Articles 14 and 19).  This reflects the core aim of statement 1, making it correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) did not invalidate the entire Article 31C. Instead, it struck down the second provision of Article 31C, which prevented judicial review of laws claiming to implement the Directive Principles.  The first provision, which protected laws implementing specific directive principles from challenge on fundamental rights grounds, remained valid.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, leading to option (a) as the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the court's decision and the content of Article 31C.


**3. With reference to the criticism of Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Critics argue that the numerous limitations and restrictions on Fundamental Rights render them ineffective.
2.  The absence of socio-economic rights in the original list of Fundamental Rights has been a major point of contention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Critics of Fundamental Rights in India have consistently pointed out the extensive limitations and restrictions placed upon them, arguing that these exceptions significantly diminish their practical effect and render them less impactful.  This aligns with statement 1.  Furthermore, the absence of explicit socio-economic rights, such as the right to work, social security, and adequate living standards, in the original enumeration of Fundamental Rights has been a subject of ongoing debate and criticism.  This is accurately represented in statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect criticisms levelled against Fundamental Rights, making (c) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the full extent of the criticism.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs):**

1.  The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they are directly enforceable in courts.
2.  The DPSPs primarily aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not justiciable.  They are not directly enforceable by courts of law.  While they serve as guidelines for the state, they do not provide individuals with a legal remedy if the state fails to implement them.  Statement 2 is correct; the DPSPs are designed to guide the state towards creating a welfare state, focusing on social and economic justice and the well-being of citizens.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly characterize the justiciability of the DPSPs.


**5. With reference to the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 42nd Amendment Act introduced the term "secular" into the Preamble of the Constitution.
2.  The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act, enacted during the Emergency period, brought about significant changes to the Constitution. One of its key features was the insertion of the word "secular" into the Preamble, explicitly reflecting the secular nature of the Indian state.  This makes statement 1 correct.  Additionally, the same amendment introduced Part IV-A, which contains the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  Statement 2 is therefore also correct.  Consequently, both statements accurately describe the impact of the 42nd Amendment, making (c) the right choice. Options (a), (b), and (d) only partially represent the changes introduced by the amendment.


**6. With reference to the concept of secularism in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution adopts a model of secularism that involves complete separation of religion and state.
2.  The Indian Constitution provides for certain safeguards to protect the interests of religious minorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's concept of secularism differs from the Western model of strict separation between religion and state.  It is often described as "positive secularism" or "inclusive secularism," where the state does not endorse any particular religion but actively protects the rights of all religious communities. Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution of India explicitly guarantees several rights to protect religious minorities, including the right to establish and administer educational institutions and the right to conserve their distinct language, script, or culture.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nature of secularism as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973):**

1.  The Kesavananda Bharati case established the doctrine of "basic structure" of the Constitution.
2.  The Kesavananda Bharati case ruled that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is unlimited.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is a landmark judgment in Indian constitutional law.  The Supreme Court, in this case, propounded the doctrine of "basic structure," holding that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is not absolute and cannot alter its fundamental or essential features.  This makes statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The very essence of the Kesavananda Bharati judgment was to limit Parliament's amending power by establishing the concept of a "basic structure" that cannot be amended.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, resulting in (a) as the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) misinterpret the key findings of the case.


**8. With reference to the Minerva Mills case (1980), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Minerva Mills case upheld the validity of the 42nd Amendment's expansion of Article 31C.
2.  The Minerva Mills case emphasized the importance of maintaining a balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Minerva Mills case (1980) is another significant case in Indian constitutional law.  The Supreme Court in this case struck down certain provisions of the 42nd Amendment, including the expansion of Article 31C, which had broadened the scope of laws protected from judicial review on fundamental rights grounds.  This makes statement 1 incorrect.  However, the court did emphasize the need to maintain a balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, highlighting the importance of both for a functioning democracy.  Statement 2 is therefore correct.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly reflect the court's decision in the Minerva Mills case.


**9. With reference to the right to property in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to property was originally a Fundamental Right under the Indian Constitution.
2.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 completely abolished the right to property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The right to property was initially included as a Fundamental Right in the Indian Constitution (Article 31). However, it underwent significant changes over time due to various amendments and judicial interpretations.  Statement 1 is therefore correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 44th Amendment Act did not abolish the right to property entirely.  Instead, it removed it from the list of Fundamental Rights and made it a simple legal right under Article 300A.  This means that while it's still a protected right, it is not a fundamental right that is given the same high level of protection as other fundamental rights.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, leading to (a) as the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the legal history of the right to property in India.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Swaran Singh Committee:**

1. The Swaran Singh Committee recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution.
2. The Swaran Singh Committee was formed after the 42nd Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Swaran Singh Committee was appointed in 1976 to review and recommend changes to the Constitution. A key recommendation was the addition of Fundamental Duties to the Constitution, which were subsequently incorporated through the 42nd Amendment Act.  This makes statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect because the committee was established *before* the 42nd Amendment Act to study the need for changes to the constitution and the amendment was a result of the committee's recommendations.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, and the correct answer is (a). Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the timeline and role of the Swaran Singh Committee.


**11. With reference to the Emergency Provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution allows for three types of emergencies: national, state, and financial.
2.  During a national emergency, the federal structure of the Indian government is unaffected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution outlines provisions for three types of emergencies: national emergency (Article 352), state emergency or President's Rule (Article 356), and financial emergency (Article 360).  Statement 1 accurately reflects this.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The declaration of a national emergency significantly alters the balance of power between the Centre and the States, effectively shifting the federal structure towards a unitary one.  While not formally amending the Constitution, the Centre gains extensive powers to direct and control the States.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the impact of emergency provisions on the federal structure.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2.  The CAG's term is five years or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is appointed by the President of India, as per Article 148 of the Constitution.  This makes statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG holds office for six years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The term is not five years and the age limit is 65, not 62. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct; the correct answer is (a). Options (b), (c), and (d) provide incorrect information regarding the CAG's appointment and term.


**13. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission is responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.
2.  The Election Commission is a single-member body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is the constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President. This makes statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECI is not a single-member body; it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and can have up to two other Election Commissioners, as deemed necessary by the President.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, and (a) is the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the composition of the Election Commission.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Backward Classes:**

1.  The National Commission for Backward Classes was established through a constitutional amendment.
2.  The Commission's recommendations are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) was established through a constitutional amendment (the 102nd Amendment Act of 2018), which added a new Article 342A to the Constitution.  This makes statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The recommendations of the NCBC are not legally binding on the government; they are advisory in nature.  The government can accept or reject the Commission's recommendations, but it must provide reasons for rejecting them. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. The correct option is (a).  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the legal status and powers of the NCBC.


**15. With reference to the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2.  The Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities investigates matters relating to safeguards for linguistic minorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the President of India, not the Chief Election Commissioner.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Commissioner's primary function is to investigate matters related to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the Constitution and to report to the President.  This makes statement 2 correct.  Consequently, only statement 2 is accurate, and the correct answer is (b). Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccurate information about the appointment and functions of the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising of three members, including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The President of India appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutionally mandated body. While the exact number of members can vary based on the needs of the ECI,  it always includes the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and at least two Election Commissioners.  The current structure is a three-member body.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The appointment of the CEC and Election Commissioners is a crucial aspect of maintaining the ECI's independence. The President appoints them, but the process involves the Prime Minister's recommendation. This ensures a degree of political neutrality in the selection process, although debates regarding the extent of this independence continue. The process is also subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders and constitutional experts, highlighting the importance of a transparent and merit-based selection.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed only after the state government recommends its imposition.
2. The proclamation of President's rule must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within two months, failing which it lapses automatically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's rule, under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, can be imposed even without a recommendation from the state government. While the Governor's report is often a trigger, the President's decision is independent and based on a variety of factors, including reports from the Governor, intelligence inputs, and the overall political situation in the state.  This provision has been a subject of debate regarding its potential for misuse.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the proclamation of President's rule needs parliamentary approval within two months, its automatic lapse isn't guaranteed. The Parliament can extend the President's rule beyond this initial period.  The duration of President's rule is subject to parliamentary discretion, which creates a dynamic situation where the executive and legislature interact, sometimes leading to political friction and debate over the limits of governmental power.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly mentions the term "federal" but provides for a quasi-federal structure.
2. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly use the term "federal," instead describing itself as a Union of States. However, the structure displays both federal and unitary features, leading to ongoing debates about its precise nature. The distribution of powers between the Union and States, along with the presence of a Supreme Court to arbitrate disputes, reflects federal elements.  However, the strong central government and numerous provisions allowing for central intervention in state matters showcase unitary characteristics. This "cooperative federalism" is a dynamic aspect of Indian governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The appointment of Governors is a crucial aspect of Centre-State relations.  The President appoints Governors, but the process involves the advice of the Prime Minister. This arrangement reflects the centralizing tendencies within the Indian federal structure, as the central government plays a significant role in selecting individuals who will head state governments. The selection process and the Governors' roles are often subject to political maneuvering and debate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament of India:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Constitution, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). This reflects the principle that the House of the People, directly elected by the people, holds primary control over financial matters. The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) can make recommendations, but it cannot initiate or amend a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill.  It can only delay the passage of a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days.  This limited power of the Rajya Sabha reflects the constitutional design that prioritizes the Lok Sabha's role in financial legislation.  The differences in powers between the two Houses are a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system, often leading to political debates.


**5. With reference to the local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.
2. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act provides for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act, passed in 1992, aimed at strengthening local self-government by providing constitutional status to Panchayati Raj institutions.  It mandates a three-tier system (Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the intermediate level, and Zila Parishad at the district level), although there might be variations based on the state's specific context.  This amendment is a significant step towards decentralization and empowering rural communities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 74th Amendment Act, also passed in 1992, aimed at reforming urban local governments.  It provides for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in municipalities, promoting inclusivity and representation.  The implementation of this reservation has been a subject of debate regarding its effectiveness and challenges.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG submits its audit reports directly to the President, who then lays them before Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG's appointment and tenure are designed to ensure independence. The President appoints the CAG, but the process ensures a degree of political neutrality. The six-year term or age limit of 65 years, whichever is earlier, provides security of tenure, protecting the CAG from undue political pressure.  This independence is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the financial audit process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG's audit reports are submitted directly to the President, reflecting the constitutional framework of checks and balances. The President then lays these reports before Parliament, ensuring that the findings are brought to the attention of the legislature.  This process underscores the CAG's role in holding the government accountable.



**7. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning that they are enforceable in courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a social and economic democracy in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable.  They are not directly enforceable in courts.  However, they serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies aimed at social and economic justice. The non-justiciable nature is a key distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are intended to guide the state in creating a society based on social and economic justice. They encompass various aspects such as providing education, healthcare, and social security, aiming for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.  They are a significant part of the Indian Constitution's vision for a welfare state.


**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble declares India to be a "Socialist Secular Democratic Republic."
2. The word "Secular" was originally part of the Preamble but was added later through a constitutional amendment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution clearly states that India is a "Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic." These words reflect the founding fathers' vision for the nation, emphasizing its independence, commitment to socialism, secularism, democracy, and republican values.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the words "Socialist" and "Secular" were added to the Preamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, the essence of secularism was already implicit in the original Constitution.  The addition of the word "Secular" explicitly reinforced this commitment.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination for recruitment to All India Services.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is the body responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination, a highly competitive exam for recruiting candidates to various services under the Union and state governments, including the All India Services (IAS, IPS, IFS).  The UPSC plays a vital role in maintaining the meritocratic nature of recruitment to these important services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  This process is designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the UPSC.  The President's role in the appointment highlights the constitutional framework for maintaining the neutrality of institutions involved in crucial governmental functions.


**10. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor's tenure is subject to the pleasure of the President, meaning that the President can remove the Governor at any time without giving any reason. This highlights the central government's influence over state governments.  However, the convention is that Governors complete their terms unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, it's not at his or her absolute discretion. Typically, the Governor dissolves the Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.  There are instances where the Governor might act independently, but such actions are subject to significant legal and political scrutiny.  The Governor's power to dissolve the Assembly is a complex and potentially contentious aspect of the Indian political system.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body constituted by the President of India under Article 324 of the Constitution.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures, as well as the elections of the President and Vice-President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Constitution of India. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.  The ECI is independent of the government and plays a crucial role in upholding the democratic process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The ECI's primary function is to conduct free and fair elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.  It oversees the entire electoral process, from voter registration to the announcement of results, ensuring transparency and impartiality.  The ECI's role is vital in maintaining the integrity of the Indian electoral system, a cornerstone of Indian democracy.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the ECI's constitutional mandate and operational responsibilities.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding President's Rule in India:**

1. The President's Rule, also known as Article 356, can be imposed only if the State government fails to comply with the directions given by the Union Government.
2.  Imposition of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the failure of a State government to comply with the directions of the Union Government can be a ground for imposing President's Rule under Article 356, it is not the only ground.  Article 356 allows the President to impose President's Rule if the state government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. This encompasses a broader range of situations, including breakdown of law and order, internal disturbances, or a situation where the government loses its majority support in the Assembly.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The imposition of President's Rule does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.  While the Assembly can be dissolved, it is at the discretion of the President.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, particularly if there's a chance of restoring constitutional governance without an election. The decision to dissolve the Assembly depends on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation by the Union government.


**3. With reference to Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, characterized by a strong central government with significant powers over the states.
2. The distribution of powers between the Union and the States is based on the principle of cooperative federalism, emphasizing collaboration and shared responsibilities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's federal structure is often described as quasi-federal because it leans towards a strong central government. While states have significant autonomy in certain areas, the Union government possesses considerable powers, including the power to intervene in state affairs under Article 356 (President's Rule), and control over crucial areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency. This makes the Indian federation different from a purely symmetrical federal system.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Although the Indian federal system has a strong centralizing tendency, the principle of cooperative federalism is also a significant aspect of its functioning. This involves collaboration between the Union and State governments in various areas like planning, development, and implementation of policies.  The National Development Council, for instance, is a platform for such collaboration.  The sharing of powers and responsibilities between the Union and States is dynamic and evolves over time based on contextual needs and political dynamics.


**4. With reference to Local Self-Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments aimed to decentralize power and enhance the role of local governments (Panchayats and Municipalities) in rural and urban areas respectively.
2.  Local self-government bodies in India are entirely independent of state governments and directly accountable to the citizens.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment (1992) and the 74th Amendment (1992) to the Constitution of India introduced Part IX and Part IX-A, respectively, to provide constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Municipalities.  These amendments aimed at empowering local governments, enabling them to play a more significant role in rural and urban development.  They mandated the establishment of three-tier panchayats and municipalities in states, guaranteeing them functional autonomy in specific areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Amendments aimed at enhancing the autonomy of local self-government bodies, they are not entirely independent of state governments. State governments play a crucial role in their supervision, providing financial resources, and enacting legislation related to their functioning.  Therefore, they are ultimately accountable to the state legislatures and, indirectly, to the citizens of the state.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to initiate Money Bills.
2.  A Money Bill can be introduced in the Lok Sabha only on the recommendation of the President.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does *not* have the power to initiate Money Bills.  According to Article 110 of the Constitution, only the Lok Sabha (House of the People) can introduce Money Bills.  This is a crucial aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting the principle of financial control vested in the lower house.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 117 of the Constitution states that a Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha after obtaining the President's recommendation.  This reflects the constitutional safeguard that ensures that the government's financial proposals are scrutinized and approved by the President before proceeding with their legislative process.


**6.  Consider the following statements about the Parliamentary Committees in India:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a parliamentary committee that examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
2. The Estimates Committee examines the estimates included in the annual budget and suggests improvements in the government's budgetary allocation and expenditure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a crucial parliamentary committee responsible for scrutinizing the CAG's audit reports on government expenditure. The PAC examines whether public money has been utilized efficiently and for the intended purposes. The committee's findings are vital in holding the government accountable for its financial management.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Estimates Committee is another key parliamentary committee that plays a significant role in budgetary control. It examines the budget estimates presented by the government, analyzing the proposed allocation of funds for various programs and schemes. It identifies areas where expenditure can be optimized and suggests improvements in budgetary planning and execution.  The committee's recommendations are valuable in ensuring that public resources are allocated effectively and efficiently.


**7. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, enabling it to declare laws inconsistent with the Constitution as void.
2. The High Courts in India only have appellate jurisdiction and cannot exercise original jurisdiction in any matter.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, a fundamental aspect of its role in upholding the Constitution. This power allows the Supreme Court to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by the Parliament or State Legislatures.  If a law is found to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can declare it void.  This power is crucial in maintaining the supremacy of the Constitution and safeguarding fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  High Courts in India possess both original and appellate jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction means the power to hear cases directly, without them being referred from lower courts.  High Courts have original jurisdiction in certain matters, such as writ petitions and other specified cases.  While they also have appellate jurisdiction (hearing appeals from lower courts), their role is not limited to appeals alone.


**8.  With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor is the head of the State executive and exercises his powers directly or through officers subordinate to him.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  Article 156 of the Constitution states that the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can remove the Governor at any time, although such a removal is rare and typically occurs only in exceptional circumstances.  This provision emphasizes the supremacy of the Union government in relation to the states.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor is the constitutional head of the State executive.  Article 154 of the Constitution vests the executive power of the State in the Governor, who exercises these powers either directly or through officers subordinate to him.  This means that the Governor is the nominal head of the state administration, and the day-to-day administration is carried out by the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Prime Minister of India:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and is the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Prime Minister is responsible for the overall functioning of the government and chairs the Cabinet meetings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister of India. However, this appointment is largely based on convention.  The President typically appoints the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  This reflects the principle of parliamentary democracy, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Prime Minister is the head of the government and has overall responsibility for its functioning. The Prime Minister chairs Cabinet meetings, coordinates policy-making, and oversees the implementation of government programs. The Prime Minister's office is central to the executive branch, acting as a crucial coordinating and decision-making body.


**10. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Information Act, 2005 guarantees every citizen the right to access information held by public authorities.
2.  The Act exempts certain information from disclosure on grounds of national security,  cabinet papers, and personal information.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act) is a landmark legislation in India that empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities.  The Act aims to promote transparency and accountability in government functioning.  Citizens can request information on a wide range of matters, promoting greater public participation in governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the RTI Act guarantees the right to access information, it also recognizes the need to protect certain information from disclosure.  The Act includes provisions for exempting information related to national security, cabinet papers, and personal information.  These exemptions are intended to safeguard sensitive information and prevent potential harm.  The balance between transparency and the protection of sensitive information is a key feature of the RTI Act.


**11. Consider the following statements related to the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Constitution of India is a written document, adopted on 26th January 1950, and it incorporates elements from various other constitutions around the world.
2.  The Constitution of India is based solely on the principles of liberalism and does not incorporate socialist or Gandhian principles.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is a written, codified document that was adopted on 26th January 1950, and it came into effect on the same day. The Constitution is a product of extensive deliberations and borrows elements from various sources, including the Government of India Act 1935, the US Constitution, the Irish Constitution, the Canadian Constitution, and the Australian Constitution.  It reflects a synthesis of various constitutional traditions and principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indian Constitution is rooted in liberal democratic principles, such as fundamental rights and the rule of law, it also incorporates elements of socialism and Gandhian philosophy.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, inspired by Gandhian ideals, aim to establish a welfare state and promote social and economic justice.  The inclusion of socialist principles reflects the post-independence aspirations for a more equitable society. The Constitution is therefore a blend of various ideologies and principles.


**12. With reference to the concept of "Office of Profit", consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India defines "Office of Profit" precisely, specifying which positions are considered to be offices of profit and which are not.
2.  A person holding an office of profit under the government is disqualified from being a member of Parliament or a State Legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution of India does *not* provide a precise definition of "Office of Profit."  Article 102(1)(a) and Article 191(1)(a) state that a person holding an office of profit under the government is disqualified from being a member of Parliament or a State Legislature. However, the exact meaning and scope of what constitutes an "office of profit" is not clearly defined in the Constitution.  This has led to various interpretations and controversies over the years, requiring the courts and Parliament to clarify the matter.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution clearly states that holding an office of profit under the government leads to disqualification from membership of either Parliament or State Legislatures.  This provision is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure the integrity of the legislative process.  The interpretation of what constitutes an "office of profit" is subject to judicial scrutiny and parliamentary debate to prevent abuse of power and maintain the independence of the legislature.


**13. Consider the following statements concerning the Indian Judiciary:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country and has the power to review the decisions of High Courts.
2.  All High Courts in India are established by the Parliament through Acts of Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country's judicial system.  It is the final court of appeal in all matters, including civil, criminal, and constitutional cases. This means that the decisions of High Courts can be challenged in the Supreme Court through appeals. The Supreme Court's role is to provide final and binding judgments on legal disputes, ensuring uniformity in the interpretation and application of laws across the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Parliament has the power to establish High Courts through an Act of Parliament,  the Constitution itself empowers the Parliament to establish High Courts for states and Union Territories.  However, the creation of High Courts is not solely dependent on parliamentary legislation.  The Constitution provides the basic framework, and the Parliament fills in the details through Acts.  The High Courts are established through a combination of constitutional provisions and parliamentary legislation.


**14. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually in the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.
2. The Union Budget includes both the revenue budget (receipts and expenditures) and the capital budget (capital receipts and expenditures).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is a crucial annual financial statement presented in the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister. This budget outlines the government's planned revenue and expenditure for the next financial year. The presentation and passage of the budget are key events in the Indian parliamentary calendar, reflecting the legislature's role in financial oversight.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Union Budget comprises two main components: the revenue budget and the capital budget. The revenue budget includes the government's estimated receipts (taxes, non-tax revenue) and expenditures (plan and non-plan expenditures). The capital budget deals with capital receipts (borrowings, disinvestments) and capital expenditures (investments in infrastructure, public sector enterprises).  Both aspects are integral to the Union Budget, providing a comprehensive picture of the government's financial planning and resource allocation.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a fixed term.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union government, State governments, and other public authorities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is appointed by the President of India. The CAG holds office for a six-year term or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure ensures the independence and impartiality of the CAG, enabling them to perform their audit functions without undue political influence.  The CAG's appointment process and tenure are designed to protect their autonomy and safeguard their ability to conduct independent audits.

Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG is the supreme audit institution of India.  The CAG audits the accounts related to all expenditure incurred by the Union and State governments, as well as various other public authorities.  The CAG's audit reports are crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.  The CAG's findings are presented to Parliament and State Legislatures, contributing to the legislative process of financial oversight.


**1. With reference to the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, consider the following statements:**

1.  It introduced the concept of Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution.
2.  It deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, is a significant amendment to the Indian Constitution, often referred to as the "mini-constitution" due to its extensive changes. While it did indeed remove the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights (making it a legal right instead), it did *not* introduce Fundamental Duties.  Fundamental Duties were added later, through the 42nd Amendment Act itself, not a subsequent amendment.  The statement confusingly implies that the introduction of Fundamental Duties was a separate event.  The 42nd Amendment made sweeping changes, including altering the Preamble to include "socialist," "secular," and "integrity,"  along with other substantial revisions to various articles.  Option (b) accurately reflects one of the key changes, while option (a) is factually incorrect regarding the timing of the Fundamental Duties inclusion. Options (c) and (d) are therefore incorrect because they incorrectly associate the two distinct events.


**2. With reference to the provisions related to the President's Rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  President's Rule can be imposed only if the State Legislative Assembly is dissolved.
2.  The President's Rule can be imposed only upon a written recommendation from the State Governor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The imposition of President's rule, also known as Article 356,  does not necessitate the prior dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly. While the Governor's report is crucial, it's not the sole determinant; the President's satisfaction is paramount. The Governor's report, while often the trigger, can be based on various factors, including a breakdown of law and order or a situation where the government cannot function effectively. The President has the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to impose President's Rule, making the Governor's recommendation a necessary but not sufficient condition.  The process involves a complex interplay between the Governor, the President, and Parliament, with the possibility of judicial review in case of any perceived misuse of the power.


**3. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1. These amendments added a third tier of government to the existing federal structure.
2. These amendments introduced the concept of "cooperative federalism" in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 introduced the concept of Panchayati Raj institutions (rural local governments) and urban local bodies, respectively, effectively creating a third tier of governance alongside the Union and State governments.  This profoundly impacted the decentralization of power and the participation of local communities in governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th amendments contributed to a more cooperative approach between different levels of government, they did not explicitly introduce the concept of "cooperative federalism."  Cooperative federalism is a broader political concept that evolved over time, representing a shift towards greater collaboration and shared responsibilities between the Union and State governments. The amendments laid the groundwork for aspects of cooperative federalism by empowering local bodies, but they didn't formally define or establish the concept.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Castes:**

1.  The Commission submits its annual report to the Prime Minister of India.
2. The Commission has powers similar to a civil court for investigating matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) submits its annual report to the President of India, not the Prime Minister. The President then places this report before Parliament.  This emphasizes the NCSC's constitutional status and its independence from the executive branch.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCSC possesses significant investigative powers, including the authority to summon witnesses, demand documents, and examine individuals under oath. These powers are comparable to those of a civil court, enabling it to thoroughly investigate complaints and allegations of discrimination or atrocities against Scheduled Castes. This is crucial for effectively upholding the rights and protecting the interests of this vulnerable community.



**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the Parliament of India.
2. The CAG holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President of India, not the Parliament. This underscores the CAG's independence from the legislative and executive branches.  The President's appointment reflects the high constitutional standing of this office.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG's term is designed to ensure impartiality and independence.  A fixed term protects the CAG from undue influence, while the age limit ensures that the office is held by individuals with sufficient experience and vigor.  The combination of a fixed term and an age limit safeguards the integrity of this crucial constitutional position.


**6. With reference to the Union List, consider the following statements:**

1.  Atomic energy is listed under the Union List.
2.  Inter-state rivers and river valleys are listed under the State List.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Atomic energy is a subject of national importance and security, hence it falls under the Union List.  This ensures centralized control and coordination in this sensitive area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inter-state rivers and river valleys are listed under the Union List, not the State List.  The management of inter-state water resources requires coordination among multiple states and the central government to prevent conflicts and ensure equitable distribution.  Listing this under the Union List facilitates such coordination.  The central government plays a crucial role in coordinating inter-state water disputes and resource allocation.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are justiciable in nature and can be enforced by courts.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state in India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable by courts.  They represent aspirations and goals for the state, guiding its policies and actions but not creating legally enforceable rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles aim to create a welfare state, promoting social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens.  They serve as a moral compass for the government, influencing policy decisions in areas like education, healthcare, and social security.  They are a unique feature of the Indian Constitution, reflecting a commitment to social and economic upliftment.


**8. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a five-member body.
2. The Election Commission resolves disputes relating to splits/mergers of recognized political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a five-member body; it is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and assisted by a number of Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can vary depending on the needs of the ECI, but it is not fixed at five.

Statement 2 is correct. The ECI has the authority to resolve disputes arising from splits or mergers of recognized political parties.  This power is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the political process and ensuring fair representation.  The ECI's decisions in such matters are binding, highlighting its role in maintaining a stable and fair political system.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the Prime Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. This appointment emphasizes the Governor's position within the federal structure of the Indian Constitution and ensures a degree of independence from State-level politics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, not the Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister's advice may influence the President's decision, the ultimate authority rests with the President.  The President's power to remove a Governor, albeit rarely exercised, highlights the importance of maintaining a balance of power within the federal system.


**10. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of India.
2. The NGT has the power to hear appeals against the orders of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament (the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010), not a constitutional body. It is a specialized tribunal designed to handle environmental disputes expeditiously and effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT has jurisdiction to adjudicate environmental issues and can hear appeals against the orders of the CPCB and other environmental authorities. This enables the NGT to play a crucial role in ensuring environmental protection and providing environmental justice.  Its establishment reflects a growing recognition of the importance of environmental protection within the legal framework.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The President of India gives authorization for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is first presented to the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) and then to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House).  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, which is the principal account of the Union Government.  This is a crucial step in the financial process, emphasizing the President's role as the head of state and guardian of the nation's finances.  The authorization process underscores the importance of checks and balances within the government's financial operations.


**12. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act fixed the minimum age for membership in a Panchayat at 21 years.
2. All Panchayats are required to have a three-tier structure (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, Zila Parishad).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act sets the minimum age for membership in a Panchayat at 21 years not 25 years. This provision aimed at encouraging the participation of younger individuals in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the three-tier structure (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, Zila Parishad) is common in many states, it is not mandatory for all Panchayats across India.  The structure can vary depending on the state's specific needs and circumstances.  Some states may have a two-tier or even a single-tier system.  The 73rd Amendment provided a framework, but allowed flexibility to adapt to diverse local contexts.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act:**

1. The RTI Act guarantees the right to information to all citizens of India, including non-citizens.
2. The RTI Act provides for penalties for public authorities who fail to provide information within the stipulated time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RTI Act grants the right to information to all citizens of India, irrespective of citizenship status.  This demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability in governance.  The inclusion of non-citizens reflects a broader commitment to openness.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RTI Act provides for penalties for public authorities that fail to provide information within the specified timeframe or unreasonably deny access.  This provision is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the Act and deter the withholding of information.  The penalty mechanism is a crucial element in making the Act truly effective.


**14. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to property is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution.
2.  The right to education is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to property was a fundamental right initially but was removed from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.  It is now a legal right, enforceable in courts but not a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct. The right to education was added to the list of Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Amendment Act of 2002.  This amendment reflects the growing recognition of the importance of education as a fundamental human right.  The provision now mandates free and compulsory education to all children aged 6-14 years.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court can issue writs only to enforce fundamental rights.
2. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court can issue writs (habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, quo warranto) not only to enforce fundamental rights but also to protect other legal rights and ensure the proper functioning of the government.  The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is broader than just fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, which means it can examine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.  Judicial review is a cornerstone of the Indian legal system, ensuring that laws and government actions conform to the Constitution.  This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be curtailed under any circumstances.
2.  The right to refuse to give one's handwriting sample as evidence is a guaranteed Fundamental Right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute. The Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc.  The Parliament can also amend these rights through a Constitutional Amendment Act, as demonstrated by the removal of the right to property.  Furthermore, certain Fundamental Rights can be suspended during a National Emergency (except Articles 20 and 21).

Statement 2 is correct. The right to refuse to give one's handwriting sample as evidence to support a prosecution is indeed a recognized right, stemming from the broader protection against self-incrimination.  While not explicitly mentioned as a separate Fundamental Right in a specific article, it is implied within the ambit of the protection against self-incrimination (Article 20(3)). This right prevents the state from compelling an individual to provide evidence that could incriminate them.  The Supreme Court has interpreted this principle broadly to encompass various forms of self-incrimination, including the provision of handwriting samples.


**2. With reference to Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are directly enforceable in courts.
2.  The Directive Principles were originally included as part of the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable. This means that they are not legally enforceable by courts. While they are considered fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has a moral obligation to implement them, individuals cannot directly approach courts to demand their enforcement.  The courts do, however, consider the Directive Principles when interpreting laws, and they can influence judicial decisions even without being directly enforceable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy were *not* originally part of the Constitution. They were added later, reflecting the evolving understanding of social and economic justice.  Their inclusion demonstrates the Constitution's commitment to a welfare state, but their non-justiciable nature distinguishes them from Fundamental Rights.


**3. With reference to the Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Duties are enforceable through writs issued by the courts.
2.  Safeguarding public property and abstaining from violence are included among the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Fundamental Duties, like Directive Principles, are not justiciable and therefore are not enforceable through writs. They serve as moral guidelines for citizens, promoting a sense of responsibility towards the nation and fellow citizens.  While there are legal provisions related to some aspects of the Fundamental Duties (e.g., laws against violence), there's no direct mechanism for their enforcement through court orders.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Fundamental Duties include a provision to safeguard public property and to abjure violence.  These duties reflect the Constitution's aim to foster responsible citizenship and social harmony.  The specific wording might vary slightly, but the core concepts of protecting public assets and avoiding violence are integral components of the Fundamental Duties.


**4. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to work, education, and public assistance in certain cases is provided for under the Directive Principles.
2.  The separation of the judiciary from the executive is explicitly mentioned as a Directive Principle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy include provisions for securing a social order promoting welfare, including the right to work, to education, and to public assistance in certain cases.  These provisions reflect the Constitution's commitment to a welfare state and social justice. While not legally enforceable, they are meant to guide government policy towards improving the lives of citizens.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Indian Constitution aims for an independent judiciary and separation of powers,  the separation of the judiciary from the executive is not explicitly stated as a Directive Principle.  The independence of the judiciary is ensured through various constitutional provisions, but it is not directly listed within the Directive Principles.  The Directive Principles focus more on social and economic goals.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the amendment of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, without any limitation.
2.  The procedure for amending the Constitution involves a special majority in Parliament and, in certain cases, ratification by state legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is not unlimited. The Supreme Court has established the doctrine of "basic structure," which holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or amended.  This doctrine protects the core principles of the Constitution, even from amendments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution outlines different procedures for amendments, depending on the specific provisions being altered. Most amendments require a special majority in both Houses of Parliament (a majority of the total membership and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting).  Some amendments also require ratification by a specified number of state legislatures. This reflects the federal nature of the Indian Constitution.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution provides for a single citizenship, implying that an individual cannot be a citizen of both a state and the Union.
2.  The Constitution explicitly prohibits the reservation of seats in legislatures based on religion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution establishes a single citizenship.  Unlike some federal systems where individuals hold dual citizenship (both at the national and state level), Indian citizens are citizens of India as a whole, regardless of their state of residence. This promotes national unity and integration.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution abolished the old system of communal representation, which involved reserving seats in legislatures based on religious affiliation. This is a key element of the Constitution's commitment to secularism and preventing discrimination based on religion.  While reservations exist for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, these are based on social justice considerations, not religious identity.


**7. With reference to independent bodies in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, state legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.
2.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is responsible for auditing the accounts of only the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to various offices, including the Parliament, state legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.  Its independence is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's responsibilities extend to auditing the accounts of both the Central and state governments.  The CAG acts as the guardian of the public purse, ensuring that government funds are utilized efficiently and legally at all levels of government.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution:**

1.  A financial emergency can be declared by the President if there is a threat to the financial stability or credit of India.
2.  During a state emergency (President's Rule), the state government retains full autonomy in its administrative and legislative functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution allows the President to declare a financial emergency under Article 360 if the financial stability or credit of India is threatened. This provision empowers the Central Government to take necessary measures to address the financial crisis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  During a state emergency (President's Rule), the state government's autonomy is significantly curtailed. The Central Government assumes control over the state's administration and can issue directives to the state government.  While the exact extent of control might vary depending on the circumstances, the state government does not retain full autonomy during a President's Rule.


**9. With reference to the three-tier government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The three-tier system comprises the Union Government, state governments, and local governments.
2.  The three-tier system was established through a single constitutional amendment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's governance structure is based on a three-tier system: the Union Government (Central Government), state governments, and local governments (Panchayats and Municipalities).  This system reflects the federal nature of the Indian Constitution, distributing power among different levels of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of the three-tier system was not achieved through a single constitutional amendment. While the original Constitution established the Union and state governments, the local government tier was added later through the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992.  These amendments provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions and Municipalities.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Backward Classes:**

1.  The Commission submits its annual report to the Prime Minister.
2.  The Commission has the powers of a civil court while investigating matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) submits its annual report to the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  The President then places the report before Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCBC is vested with extensive powers, including those of a civil court during its investigations.  This empowers the commission to effectively gather evidence, summon witnesses, and ensure a fair and thorough inquiry into matters related to backward classes.  These powers are crucial for the commission's mandate to protect and promote the interests of backward classes.


**11. With reference to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Officer is appointed by the Prime Minister.
2. The Special Officer investigates matters related to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister. The President's role in this appointment reflects the constitutional importance given to protecting the rights of linguistic minorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary function of the Special Officer (now designated as the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities) is to investigate matters related to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities in the Constitution.  This includes investigating complaints of discrimination or denial of rights and making recommendations to address such issues.  The role is crucial for ensuring the effective implementation of constitutional provisions aimed at protecting linguistic minorities.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the Parliament.
2. The CAG holds office for a fixed term, irrespective of age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President of India, not the Parliament. This reflects the CAG's independence from the executive branch of the government. The President's appointment ensures that the CAG's selection is free from political influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. This ensures that the CAG maintains independence and is not beholden to any political party or government.  The age limit prevents the CAG from serving indefinitely, potentially leading to a decline in effectiveness.


**13.  With reference to the Basic Structure Doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The doctrine of Basic Structure was first propounded by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
2. The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution includes laws that are immune from judicial review under the Basic Structure Doctrine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The landmark Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is where the Supreme Court of India first articulated the doctrine of the "basic structure" of the Constitution. This doctrine limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, preventing changes that would destroy its essential features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ninth Schedule was initially intended to protect certain laws from judicial review, the Supreme Court has since clarified that even laws included in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has held that the basic structure doctrine overrides the Ninth Schedule's protection.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:**

1.  Fundamental Rights always prevail over Directive Principles in case of conflict.
2.  The Parliament can amend Fundamental Rights to implement Directive Principles, provided the basic structure of the Constitution is not affected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the situation is more nuanced than a simple "always prevails" statement.  While the Supreme Court has historically emphasized the primacy of Fundamental Rights, the Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, to achieve the goals of Directive Principles.  However, such amendments must not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament possesses the power to amend Fundamental Rights to facilitate the implementation of Directive Principles, provided that the amendments do not undermine the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has upheld this power, provided the core essence of the Constitution is preserved.  This reflects a balance between individual rights and societal goals.


**15. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is prepared and presented to the Parliament by the Department of Revenue.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in tax collection and revenue management, the Union Budget is primarily prepared and presented to Parliament by the Department of Expenditure.  The Department of Economic Affairs also plays a crucial role in the overall economic policy framework within which the budget is formulated.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary control over government spending and prevents the executive from spending public money without legislative approval.  This is a critical aspect of financial accountability in a democracy.


**1. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The principles are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.
2.  They aim to establish a socio-economic democracy, guiding the state's actions towards social and economic justice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution.  Statement 1 is correct because DPSPs are non-justiciable; they are not legally enforceable by courts.  While they are fundamental in the governance of the country, they don't provide individuals with the right to sue the government for non-compliance.  The government is morally obligated to implement them, but the enforcement mechanism lies primarily in political accountability and public pressure. Statement 2 is also correct. The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state by outlining socioeconomic goals such as social justice, economic equality, and the welfare of workers. They aim to create a society that is not only politically democratic but also socially and economically just.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the nature and purpose of the DPSPs.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject or amend a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, is the Upper House of the Indian Parliament.  Its powers are limited in financial matters compared to the Lok Sabha (House of the People). Statement 1 is correct because the Rajya Sabha's role regarding Money Bills is restricted.  While it can discuss and make suggestions, it cannot reject or amend a Money Bill. The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Lok Sabha alone holds the power to vote on the Demands for Grants, which form the basis of the annual budget.  The Rajya Sabha can only discuss and make recommendations but cannot vote on them. Therefore, both statements accurately describe the Rajya Sabha's limited financial powers.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. The Act clearly defined the jurisdiction of the central and provincial governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced significant changes to the Indian political system. While the Act did not explicitly define a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature in the manner we understand it today, it did make strides in establishing a more defined governmental structure.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.  The legislative and executive functions were still intertwined, and the judiciary lacked the complete independence it would later gain.  Statement 2 is correct.  The Act did introduce a degree of decentralization by demarcating powers and responsibilities between the central and provincial governments.  It established a system of diarchy in the provinces, dividing administrative responsibilities between elected ministers and appointed officials.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of the 1919 Act.


**4. With reference to the powers of the Parliament in India, consider the following statements:**

1. When a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it must be passed by a simple majority of members present and voting.
2. The Parliament of India can make laws on any item in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament's legislative powers are defined by the Constitution. Statement 1 is incorrect.  In a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), a bill must be passed by an absolute majority of the total number of members of both Houses present and voting, not a simple majority. This is a crucial aspect of the legislative process in cases of deadlock between the two Houses. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List in the national interest if a resolution to that effect is passed by the *Lok Sabha* (Lower House), not the Rajya Sabha (Upper House), with a two-thirds majority. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to recommending such legislation. Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the parliamentary procedures related to joint sittings and legislation on State List matters.


**5. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1.  NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.
2. The Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog is appointed by the President of India and enjoys the status of a Cabinet-rank minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank of the Government of India. Statement 1 is correct: NITI Aayog was established in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission. The shift aimed to move from a centrally planned economy to a more cooperative federal model, fostering greater state participation in development planning. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog is appointed by the Prime Minister (not the President), they do hold the rank and status equivalent to a Cabinet Minister.  The Vice-Chairperson is a key member of the Aayog, assisting the Prime Minister (who is the Chairperson) in its overall functioning.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to the provisions in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas in different states.
2. The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in four northeastern states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution address the governance of tribal areas. Statement 1 is correct: The Fifth Schedule outlines provisions for the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in various states, especially those with significant tribal populations.  It provides for the appointment of a Governor's representative to oversee the administration of these areas and to ensure the welfare of tribal communities. Statement 2 is also correct: The Sixth Schedule, specific to the four northeastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, details the administration of tribal areas within those states. It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils, granting them considerable autonomy in local governance and ensuring the protection of tribal customary laws and traditions.  Both statements accurately describe the distinct but related roles of the Fifth and Sixth Schedules in protecting the interests of tribal communities.


**7. With reference to the Union Government's financial procedures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial aspect of India's financial system. Statement 1 is correct: The Department of Revenue, under the Ministry of Finance, plays the central role in preparing and presenting the Union Budget to Parliament.  It compiles data, formulates fiscal policies, and presents the budget proposals to the Parliament for approval. Statement 2 is also correct: The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary repository of government revenues.  The Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from this fund without the explicit authorization of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary control over public expenditure and prevents unauthorized withdrawals.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Union Government's budgetary process and financial controls.



**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG's salary and conditions of service cannot be diminished during their term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments. Statement 1 is correct: The CAG is appointed by the President of India, and their term of office is six years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever comes first.  This security of tenure is designed to ensure their independence and impartiality in performing their audit functions. Statement 2 is also correct: The Constitution safeguards the CAG's independence by ensuring that their salary and service conditions cannot be reduced during their term of office. This protection against arbitrary changes prevents political interference and allows the CAG to perform their duties without fear or favour.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions designed to ensure the CAG's independence and effectiveness.


**9. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can return a bill passed by Parliament for reconsideration, but Parliament is not bound to accept the President's advice.
2. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President of India is the head of state and holds several significant powers. Statement 1 is correct. The President has the power to return a bill passed by Parliament for reconsideration. However, this is a discretionary power, and Parliament is not obligated to accept the President's advice.  If Parliament passes the bill again, the President is bound to assent to it. This reflects the principle of parliamentary supremacy in lawmaking. Statement 2 is also correct. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, but this is done in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. This ensures that the judiciary's independence is maintained and that appointments are made based on merit and experience.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent the President's powers and the constitutional checks and balances in place.


**10. With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties are enforceable by courts.
2.  The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution of India added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are a set of moral obligations for Indian citizens. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable by courts. They are primarily meant to instill a sense of civic responsibility and national pride among citizens, promoting social harmony and progress.  While there are no specific legal consequences for not fulfilling these duties, they are considered important for the well-being of society. Statement 2 is correct. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, a significant amendment to the Constitution, introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution.  This amendment aimed to balance the emphasis on Fundamental Rights by outlining the responsibilities of citizens toward the nation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for both general elections and by-elections.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner. While there are Election Commissioners who assist the Chief Election Commissioner, the ultimate authority rests with the Chief Election Commissioner.  Earlier, it was a multi-member body. Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for determining the election schedule, encompassing both general elections and by-elections.  This includes announcing the dates for nominations, polling, and the declaration of results. This power is crucial for ensuring the timely and efficient conduct of elections.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Gram Sabha:**

1.  The Gram Sabha has the power to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas.
2. The Gram Sabha has ownership of minor forest produce in Scheduled Areas.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Sabha is a crucial institution for local governance in Scheduled Areas (tribal areas). Statement 1 is correct: The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, grants Gram Sabhas significant powers, including the ability to prevent the alienation of land in Scheduled Areas. This helps protect tribal communities from land grabbing and ensures that their traditional rights to land are preserved. Statement 2 is also correct: The same Act also recognizes the Gram Sabha's right over minor forest produce in Scheduled Areas. This means that the Gram Sabha has the authority to manage and regulate the collection and use of minor forest produce, ensuring that tribal communities benefit from the resources in their areas.  Both statements accurately reflect the empowerment of Gram Sabhas under the 1996 Act.


**13. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission presents its annual report to the President of India.
2. The Commission has the powers of a civil court while investigating matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body that protects the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes. Statement 1 is correct: The NCSC submits an annual report to the President of India, detailing its activities, findings, and recommendations.  The President then places this report before Parliament, ensuring transparency and accountability.  Statement 2 is also correct:  The NCSC possesses extensive investigative powers, including the powers of a civil court. This enables the Commission to effectively investigate complaints of atrocities and discrimination against Scheduled Castes.  They can summon witnesses, examine documents, and compel the attendance of individuals, making them a powerful instrument for upholding the rights of Scheduled Castes. Therefore, both statements accurately describe the NCSC's functions and powers.



**14. With reference to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Officer is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Constitution specifies the qualifications, tenure, and removal procedure for the Special Officer.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is responsible for protecting the rights of linguistic minorities. Statement 1 is correct: The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the President of India, reflecting the constitutional mandate to protect linguistic minorities.  This appointment ensures that the officer acts independently and impartially. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* specify the qualifications, tenure, salary, allowances, service conditions, or removal procedure for the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. These details are usually determined by rules and regulations framed by the government. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional provision.


**15. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.
2. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution to protect certain land reform laws from judicial scrutiny.  Statement 1 is partially correct, historically. Initially, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely considered immune from judicial review. This was intended to prevent challenges to land reforms and other crucial legislation aimed at social and economic justice.  However, this immunity was not absolute and was gradually challenged in courts. Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's 2007 ruling significantly altered the understanding of the Ninth Schedule's protection against judicial review.  The court held that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973 (the date of the Kesavananda Bharati case), are subject to judicial scrutiny if they violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution.  This ruling limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection, making it less effective in shielding laws from constitutional challenges.  Therefore, both statements, while reflecting different phases, are historically correct.


**1. With reference to the Cultural and Educational Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Linguistic and religious minorities have the unrestricted right to establish and administer educational institutions solely for their own community members.
2. The state is obligated to ensure that children from minority groups are exposed to their own beliefs and cultural practices within government schools.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 30 of the Indian Constitution grants minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice, this right is not absolute.  It doesn't extend to the complete exclusion of members from other communities.  The state retains the power to regulate these institutions to ensure they meet certain standards of education, safety, and non-discrimination, even if they are minority-run.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly clarified that this right is to ensure equality with the majority, not to create a superior position for minorities.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the Constitution aims for a secular and inclusive society, it doesn't mandate that government schools actively promote the religious or cultural practices of specific minority groups. The focus is on ensuring equal opportunity and non-discrimination, not on actively promoting specific religious or cultural practices within state-run institutions.  Government schools must adhere to the principles of secularism and not promote any particular religion.


**2. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years is a fundamental right, enforceable through Article 32.
2. The prohibition of trafficking in human beings and forced labour is a Directive Principle of State Policy, not a justiciable Fundamental Right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, makes free and compulsory education a right for children aged 6-14, it is not directly enshrined as a Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution.  It is derived from the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, and its enforcement is not directly through Article 32.  The RTE Act is a statutory right.


Statement 2 is correct.  The prohibition of trafficking in human beings and forced labour is indeed a Fundamental Right under Article 23,  making it enforceable through the courts under Article 32.  It's a directly justiciable right, unlike many Directive Principles which are not directly enforceable.


**3. With reference to the Right to Equality in the Indian Constitution (Articles 14-18), consider the following statements:**

1. The abolition of untouchability is explicitly mentioned as a part of the Right to Equality, ensuring legal protection against caste-based discrimination.
2. Educational and cultural rights for minorities are not directly included within the ambit of Articles 14-18, which primarily focus on political and civil rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 17 of the Constitution explicitly abolishes untouchability and its practice. This is considered a crucial aspect of the Right to Equality, ensuring that individuals are not discriminated against based on their caste. The enforcement of this article is a key aspect of the fight against caste-based discrimination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Articles 14-18 primarily deal with political and civil equality, the protection of minorities' educational and cultural rights is intertwined with the broader principle of equality. Articles 29 and 30 address these rights specifically, ensuring that minorities are not discriminated against in accessing education and preserving their cultural identity. Although not explicitly within Articles 14-18, they are essential components of the overall commitment to equality within the Constitution.  The spirit of equality underlying Articles 14-18 extends to the protection of minority rights under Articles 29 and 30.


**4. With reference to the provisions related to elections and representation in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution mandates a specific method for counting votes and electing representatives, leaving no room for alternative electoral systems.
2. The Constitution outlines the eligibility criteria for voting and contesting elections, and also designates the body responsible for supervising elections (the Election Commission of India).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't prescribe a single, rigid method for counting votes and electing representatives. While it establishes the framework for a democratic system, it allows for flexibility in electoral systems within the broader parameters of free and fair elections.  Different electoral systems (e.g., first-past-the-post, proportional representation) can be employed for different legislative bodies, as determined by law.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution lays down the fundamental principles governing elections, including voter eligibility (universal adult suffrage), eligibility criteria for candidates, and the establishment of an independent Election Commission to conduct free and fair elections.  These provisions are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the democratic process.  The Election Commission's independence and role are central to the Constitution's commitment to fair elections.


**5. With reference to the Fundamental Duties enshrined in Article 51A of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Promoting international peace and security is a Fundamental Duty explicitly mentioned in Article 51A.
2.  Using UN peacekeeping forces for the resolution of international disputes is a Fundamental Duty as articulated in Article 51A.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 51A includes the promotion of international peace and security as a Fundamental Duty. This reflects India's commitment to global cooperation and peaceful relations.  The inclusion of this duty emphasizes the citizen's role in fostering peaceful international relations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 51A does not mention the use of UN peacekeeping forces or any specific mechanism for international dispute resolution. It focuses on the broader principle of promoting international peace and security.  While citizens might support or participate in UN peacekeeping efforts, this is not a direct requirement specified within the Fundamental Duties.  The article emphasizes the moral duty, not involvement in particular mechanisms.


**6. With reference to the Emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. A "Health Emergency" is explicitly recognized as a distinct form of emergency in the Constitution.
2.  The Constitution provides for a "National Emergency," a "State Emergency" (President's Rule), and a "Financial Emergency."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not specifically mention a "Health Emergency" as a separate category of emergency. While the government can take measures to address public health crises, these actions are not governed by the specific constitutional framework related to the three types of emergencies outlined in the Constitution.  Public health crises are dealt with under existing laws and powers, not under a specific constitutional emergency provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution explicitly provides for three types of emergencies: National Emergency (Article 352), State Emergency (President's Rule under Article 356), and Financial Emergency (Article 360).  These three provisions define the constitutional mechanisms for dealing with severe crises at the national or state level.  Understanding the differences and implications of these three types of emergencies is crucial for comprehending the constitutional framework of India.


**7. With reference to Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution (as amended), consider the following statements:**

1. The freedom to acquire and dispose of property is currently included among the freedoms guaranteed under Article 19(1).
2.  Freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to peaceably assemble without arms are both included in Article 19(1).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to acquire and dispose of property was originally a part of Article 19 but was removed by the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978.  It is now a constitutional right but not a fundamental right under Article 19.  This change reflects a shift in the constitutional approach towards property rights.

Statement 2 is correct. Freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms are both fundamental rights explicitly guaranteed under Article 19(1).  These freedoms are essential to a democratic society and are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, etc.  The balance between these freedoms and reasonable restrictions is a key area of constitutional jurisprudence.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, assisted by other Election Commissioners appointed by the President.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Election Commission of India is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, it can also include other Election Commissioners, the number of which is determined by the President from time to time.  The number is not fixed in the constitution. The key point here is that the commission is not a five-member body as stated in the distractor statement.  The Chief Election Commissioner holds primary responsibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent body, is responsible for deciding the election schedule, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice or the Home Ministry.  The independence of the Election Commission is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.  This independence is a cornerstone of Indian democracy, and the statement attempts to incorrectly attribute this power to a governmental ministry.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill but can only suggest amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution explicitly grants the Lok Sabha exclusive power over Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill; it can only offer suggestions, which the Lok Sabha may choose to accept or reject. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling the nation's finances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill. Its role is limited to recommending amendments, which the Lok Sabha is free to accept or ignore.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.


**3. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can only pardon death sentences after consultation with the Supreme Court.
2. The President can promulgate ordinances even when the Parliament is in session.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President of India has the power to pardon, commute, reprieve, or remit any sentence passed by any court, including death sentences. This power is exercised independently, without mandatory consultation with the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court's views might be sought, it's not a requirement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's power to promulgate ordinances is restricted to situations when Parliament is not in session.  Ordinances are essentially temporary laws that can be used to address urgent matters; however, they must be approved by Parliament within a specified time frame or they lapse.  This prevents the executive from bypassing the legislative process.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor cannot be removed from office except by impeachment by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss a Governor at any time.  This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Indian federation, with the Centre holding ultimate authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the removal of a Governor is a complex process, it doesn't involve impeachment by Parliament. The President can remove a Governor at any time based on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.


**5. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister.
2. The Union Budget is always passed by the Parliament without any amendments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, outlining the government's financial plans for the upcoming year, is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister. This is a crucial part of the annual budgetary process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Union Budget is subject to debate and amendments by both Houses of Parliament. While the government generally strives to pass its budget as proposed,  amendments are often made during the process. This ensures parliamentary oversight over government spending.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in civil and criminal matters.
2. The Supreme Court's decisions are binding on all other courts in India but not on the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court in the country, the highest court of appeal in both civil and criminal cases. Its judgments are final and binding on all other courts.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Supreme Court's decisions are binding on all other courts and lower tribunals, they are not binding on the Parliament. The Parliament retains the power to amend laws, even if those laws have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's role is to interpret the laws, not to dictate legislative action.


**7. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts. They serve as guidelines for the government to formulate policies aimed at social and economic justice, but they are not legally binding.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, where the government actively works towards improving the social and economic well-being of its citizens.  This is a key objective of the Indian Constitution.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Fundamental Rights in India:**

1. They are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2. They are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute. They are subject to reasonable restrictions as defined by the Constitution itself.  The courts play a vital role in determining the limits of these restrictions.

Statement 2 is correct. Fundamental Rights, guaranteeing basic freedoms and rights to citizens, are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution of India.  These rights form the bedrock of Indian democracy and are crucial for individual liberty.


**9. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels in all states.
2.  Panchayats have the power to levy taxes and raise funds for their functioning.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 mandates the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system (village, intermediate, and district levels) across all states. This amendment aimed to decentralize power and empower local governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Panchayats are constitutionally empowered to levy taxes and raise funds to carry out their responsibilities. This financial autonomy is crucial for their effective functioning.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG audits only the accounts of the Union Government and not those of State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President and has a fixed tenure, ensuring independence. The age limit ensures that the office is not held indefinitely.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments, ensuring transparency and accountability in public finances at all levels.


**11. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination for recruitment to various posts in the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and other Central Services.
2. The UPSC is an independent body and its members cannot be removed from office except by impeachment by Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC plays a vital role in recruiting candidates for various crucial positions in the central government, maintaining standards and meritocracy in the process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UPSC is an independent body, its members' removal is not subject to parliamentary impeachment.  The President can remove members on grounds of misbehavior or incapacity, following a prescribed procedure.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot prevent the passage of a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Only the Lok Sabha can initiate a Money Bill. The Rajya Sabha's power is limited to recommending amendments.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the Rajya Sabha can recommend amendments to a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha has the final say. The Rajya Sabha cannot prevent its passage; it can only delay it for a maximum of 14 days.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.


**13. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body.
2. The NCSC can only investigate complaints relating to atrocities against Scheduled Castes and not other forms of discrimination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body, established under Article 338 of the Constitution of India. It plays a vital role in safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCSC primarily focuses on atrocities against Scheduled Castes, its mandate extends beyond this to encompass various forms of discrimination and denial of rights. It can investigate a wide range of complaints related to the socio-economic and educational advancement of Scheduled Castes.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST):**

1. The NCST is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament.
2. The NCST's recommendations are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCST is a statutory body, established under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and later reconstituted under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.  It's important to note that it is not a constitutional body like the NCSC.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCST's recommendations are not legally binding on the government.  However, given the commission's importance in protecting the rights of Scheduled Tribes, the government generally gives serious consideration to its recommendations.


**15. With reference to the State Election Commissions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. State Election Commissions are responsible for conducting elections to local bodies (Panchayats and Municipalities).
2. State Election Commissioners are appointed by the Governor of the respective States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  State Election Commissions are independent bodies responsible for conducting free and fair elections to local bodies (Panchayats and Municipalities). This ensures the impartiality and integrity of the electoral process at the local level.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  State Election Commissioners are appointed by the Governor of the respective States, but the key point is that their independence from the state government is constitutionally protected to ensure the fairness of local elections.  The method of appointment doesn't negate this crucial element of independence.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The theory of basic structure, first articulated in the Kesavananda Bharati case, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2.  The theory of basic structure has been consistently upheld by the judiciary, leading to increased judicial power and acceptance by various political actors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The theory of basic structure, a cornerstone of Indian constitutional law, emerged from the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case.  This landmark judgment established that while Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368,  it cannot alter its "basic structure." This significantly limits the extent of amending power, preventing the dismantling of fundamental elements of the Constitution.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this core principle.

Statement 2 is also correct. The judiciary has consistently applied the basic structure doctrine in subsequent judgments, acting as a check on potentially excessive legislative amendments. This has undoubtedly enhanced the judiciary's role in constitutional interpretation and safeguarding fundamental rights. The acceptance of this principle by various political parties and governments, while not universal or unwavering,  demonstrates its enduring significance in the Indian political landscape.  The judiciary's role in safeguarding the basic structure is a crucial aspect of India's constitutional democracy, ensuring its stability and adherence to fundamental principles.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe aspects of the basic structure doctrine.


**2. With reference to constitutional amendments during 2000-2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The high number of amendments during this period indicates a lack of consensus among political parties regarding constitutional changes.
2.  The amendments passed between 2000 and 2003 were primarily of a non-controversial nature, implying broad political agreement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A large number of constitutional amendments in a short period like 2000-2003 could suggest several possibilities.  However, the question focuses on the *implied* consensus or lack thereof.  Statement 1 incorrectly assumes a lack of consensus based solely on the number of amendments.  A high volume of amendments doesn't inherently mean disagreement; it could reflect a proactive approach to legislative reform, addressing various issues simultaneously, or a response to urgent societal needs.  For example, a ruling party with a strong majority might push through a series of amendments efficiently, even if they are not overtly contentious.

Statement 2, while not explicitly stated in the source, is a more plausible interpretation. If the amendments were largely non-controversial, it would suggest a degree of political agreement.  The absence of significant public opposition or prolonged debate during this period would further support this interpretation.  The fact that the question focuses on the *conclusion* one could draw implies a need to infer the most likely explanation from the given information.  Therefore, given the limited context, statement 2 presents a more logical conclusion than statement 1.


**3. With reference to the special majority requirement for constitutional amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The special majority requirement for constitutional amendments aims to prevent hasty or ill-considered changes to the fundamental law.
2.  The special majority requirement ensures that only amendments supported by a broad cross-section of the population are enacted.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The requirement of a special majority for amending the Constitution is a fundamental safeguard against capricious or ill-considered changes to the nation's foundational legal framework.  A simple majority might not adequately reflect the gravity and long-term implications of altering the Constitution.  The special majority, typically requiring a majority of both houses of Parliament and the President's assent, ensures a higher level of deliberation, scrutiny, and consensus before any amendments are adopted.  This process is designed to ensure the stability and continuity of the Constitution, preventing impulsive changes that could destabilize the political order or infringe upon fundamental rights.  Thus, statement 1 accurately reflects this primary objective.

Statement 2, while desirable, is an oversimplification.  While a special majority aims to foster broader agreement, it does not guarantee that all segments of the population will support every amendment.  Political realities often involve compromises and trade-offs.  Furthermore, the process of amendment itself may not always fully reflect the nuances of public opinion.  Therefore, while a special majority strives for broader support, it does not guarantee universal consensus, making statement 2 an incorrect assertion.


**4. With reference to judicial review of constitutional amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The judiciary's power to review the validity of constitutional amendments is a key check on legislative overreach and protection of fundamental rights.
2.  If the amending power rests solely with elected representatives, judicial review of amendments becomes redundant and unnecessary.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Judicial review of constitutional amendments is a critical component of checks and balances in a constitutional democracy.  It ensures that the legislative branch, while possessing the power to amend the Constitution, does not exceed its authority by altering fundamental principles or infringing upon basic rights.  The judiciary acts as an independent arbiter, ensuring that amendments remain consistent with the underlying principles and spirit of the Constitution.  This prevents potential legislative overreach and safeguards the core values of the constitutional framework. Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects the importance of judicial review in this context.

Statement 2 presents a flawed argument. Even if amending power resides with elected representatives, judicial review serves a crucial function.  Elected representatives, while accountable to the people, may not always act in the best interests of constitutional principles.  Judicial review provides an independent mechanism to assess the legality and constitutionality of amendments, preventing potential abuses of power, even by those legitimately elected.  The existence of a powerful legislature does not render judicial oversight redundant; it simply necessitates a robust and impartial judicial system to uphold constitutional integrity.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the making of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Constituent Assembly's composition fully represented the diverse social and political viewpoints prevalent in India at the time.
2.  The claim that the Indian Constitution's making was unrepresentative is based on the argument that certain sections of society were underrepresented or excluded from the process.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constituent Assembly, while striving for inclusivity, did not perfectly mirror the diverse social and political landscape of India.  Certain sections of society, particularly marginalized groups, were underrepresented in terms of both direct participation and the influence they wielded in shaping the Constitution.  This underrepresentation is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate and analysis.  The argument that the Constitution's making was unrepresentative centers on this historical fact, acknowledging the limitations of the Assembly's composition and the unequal power dynamics of the era.  Thus, statement 2 accurately reflects the critique of the Constituent Assembly's representativeness.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Assembly included members from various provinces and communities, it did not fully represent all segments of society equitably.  The lack of proportionate representation of certain groups, along with the pre-existing social hierarchies and power imbalances, casts doubt on the claim of complete representativeness.  The Assembly's process, while significant, was not without limitations in accurately reflecting the full spectrum of Indian society at the time.


**6. With reference to gender justice and the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution's failure to adequately address gender justice is evident in the persistence of gender inequality in various aspects of Indian society.
2.  The Directive Principles of State Policy contain provisions that aim to promote gender equality, but these are not legally enforceable.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution, while promoting equality, has been criticized for not adequately addressing gender justice.  Despite constitutional guarantees of equality, gender inequality persists in various forms, including in areas like property rights, inheritance, access to education and employment, and representation in political and public life.  This ongoing disparity demonstrates a gap between constitutional ideals and societal realities, highlighting the need for continuous reform and implementation of more effective measures to address gender inequality.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this persistent issue.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy, while not legally enforceable in the same manner as Fundamental Rights, include provisions promoting gender equality and the welfare of women and children.  These principles serve as guiding objectives for the state, urging it to adopt policies that advance gender equality. The non-enforceability of these provisions, however, limits their effectiveness in ensuring immediate and tangible change, leading to ongoing debates on their role in achieving gender justice.  Therefore, both statements highlight the complexities of gender justice within the framework of the Indian Constitution.


**7. With reference to socio-economic rights and the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Placing socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles of State Policy rather than Fundamental Rights reflects a conscious decision to prioritize immediate political and civil liberties.
2. The relegation of socio-economic rights to the Directive Principles reflects a recognition of resource constraints and the need for gradual implementation of these rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The decision to include socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles of State Policy, rather than Fundamental Rights, is a complex issue with multiple interpretations.  Statement 1 reflects one perspective: that the framers prioritized the immediate establishment of political and civil liberties, considering these essential for creating a foundation upon which socio-economic rights could be progressively implemented.  This suggests a strategic prioritization, focusing on immediate needs while acknowledging the longer-term goals of socio-economic development.

Statement 2 provides another valid interpretation.  The inclusion of socio-economic rights in the Directive Principles could reflect a pragmatic recognition of the resource constraints faced by a newly independent nation.  The framers might have understood that immediately guaranteeing legally enforceable socio-economic rights might be unrealistic given the limited resources and infrastructural capacity.  Therefore, placing these rights in the Directive Principles allowed for a more gradual and realistic approach to their implementation.  Both statements, therefore, offer plausible explanations for the constitutional arrangement regarding socio-economic rights.  The nuanced nature of this decision makes both statements potentially correct.


**8. Consider the following statements about the preamble to the Indian Constitution:**

1. The preamble declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, and republic polity.
2. The preamble explicitly outlines a detailed plan for achieving social, economic, and political justice.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key aspect of the Indian Constitution's preamble.  It clearly establishes the nature of the Indian state, defining it as sovereign (independent and self-governing), socialist (committed to social welfare and reducing inequalities), secular (respecting all religions equally), democratic (governed by the people), and republican (with a head of state elected, not hereditary).  These adjectives are fundamental to understanding the core principles and values underpinning the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the preamble declares the objectives of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, it does not provide a detailed, step-by-step plan for achieving these goals.  These objectives serve as broad guiding principles for the state, setting the overall direction for policy and governance.  The specific mechanisms and strategies for achieving these aims are elaborated upon in other parts of the Constitution and through subsequent legislation and policy.


**9. With reference to the sources of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India Act of 1935 served as a major source, particularly for its administrative and federal structures.
2. The concept of Directive Principles of State Policy was primarily borrowed from the Australian Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935, despite being a product of colonial rule, provided a significant framework for the Indian Constitution's structure, particularly in its administrative and federal aspects.  Many provisions, including features of the federal scheme, the office of the governor, the judiciary, and Public Service Commissions, were adapted and modified from the 1935 Act.  While the Indian Constitution significantly altered and improved upon these borrowed elements, the 1935 Act served as a foundational building block.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of Directive Principles of State Policy was primarily borrowed from the Irish Constitution, not the Australian one. The Irish Constitution's articulation of these principles, which outline the state's social and economic goals, significantly influenced the corresponding provisions in the Indian Constitution.  While the Australian Constitution also contains some elements relevant to social and economic policy, the primary source for the Indian Directive Principles was the Irish model.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was initially added to protect land reform laws from judicial review.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2007 ruling rendered all laws added to the Ninth Schedule after a specific date immune from judicial scrutiny.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary purpose behind the creation of the Ninth Schedule. It was initially added to shield certain land reform laws from judicial review, thereby preventing challenges based on fundamental rights.  This aimed to accelerate the implementation of crucial land reforms crucial for social and economic transformation.  However, the use of the Ninth Schedule expanded beyond land reforms, leading to concerns about its impact on judicial review and the protection of fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2007 ruling stated that laws added to the Ninth Schedule *after* April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.  Laws added before this date retained their immunity, but the ruling significantly altered the scope and effectiveness of the Ninth Schedule as a shield against judicial scrutiny.  The ruling aimed to restore a balance between legislative action and judicial oversight of constitutional provisions.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India mandates the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.
2.  The President of India appoints the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Articles 330 and 332 of the Indian Constitution mandate the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, respectively.  This reservation is aimed at ensuring their representation in the legislative bodies.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The President of India appoints the Chairperson and members of both the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST).  These commissions are responsible for investigating and monitoring matters related to the welfare and protection of SCs and STs.  Their recommendations are crucial for the government's policies and programs concerning these communities.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Territories:**

1.  Union Territories are directly administered by the Central Government.
2.  Union Territories have representation in both Houses of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Union Territories (UTs) are directly administered by the Central Government, unlike states which have their own elected governments. The administration of UTs is overseen by the Ministry of Home Affairs or other designated ministries, depending on the specific UT.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some Union Territories have representatives in the Lok Sabha (based on population), they do not have representation in the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha represents the states, and Union Territories are not considered states in this context.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, with a two-thirds majority.
2.  A constitutional amendment requires ratification by a majority of state legislatures.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, but needs clarification.  While the Parliament has the power to amend most parts of the Constitution, the Supreme Court's "basic structure doctrine" limits the extent of this power.  Amendments cannot alter the fundamental features of the Constitution. The process involves a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Most constitutional amendments do not require ratification by state legislatures.  However, some specific amendments, as outlined in the Constitution itself, may necessitate state ratification.  This is not a general requirement for all amendments.


**4. With reference to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, but not those of the private sector.
2. The CAG's reports are submitted to the President, who then lays them before Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend beyond the Union and State Governments.  The CAG also audits the accounts of government companies, corporations, and other public bodies. While private sector entities are not under CAG's direct audit,  CAG's jurisdiction encompasses a vast range of public entities.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President of India, who is then constitutionally obligated to present these reports to both Houses of Parliament. These reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight of public finances and accountability of government spending.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable.  This means that they cannot be enforced by the courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate its policies and programs.  The courts cannot compel the state to implement them.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are fundamental to the concept of a welfare state, aiming to provide social and economic justice to all citizens.  They outline the goals the state should strive for in areas like education, healthcare, and social security.  While not legally enforceable, they exert significant moral and political influence on policy-making.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion to all citizens, irrespective of their faith.
2. The Constitution allows the State to intervene in religious affairs only in exceptional circumstances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Articles 25-28 of the Indian Constitution guarantee the freedom of conscience, the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate any religion, and the freedom to manage religious affairs.  This freedom is a fundamental right for all citizens.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. While the Constitution allows for some state intervention in religious matters (for example, to prevent religious practices that harm public order or morality), such intervention is limited and must be justified under specific constitutional provisions.  The state's role is primarily to ensure religious freedom for all, not to dictate religious practices.


**7. With reference to the powers and functions of the Gram Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gram Sabha is empowered to prepare plans for social and economic development of the village.
2. The Gram Sabha has the power to levy taxes and fees.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 243(A) of the Constitution empowers the Gram Sabha to prepare plans for social and economic development of the village.  The Gram Sabha’s role is participatory, involving villagers in the planning and implementation of development programs.  This is a crucial aspect of democratic decentralization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gram Sabha itself does not have the power to levy taxes and fees.  This power typically rests with the Gram Panchayat, the elected local government body. The Gram Sabha plays a crucial role in monitoring and influencing the Panchayat’s decisions, but it does not directly have the authority to impose taxes.



**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Finance Bill, which gives effect to the financial proposals in the Union Budget, can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first in the Lok Sabha, and then it is laid before the Rajya Sabha. While the Rajya Sabha can discuss and make recommendations, it cannot amend or reject the money bill.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Finance Bill, which is a money bill, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  This is because the Lok Sabha is the House of the People, and money bills primarily deal with financial matters. The Rajya Sabha has limited powers regarding money bills.  It can only delay but not reject them.


**9. With reference to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Disputes between the Centre and one or more States fall under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.
2.  Disputes relating to the election of the President of India are decided by the Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 131 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States. These disputes are typically related to constitutional interpretation, territorial boundaries, or sharing of resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Disputes regarding the election of the President of India are not within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.  Such disputes are decided by the Election Commission of India, and its decisions may be challenged in higher courts under appropriate legal provisions, but not directly in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.


**10.  Consider the following statements about the features of the Government of India Act, 1935:**

1. It introduced a bicameral legislature at the centre.
2. It established a federation with a strong centre.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935 introduced a bicameral legislature at the centre, comprising the Council of State (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House). This was a significant step towards a more structured and representative legislative system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act established a federal structure, but with a strong bias towards the Centre.  The federal government had significantly more powers compared to the provinces, reflecting a centralized approach to governance.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and provinces was tilted in favour of the Centre.


**11. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend Money Bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend Money Bills.  Money Bills, dealing primarily with financial matters, are initiated in the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha has limited powers over them. It can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, along with the Lok Sabha, has the power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of India. This highlights the role of both Houses in holding the executive accountable.  A resolution for impeachment must be passed by a two-thirds majority in both Houses.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the  Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They are based on the Gandhian philosophy of Gram Swaraj.
2. They aim to create a socialist pattern of society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Many Directive Principles, particularly those related to the organization of village panchayats and promotion of cottage industries, reflect the Gandhian philosophy of Gram Swaraj (self-governance at the village level).  These principles emphasize decentralized governance and rural development.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a just and equitable society.  The goal of a socialist pattern of society, which emphasizes social and economic equality, is a central theme running through many of the principles.   The state's role in achieving this goal is highlighted through policies relating to wealth distribution, social security, and economic opportunity.


**13. With reference to the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. It added the word "secular" to the Preamble.
2. It added the Directive Principle on equal pay for equal work.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added the words "socialist," "secular," and "integrity" to the Preamble, reflecting the evolving political and social ethos of the nation.  These additions broadened the constitutional vision and emphasized the nation's commitment to social justice, secularism, and national unity.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 42nd Amendment Act also added a new Directive Principle on equal pay for equal work for both men and women (Article 39(d)).  This reflected the growing emphasis on gender equality and fair labor practices.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is an independent body, not subject to government control.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for all elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated as an independent body, insulated from government interference.  This independence is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.  The ECI's decisions are not subject to review by any other authority.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Election Commission is responsible for determining the election schedule for all elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and State Legislatures.  It announces the dates for nominations, polling, and counting, ensuring a transparent and well-organized electoral process.


**15. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.
2. The Governor can reserve a Bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor does not have the unilateral power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.  The power to dissolve the Assembly rests with the Governor, but it is usually exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  In exceptional circumstances, the Governor might dissolve the Assembly under Article 356 (President's Rule), but this is not a routine power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor has the power to reserve a Bill passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration.  This power is typically exercised for Bills that raise issues of national importance or conflict with the Union's powers.  The President can then assent to, withhold assent, or return the Bill for reconsideration.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Indian Constitution:**

1. It is a written constitution, but it also incorporates some unwritten conventions.
2. It is a federal constitution, but it leans towards unitary features.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is primarily a written document, but it also incorporates some unwritten conventions and practices that have evolved over time. These conventions, though not explicitly stated in the Constitution, play a significant role in the functioning of the government.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Constitution is a federal system, but it exhibits several unitary features.  The Centre has significant powers over the States, especially in areas like national security, defense, and foreign affairs.  This blend of federal and unitary elements makes the Indian system a unique form of federalism, often described as "quasi-federal."


**17. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations on its own initiative.
2. The NHRC can issue enforceable orders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations suo moto (on its own initiative) or on complaints received.  This proactive approach allows the commission to address human rights concerns even without formal complaints. The NHRC's investigations play a significant role in bringing attention to human rights abuses and recommending remedial actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's recommendations are not legally binding or enforceable. While its reports and recommendations carry significant moral weight and influence government policy, it lacks the authority to issue orders that must be followed by the government or individuals.  Its role is primarily recommendatory.



**18. Consider the following statements about the Indian political system:**

1. The President is the head of the state, while the Prime Minister is the head of the government.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In India's parliamentary system, the President is the nominal head of state, representing the nation's unity and integrity.  The President's powers are largely exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister is the real head of the government, leading the executive branch and directing the government's policies and actions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of Parliament). This means that the Council must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power.  A vote of no confidence can lead to the resignation or dismissal of the Council.


**19. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can make laws on any subject in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha.
2. Parliament can make laws on any subject in the Concurrent List even if the State Legislature has already made a law on the same subject.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 of the Constitution allows Parliament to make laws on any matter in the State List (subjects under the purview of state governments) in the national interest if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to this effect. This reflects the Centre's power to legislate on matters of national importance even if they fall within the State List.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 254 of the Constitution states that if there is a conflict between a Central law and a State law on a subject in the Concurrent List, the Central law prevails.  Parliament's power to legislate on subjects in the Concurrent List is not restricted by the existence of State legislation on the same subject.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court Judges are appointed by the President of India.
2. The Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Judges of the Supreme Court of India.  However, the President is constitutionally bound to consult the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court Judges before making these appointments.  This consultation process is designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the judicial appointments.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, which includes the power to review its own judgments.  This power allows the Court to correct errors or adapt its decisions to changing circumstances.  However, this power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases.  The Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments is a crucial aspect of its role in upholding the rule of law.


**1. With reference to the recommendations regarding Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposed amendment suggests adding a "Right to rural wage employment for a minimum of 80 days in a year" as a new Fundamental Right.
2.  The existing right to education (Article 21-A) should be modified to include free education until the age of eighteen years for all children, irrespective of gender or caste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions the recommendation to include "Right to rural wage employment for a minimum of 80 days in a year" as a new Fundamental Right. This reflects a focus on social and economic justice, aligning with the broader goals of a welfare state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text advocates for expanding the right to education (Article 21-A), it proposes free education until the age of 14 for all children and until 18 for girls and Scheduled Castes/Tribes.  The statement incorrectly claims that the proposal extends free education to all children until the age of 18.  This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the nuances of proposed amendments.  The difference in age limits for different groups reflects existing social inequalities and the need for targeted interventions.  The recommendation seeks to address these inequalities but doesn't aim for uniform age limits for free education.



**2. With reference to the proposed amendments concerning Directive Principles, consider the following statements:**

1. A new Directive Principle on population control should be added to the existing set of Directive Principles.
2. The existing heading of Part IV of the Constitution, "Directive Principles of State Policy," should be amended to read as "Directive Principles of State Policy and Action."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect recommendations from the provided text. Statement 1 correctly identifies the proposal to introduce a new Directive Principle focusing on population control. This reflects a concern about population growth and its potential impact on resource allocation and sustainable development.  The addition of such a principle would underscore the government's commitment to addressing demographic challenges.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the recommendation to rename Part IV. The suggested change from "Directive Principles of State Policy" to "Directive Principles of State Policy and Action" implies a shift towards greater emphasis on proactive implementation rather than merely stating policy objectives. This subtle change underscores a desire for more concrete action and accountability in achieving the goals outlined in the Directive Principles.


**3. With reference to the proposed changes in the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposed amendments include a new Fundamental Duty to actively participate in the democratic process of governance and to pay taxes.
2.  The recommendations include a new duty for industrial organizations to provide education to the children of their employees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The text clearly outlines the proposed addition of a new Fundamental Duty encompassing active participation in governance and tax payment (Statement 1). This reflects a desire to increase civic engagement and ensure fiscal responsibility. The inclusion of this duty aims to reinforce the citizen's role in upholding the democratic system.

The text also suggests a new Fundamental Duty mandating industrial organizations to provide education to their employees' children (Statement 2).  This recommendation reflects a concern about the education of children from working-class families and aims to improve their access to quality education. This proposal aims to address social inequalities and improve human capital development.



**4. With reference to proposed amendments to the functioning of Parliament and State Legislatures, consider the following statements:**

1. The existing Parliamentary Committees on Estimates, Public Undertakings, and Subordinate Legislation should be discontinued.
2. The MP local area development scheme should be continued.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly recommends discontinuing the existing Parliamentary Committees on Estimates, Public Undertakings, and Subordinate Legislation. This suggestion likely stems from a belief that these committees are no longer effective or that their functions can be better addressed through alternative mechanisms.  Such a recommendation reflects a desire for parliamentary reform and improved efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly recommends discontinuing the MP local area development scheme. This suggests concern about potential misuse of funds or inefficiency in the scheme's implementation. The recommendation to discontinue this scheme indicates a focus on greater transparency and accountability in the allocation and utilization of public resources.



**5.  With reference to proposed reforms in the Executive and Administration, consider the following statements:**

1.  In case of a hung parliament, the Lok Sabha should elect the leader of the House, who would then be appointed as Prime Minister by the President.
2. A motion of no-confidence against a Prime Minister must be accompanied by a proposal for an alternative leader to be voted on simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect proposed reforms mentioned in the text. Statement 1 correctly describes the proposed procedure for electing a Prime Minister in the event of a hung parliament.  This proposal aims to ensure a stable government even in situations where no single party secures a clear majority.  The proposed system would streamline the process of government formation and prevent prolonged political uncertainty.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the proposal for a "constructive vote of no-confidence." This system requires a motion of no-confidence to include a simultaneous proposal for an alternative leader. This reform is aimed at preventing political instability by ensuring that a replacement leader is readily available if the incumbent loses a no-confidence vote.  This approach seeks to maintain governmental stability and continuity.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Backward Classes:**

1. The National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, was repealed by the National Commission for Backward Classes (Repeal) Act, 2018.
2.  The 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018 introduced Article 342-A, empowering the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of the provided text. Statement 1 correctly states that the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, was repealed by the National Commission for Backward Classes (Repeal) Act, 2018. This indicates a significant change in the legal framework governing the commission's functions and authority.  The repeal and subsequent replacement likely reflect a need for updated legislation to address evolving societal needs and concerns.

Statement 2 is also correct in noting that the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018 introduced Article 342-A, granting the President the power to specify socially and educationally backward classes. This amendment represents a significant shift in the constitutional provisions related to the identification and classification of backward classes, impacting social justice and affirmative action policies. The change might be motivated by a need for a more transparent and accountable process for determining backward class status.


**7. With reference to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, consider the following statements:**

1. The office of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities was created in 1957, in accordance with Article 350-B of the Constitution.
2. The Constitution specifies the qualifications, tenure, and removal procedures for the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the office of the Special Officer (later Commissioner) for Linguistic Minorities was established in 1957, following the insertion of Article 350-B into the Constitution. This demonstrates the constitutional basis for protecting the rights of linguistic minorities and the mechanism established to address their concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the Constitution does *not* specify the qualifications, tenure, salaries, allowances, service conditions, or removal procedures for the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. This omission highlights a potential weakness in the constitutional framework, leaving these crucial aspects to be determined through other means, potentially leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities in implementation.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG can be removed from office by the President only on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, following a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament with a special majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the CAG's appointment and removal as detailed in the text. Statement 1 correctly outlines the CAG's appointment process and tenure, emphasizing the constitutional provision for an independent and secure term. This ensures the CAG's impartiality and prevents political interference in their duties.

Statement 2 correctly describes the process for removing the CAG from office, highlighting the need for a rigorous procedure involving both Houses of Parliament and a special majority. This stringent process further safeguards the CAG's independence and prevents arbitrary removal based on political considerations.  The requirement of a special majority emphasizes the seriousness of removing such a crucial constitutional figure.


**9. With reference to the  Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule before April 24, 1973, are not subject to judicial review.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2007 ruling declared that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct according to the provided text. Statement 1 accurately reflects the historical understanding that laws included in the Ninth Schedule before April 24, 1973, enjoyed immunity from judicial review. This provision was initially intended to protect land reforms and other crucial legislation from legal challenges, but it also raised concerns about potential limitations on judicial oversight.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the Supreme Court's 2007 ruling, which established that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are now subject to judicial review. This landmark decision significantly altered the legal landscape, affirming the judiciary's role in ensuring the constitutionality of all laws, even those previously protected by the Ninth Schedule. This ruling reinforced the principle of judicial review and its importance in upholding the Constitution's basic structure.


**10. With reference to the concept of Judicial Activism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Judicial activism is characterized by judges departing from strict adherence to judicial precedent in favor of progressive social policies.
2.  The rise of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India is largely attributed to judicial restraint.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines a key aspect of judicial activism.  It correctly highlights the proactive role of the judiciary in shaping social policy by sometimes deviating from established precedents. This approach reflects a belief that the judiciary should play a more active role in addressing societal issues and ensuring justice, even if it means challenging established legal norms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the rise of PIL in India is largely attributed to *judicial activism*, not judicial restraint.  Judicial activism, through its proactive approach to addressing public concerns, created the environment for the emergence and growth of PIL.  Judicial restraint, on the other hand, emphasizes adherence to precedent and a more limited judicial role, which would be less likely to facilitate the rise of PIL.  The connection between judicial activism and PIL showcases the judiciary's expanded role in societal change.


**1. With reference to the Cultural and Educational Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Linguistic and religious minorities possess the unrestricted right to establish exclusive educational institutions solely for their children, barring admission to any other community.
2. The government bears the obligation to ensure that children belonging to minority groups receive exposure to their respective beliefs and cultural heritage within the framework of public education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 30 of the Indian Constitution grants linguistic and religious minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. However, this right is not absolute.  While they can establish institutions, they cannot completely bar admission to members of the majority community.  The Supreme Court has consistently held that while minorities have a right to preserve their distinct identity, they cannot create completely segregated educational systems.  The state retains the right to regulate educational standards and practices in all institutions, including those run by minorities.

Statement 2 is correct.  While not explicitly stated as a legal obligation in the same manner as the right to establish institutions, the spirit of Article 29 and Article 30 implies a responsibility on the part of the government to foster an inclusive educational environment that respects the cultural and religious diversity of the nation.  This includes ensuring that children from minority groups are not disadvantaged and have opportunities to learn about and preserve their own cultural heritage.  This is a crucial aspect of promoting national integration and preventing discrimination. The government’s role extends to ensuring that the curriculum and educational materials reflect the diversity of Indian society.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the violation of Fundamental Rights in India:**

1. The denial of minimum wages constitutes a violation of the Right to Life (Article 21) as it directly impacts an individual's ability to access basic necessities.
2. The prohibition of a book, solely on the grounds of its content, irrespective of any incitement to violence or public disorder, infringes upon the freedom of speech and expression (Article 19).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has broadened the interpretation of Article 21 (Right to Life) to encompass the right to live with human dignity.  This includes the right to livelihood and access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing.  Denying minimum wages directly undermines an individual's ability to secure these necessities, thereby violating their Right to Life. The right to life is not just about mere survival but also includes a decent standard of living.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 19(1)(a) guarantees freedom of speech and expression.  While this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, decency or morality, a blanket ban on a book solely based on its content without a clear and present danger of incitement to violence or harm is considered a violation of this fundamental right.  The state must demonstrate a compelling reason for such censorship, and the restriction must be proportionate to the threat posed.  Preemptive censorship without due process is generally seen as an infringement of this fundamental right.


**3. With reference to the enforcement of Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 32 of the Constitution empowers only the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, excluding High Courts from this power.
2.  The right to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 can be suspended by the President only during the operation of a National Emergency, with no exceptions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 32 grants the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  However, Article 226 concurrently bestows the same power upon High Courts.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction in this matter, allowing citizens to approach either court for redressal of violations of their fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President can suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of fundamental rights during a national emergency under Article 359, this power is not absolute.  The Constitution explicitly excludes certain rights, such as those guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 (Protection in Respect of Convictions for Offences and Protection of Life and Personal Liberty), from being suspended even during a national emergency.  This highlights the constitutional safeguards for core individual liberties.


**4. With reference to the nature of Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts, while Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts.
2.  The Directive Principles, though non-justiciable, are considered fundamental in the governance of the country and impose a moral obligation on the state to strive for their implementation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy lies in their enforceability. Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning citizens can approach courts to seek their enforcement if violated.  Directive Principles, on the other hand, are non-justiciable; they are not directly enforceable by courts.  This difference reflects the constitutional balance between individual rights and the state's socio-economic goals.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Although not legally enforceable, Directive Principles are considered fundamental in the governance of the country (as enshrined in the Constitution itself).  They represent the state's commitment to achieving social and economic justice and guide the state's policymaking. They impose a moral and political obligation on the state to work towards their implementation, even though they cannot be used as grounds for legal action against the state.  The state's failure to implement them can be subject to public scrutiny and political pressure.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution mandates universal adult suffrage, granting every citizen above the age of 18 the right to vote, regardless of caste, creed, sex, or literacy.
2. The Constitution explicitly defines the term "minority" to clarify which communities are entitled to the rights guaranteed under Articles 29 and 30.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes universal adult franchise as the foundation of its democratic system.  Every citizen who is 18 years of age or older has the right to vote in elections, irrespective of their social, economic, or educational background. This principle of equal voting rights is a cornerstone of Indian democracy.  The right to vote is a crucial component of participatory democracy and ensures that the government is accountable to the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution does not explicitly define the term "minority."  Articles 29 and 30, which deal with the protection of minority interests and their right to establish educational institutions, do not provide a precise definition.  The determination of which communities constitute minorities has been left to judicial interpretation and contextual understanding.  The courts have considered factors like numerical strength and social vulnerability in making this determination, leading to some ambiguity and ongoing debate.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the Emergency Provisions in the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Constitution allows for the declaration of a National Emergency only on the grounds of war or external aggression.
2.  During a proclaimed State Emergency (President's Rule), the powers of the State Legislature are automatically transferred to the Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 352 of the Indian Constitution permits the declaration of a National Emergency not only on the grounds of war or external aggression but also on the grounds of armed rebellion.  This broader definition reflects the potential for internal threats to national security and stability. The decision to proclaim a national emergency rests with the President, but it requires the approval of Parliament.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While a State Emergency (President's Rule), declared under Article 356, allows the central government to assume control of the state's administration, the powers of the State Legislature are not automatically transferred to the Parliament. The State Legislature can be suspended, but the Parliament can only legislate on matters in the State List with the consent of the State Legislature.  The Parliament’s power to legislate on state subjects is limited during a State Emergency. The central government's assumption of power is primarily focused on executive functions, and the legislative powers of the state are not completely transferred to the Parliament.  The state government's functions are suspended, but the State Legislature itself may not be dissolved automatically.



**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Union and State Governments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Council of Ministers in a State is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 155 of the Indian Constitution states that the Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  Article 156 further clarifies that the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This provision reflects the central government's ultimate authority over the states, although in practice, the appointment process often considers the views of the ruling party in the state.

Statement 2 is correct.  The parliamentary system of government operates at both the Union and State levels.  In a state, the Council of Ministers (headed by the Chief Minister) is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly.  This means that the Council of Ministers must retain the confidence of the Assembly; if it loses the confidence of the Assembly, it must resign.  This mechanism of accountability ensures that the state government is responsive to the elected representatives of the people.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the structure and functioning of the Indian Parliament:**

1.  A Money Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha) with the prior recommendation of the President.
2. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of Parliament). The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) can only make recommendations on a Money Bill but cannot amend it or reject it.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters and ensures that the government's budget is not unduly delayed or altered by the Rajya Sabha.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. It can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha within 14 days of receiving the bill.  The Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations.  After 14 days, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses even if the Rajya Sabha has not acted on it.  This specific procedure limits the Rajya Sabha's influence on financial legislation, reflecting the principle of financial control vested primarily with the Lok Sabha.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to freedom of speech and expression (Article 19) includes the freedom of the press but does not encompass the right to commercial advertising.
2. The right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) is available to citizens only and not to non-citizens.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Article 19(1)(a) guarantees freedom of speech and expression, which includes the freedom of the press, the scope of this right has been subject to judicial interpretation.  The Supreme Court has held that the right to freedom of speech and expression does not extend to absolute protection for commercial advertising. This is because commercial speech can be regulated to safeguard against misleading or deceptive advertisements and to maintain ethical standards in advertising practices. The state can impose reasonable restrictions on commercial advertising in the interest of public welfare.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, explicitly extends to all persons within the territory of India, irrespective of citizenship status. This is a significant aspect of the principle of equality before the law, ensuring that fundamental rights are not limited to citizens alone.  Non-citizens are also entitled to the protection of their life and personal liberty, subject to any lawful procedure established by law.  This reflects the broader human rights principles enshrined in the Indian Constitution.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can only give advisory opinions on matters of law or fact if the President specifically requests such an opinion.
2.  The High Courts in India have the power to issue writs, including habeas corpus, for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 143 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to consult the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact of public importance.  The Supreme Court can give an advisory opinion, but only if the President specifically seeks it.  The Supreme Court is not obligated to provide an advisory opinion on its own initiative, and its opinion is not binding on the President or the government.  This advisory jurisdiction is distinct from the Supreme Court's judicial powers.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 226 of the Indian Constitution grants High Courts the power to issue writs, including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.  This power extends to the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, allowing High Courts to intervene in cases of alleged violations of these rights.  This concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court (under Article 32) provides citizens with multiple avenues for seeking judicial redressal.  The High Courts play a vital role in protecting fundamental rights at the state level.


**1. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can introduce a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations on a Money Bill within 14 days of its receipt, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters. The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and offer suggestions, not to initiate or veto such legislation. This limitation underscores the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution explicitly grants the Rajya Sabha the sole power to initiate the process for the removal of the Vice-President. This is a unique and exclusive power not shared with the Lok Sabha. It highlights a specific area where the Rajya Sabha plays a crucial, independent role. The process involves a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President can be impeached by a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha alone.
2. The President appoints the Prime Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The impeachment of the President requires a special procedure involving both Houses of Parliament. The Rajya Sabha cannot act alone in this regard.  A resolution for impeachment must be passed by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting in each House. This demonstrates the checks and balances built into the process to prevent hasty or arbitrary removal.  The process highlights the importance of consensus and due process in removing such a high-ranking constitutional figure.

Statement 2 is correct, but with a nuance. While the President formally appoints the Prime Minister, the process is largely conventional.  The person who commands the majority in the Lok Sabha is appointed Prime Minister, reflecting the principle of parliamentary accountability. The President's role in this instance is largely ceremonial, although the President has the power to appoint someone if no clear majority exists. This illustrates the interplay between the executive and legislative branches in the Indian political system.


**3. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject the Union Budget.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss and suggest amendments, but it cannot reject the Budget.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary responsibility for approving the nation's finances. The Lok Sabha's control over financial matters is a key feature of India's parliamentary system and safeguards the government's ability to function effectively.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject the Union Budget.  It can only review and suggest amendments to the budget, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on the Budget, highlighting its crucial role in the financial governance of the nation.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role in this context is a key aspect of the Indian constitutional framework.


**4. With reference to the Financial Bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce a Financial Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Financial Bill but cannot reject it.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, with a crucial distinction.  While all Money Bills *must* originate in the Lok Sabha, Financial Bills (other than Money Bills) can be introduced in either House. However,  Financial Bills that involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India require the President's recommendation. This distinction demonstrates the nuanced approach to financial legislation within the Indian system.  The Lok Sabha's primacy in Money Bills reflects its role as the directly elected House representing the people's will in financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha can propose amendments to a Financial Bill (excluding Money Bills), but it cannot reject it outright.  The Lok Sabha can then accept or reject these amendments.  This underscores the Rajya Sabha's role as a revising chamber, not a vetoing one, in financial legislation. This balance of power between the two Houses is a key element of the Indian parliamentary system, preventing either House from having absolute control over financial legislation.


**5. With reference to the composition of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha represents the states, while the Lok Sabha represents the people.
2. The total number of members in the Rajya Sabha is fixed by the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha is designed to represent the states, with members elected by state legislatures. The Lok Sabha, on the other hand, is directly elected by the people of India. This bicameral structure reflects the federal nature of the Indian polity, with representation for both the states and the people.  The difference in the composition of the two Houses is a cornerstone of the Indian constitutional system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution specifies the *maximum* number of members in the Rajya Sabha (250), but not a fixed number. The actual number of members is determined by Parliament through legislation, based on the representation of various states. This flexibility allows for adjustments in representation as the country's demographics change. This provision reflects the dynamic nature of the Indian political system and its ability to adapt to evolving circumstances.


**6. With reference to the process of law-making in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill passed by the Lok Sabha can become law even if the Rajya Sabha rejects it.
2. The President of India has the power to veto a bill passed by both Houses of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, but only for Money Bills. For ordinary bills, a joint sitting of both Houses can be called to resolve disagreements.  For Money Bills, however, the Lok Sabha has the final say. The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a critical aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, ensuring that the government can function effectively.  This reflects the democratic principle of the directly elected House having greater control over financial legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to either assent to a bill passed by Parliament, withhold assent, or return the bill for reconsideration.  This power, however, is rarely exercised, and a returned bill, if passed again by Parliament, must be signed into law.  The President's power to veto acts as a check on legislative overreach, safeguarding the balance of power among the different branches of government. This provision is crucial for maintaining the checks and balances in the Indian system.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Parliament:**

1. Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution.
2. Parliament can create new All-India Services.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution through a special majority. This power, however, is subject to limitations, as some parts of the Constitution are considered basic structure and cannot be altered.  The Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is a fundamental aspect of its sovereignty.  This highlights the legislative supremacy of the Parliament in relation to the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament is empowered to create new All-India Services through legislation.  This power is crucial for ensuring uniformity and efficiency in the administration of the country. This power reflects the Parliament's role in shaping the administrative structure of the nation and maintaining a balance between the center and the states. The Rajya Sabha has a special role in this process.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and enjoys a high degree of independence. This independence is crucial for ensuring that the CAG can perform its duties without political interference. The appointment process underscores the importance of safeguarding the CAG's impartiality and objectivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's wide-ranging audit responsibilities are essential for maintaining financial accountability across the entire country.  The CAG's audits are crucial for ensuring transparency and good governance at both the central and state levels.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures, providing oversight and accountability.


**9. With reference to the emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  A proclamation of National Emergency must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within one month.
2. During a National Emergency, fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 20 are suspended.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**


Statement 1 is largely correct. A proclamation of National Emergency must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within one month. If the Lok Sabha is dissolved, approval by only Rajya Sabha is needed. However, the time limit for approval may be extended under certain circumstances.  This provision highlights the importance of parliamentary oversight in matters of national security. The requirement of parliamentary approval emphasizes the constitutional balance of power between the executive and legislature.  The time limit emphasizes the urgency and the need for timely action during an emergency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While certain fundamental rights can be suspended during a National Emergency, Articles 19 and 20 are not automatically suspended.  The suspension of rights is subject to specific conditions and limitations, reflecting the constitutional commitment to protecting fundamental rights even during emergencies.  The selective suspension of rights during a National Emergency reflects a careful balancing act between the need for national security and the protection of individual freedoms.  The specific rights that can be suspended are outlined in the Constitution.


**10. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to frame policies and legislation. The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles reflects a deliberate constitutional choice to balance individual rights with social and economic goals.  This distinction is important for understanding the role and limitations of the Directive Principles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice.  They provide a framework for the state to work towards the betterment of society.  The Directive Principles are a key element of India's constitutional commitment to social justice and welfare. The principles reflect the country's commitment to social and economic equality.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners as the President may from time to time fix.

2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India's composition is defined by Article 324 of the Indian Constitution. It mandates a Chief Election Commissioner and allows the President to appoint additional Election Commissioners as needed.  The number of Election Commissioners is not fixed constitutionally and can vary depending on the requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body, is solely responsible for deciding the election schedule for general and by-elections.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does not have any role in this crucial aspect of the electoral process. The independence of the Election Commission is vital to ensure free and fair elections, free from executive interference. The schedule is a matter of its own discretion and expertise.  Any involvement of the Home Ministry would compromise this independence and potentially lead to biased election timing.


**2. Consider the following statements about the President's rule in a State:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule in a State automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.

2. The removal of the Council of Ministers in a State is a necessary consequence of the proclamation of President's rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While President's rule (Article 356) often results in the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not automatic.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, particularly if there's a possibility of forming a stable government soon. The decision rests on the assessment of the situation and the likelihood of restoring constitutional governance without dissolving the Assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The removal of the Council of Ministers is a common outcome of President's rule, as the existing government is deemed incapable of governing the State. However, it's not constitutionally mandatory.  The President might choose to allow the existing Council of Ministers to continue in a caretaker capacity until a new government can be formed or the Assembly is dissolved. The focus is on restoring stability and constitutional order; the removal of the Council of Ministers is a tool towards this, but not an absolute requirement.


**3. With reference to Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by the unequal representation of federating units in the Rajya Sabha.

2. The establishment of the Indian federal system was the result of an agreement among the federating units.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key feature of Indian federalism is the unequal representation of states in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  States are allocated seats based on their population, leading to disparities in representation. This reflects a compromise between a purely population-based representation and considerations of regional balance. Larger states have more representation, while smaller states have fewer seats, ensuring that no single state dominates the upper house.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian federal system wasn't established through an agreement among federating units. It emerged from the Government of India Act of 1935, which laid the groundwork for a federal structure, and the subsequent adoption of the Indian Constitution. While there were negotiations and discussions involving various stakeholders, it was ultimately a constitutional framework imposed, not a negotiated agreement among equal partners. The process was shaped by historical contexts, political power dynamics, and the vision of the framers of the Constitution.


**4. With reference to the Parliament of India's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament utilizes adjournment motions primarily to express disapproval of government policies and actions.

2. Supplementary questions during Question Hour provide a mechanism for detailed scrutiny of government responses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Adjournment motions, though rarely successful in bringing down a government, serve as a powerful tool for the opposition to express strong disapproval of government policies or actions.  They highlight urgent issues demanding immediate attention and can lead to heated debates and critical scrutiny of the government's stance.  While they don't directly remove the government, they can create political pressure and potentially damage the government's image.

Statement 2 is correct. Supplementary questions, following the initial answers during Question Hour, enable detailed probing of government responses. They allow members to clarify ambiguities, challenge claims, and demand more comprehensive information. This mechanism facilitates in-depth scrutiny of government actions and policies, ensuring accountability and transparency.  The ability to ask follow-up questions is a crucial aspect of parliamentary oversight.



**5. With reference to Private Member's Bills in the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a member of the government.

2.  A private member's bill has never been passed in the Parliament of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is introduced by an MP who is not a minister in the government.  These bills often address issues not prioritized by the ruling party or reflect the concerns of specific sections of society.  While they face significant challenges in passage, they play a role in shaping public discourse and potentially influencing government policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While private member's bills are rarely passed, they have been passed in the Parliament of India's history.  The success rate is low due to limited time allocated and the dominance of government business, but it is not impossible for a private member's bill to become law.  The passage requires significant political support and favorable circumstances.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Vote in India:**

1. The right to vote in India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.

2.  The right to be elected to the Parliament or State Legislatures is also a fundamental right.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The right to vote in India is a legal right, flowing from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and 1951, not a fundamental right under Part III of the Constitution. While it's essential for a functioning democracy, it's not constitutionally entrenched as a fundamental right. The Constitution implicitly supports this right, but it is not explicitly guaranteed in Part III.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to be elected is also not a fundamental right.  It's a legal right subject to certain qualifications and procedures outlined in laws like the Representation of the People Act.  While the Constitution establishes the framework for elections, it doesn't explicitly declare the right to be elected as a fundamental right.  This is to prevent any abuse of the right to stand for election.


**7. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes an independent judiciary as a key feature of its federal structure.

2.  The powers are divided between the Centre and the States based on a clear and mutually exclusive division of subjects.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An independent judiciary is a cornerstone of Indian federalism. It acts as an arbiter between the Centre and the States, ensuring that neither encroaches on the powers allocated to the other.  The judiciary's role in interpreting the Constitution and upholding its provisions is crucial for maintaining the balance of power in the federal structure. The judicial review power is a key federal feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indian Constitution divides powers between the Centre and the States, the division isn't entirely mutually exclusive.  The Concurrent List contains subjects where both the Centre and the States can legislate, potentially leading to overlaps and conflicts.  Moreover, the Centre's power under Articles 249 and 250 to legislate on State subjects under specific circumstances further complicates the clarity of the division. The distribution of powers is complex and not always clearly defined.



**8. Consider the following statements regarding Local Self-Government in India:**

1.  Local self-government is best understood as an exercise in administrative delegation.

2. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments primarily aim at strengthening local self-government through democratic decentralization.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Local self-government is not merely administrative delegation. It involves transferring significant powers and responsibilities to locally elected bodies, empowering them to manage local affairs.  It is about empowering local communities.  Administrative delegation would involve simply assigning tasks to lower-level officials; local self-government is a more profound concept.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd (Panchayats) and 74th (Municipalities) Constitutional Amendments are landmark legislation aiming to strengthen local self-government through democratic decentralization.  They provide constitutional status to these institutions, mandate periodic elections, and grant them specific powers and responsibilities.  The objective is to deepen democracy by bringing governance closer to the people.


**9. With reference to Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review in India empowers the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by the legislature.

2. The Indian judiciary can question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature through judicial review.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Judicial review is a fundamental feature of the Indian Constitution. It allows the judiciary to examine laws passed by the legislature and determine their constitutionality.  If a law violates the Constitution, the judiciary can strike it down, ensuring that the Constitution remains supreme. This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While judicial review allows the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws, it does not grant the power to judge the wisdom or policy choices behind the legislation.  The judiciary's role is limited to ensuring that the law is consistent with the Constitution, not to evaluate its effectiveness or desirability. The legislature is responsible for policy decisions; the judiciary ensures legality.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Indian Parliamentary System:**

1. The executive and legislature work independently in the Indian parliamentary system.

2. The main advantage of the parliamentary system is that the executive remains responsible to the legislature.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian parliamentary system is characterized by a close relationship between the executive and the legislature.  The executive (the Council of Ministers) is drawn from the legislature (Parliament) and is accountable to it.  The legislature has the power to remove the government through a vote of no confidence.  The independence of the judiciary ensures that the executive does not become all-powerful.

Statement 2 is correct. The executive's accountability to the legislature is the major strength of the parliamentary system.  It ensures that the government acts in accordance with the wishes of the elected representatives and is responsive to public opinion.  This accountability mechanism helps prevent arbitrary actions and promotes good governance.  The system provides checks and balances.


**11. With reference to the Aadhaar Card, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar card can be used as a proof of citizenship or domicile.

2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or omitted by the issuing authority.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is a unique identification number, not a proof of citizenship or domicile. While it can be used as an identity document for various purposes, it does not establish citizenship or residency status.  Proof of citizenship or domicile requires separate documentation. Aadhaar is just a unique identity number.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) has the power to deactivate or cancel Aadhaar numbers under specific circumstances, such as detection of fraudulent enrollment or violation of privacy policies.  The issuing authority retains control over the Aadhaar number to maintain the integrity and security of the system.  The number can be cancelled or blocked if it is misused.


**12. With reference to the Right to Privacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original Constitution of India.

2. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the original Constitution of India.  However, the Supreme Court of India has recognized it as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct. In the landmark *Puttaswamy* judgment (2017), the Supreme Court of India recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, intrinsically linked to Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).  The Court held that privacy is an essential component of a meaningful life and is protected by the Constitution.  This ruling has significant implications for various aspects of personal liberty and data protection.


**13. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The value of the vote of each MLA is uniform across all states.

2.  The value of the vote of MPs of the Lok Sabha is higher than the value of the vote of MPs of the Rajya Sabha.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The value of the vote of each MLA varies from state to state.  It's calculated based on the population of the state and is not uniform.  Larger states have MLAs with higher vote values, reflecting their larger populations. The electoral college is weighted to reflect population differences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The value of the vote of MPs from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha is calculated differently but is not such that the Lok Sabha MP has higher vote value than the Rajya Sabha MP. The value of a vote of an MP is calculated by dividing the total population of the state by the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The value of the vote of an MLA in a state is calculated by dividing the total population of the state by the total number of seats in the state legislative assembly.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Governor of a State:**

1. No criminal proceedings shall be instituted against the Governor of a State in any court during his term of office.

2. The emoluments and allowances of the Governor of a State shall not be diminished during his term of office.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor enjoys certain immunities, he is not completely immune from criminal proceedings during his term.  He can be prosecuted if the President gives his consent for the prosecution.  The immunity is not absolute.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 158 of the Constitution explicitly states that the emoluments and allowances of the Governor shall not be diminished during his term of office. This provision safeguards the Governor's financial security and ensures his independence.  It prevents any political manipulation through financial pressure.


**15. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements about Parliamentary Committees:**

1. The Committee on Government Assurances scrutinizes whether the assurances given by ministers on the floor of the House are fulfilled.

2. The Rules Committee is responsible for scrutinizing and reporting to the House on whether the powers to make regulations, rules, sub-rules, by-laws, etc., are being properly exercised by the executive.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances plays a crucial role in ensuring accountability by monitoring whether ministers keep the promises made in Parliament.  It examines the progress made on assurances and reports to the House, keeping the executive in check.  This committee is essential for maintaining government credibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation, not the Rules Committee, scrutinizes the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive and reports to the House on whether they are within the scope of the delegation.  The Rules Committee deals with the rules and procedures of the House itself, not with the executive's rule-making powers.  The two committees have distinct functions.


**16. Consider the following statements about the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly:**

1. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly shall vacate his/her office if he/she ceases to be a member of the Assembly.

2. The Speaker shall vacate his/her office immediately when the Legislative Assembly is dissolved.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Speaker's position is contingent upon his/her membership in the Assembly. If the Speaker ceases to be a member (e.g., through resignation or disqualification), he/she automatically vacates the Speaker's office. This ensures that the Speaker always represents the Assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Speaker's office becomes vacant upon dissolution of the Assembly, it's not an immediate vacation.  The Speaker continues to hold office until the next Assembly is constituted.  This allows for continuity and orderly transition.  The Speaker maintains certain functions even after dissolution.


**17. With reference to the exercise of the President's power under Article 356 of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Assembly.

2.  The President can make laws relating to that State during the period of President's rule.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 doesn't automatically dissolve the State Assembly.  The President can choose to dissolve the Assembly or allow it to continue depending on the circumstances.  The decision is not automatic.

Statement 2 is correct. During President's rule, Parliament can make laws for the State, as the State Legislature's powers are suspended.  This is a crucial provision to ensure that the State's administration continues during a constitutional crisis.  Parliament's power to legislate for the State during President's rule is a key aspect of the Article 356 mechanism.


**18. Consider the following statements about the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution:**

1. The Parliament can place any law in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.

2. The validity of a law placed in the Ninth Schedule cannot be challenged in any court.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule.  This power has been used extensively to protect laws from judicial scrutiny.  However, the Supreme Court has placed limits on this power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ninth Schedule was initially intended to protect laws from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that even laws in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is supreme.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the relationship between law and liberty:**

1. More laws always imply less liberty.

2.  The absence of laws results in the absence of liberty.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between law and liberty is complex.  While excessive or unjust laws can restrict liberty, well-crafted laws are essential for protecting individual freedoms.  Laws can both limit and protect liberty.  The nature and quality of the laws are crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The absence of laws doesn't automatically mean the absence of liberty.  It can lead to anarchy and the violation of individual rights.  Laws are necessary to establish a framework for order and protection of rights.  Liberty is best preserved through a system of just and fair laws.


**20. With reference to the Rule of Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rule of Law implies the limitation of powers of all organs of the state.

2. The Rule of Law necessarily implies that people are responsible to the government.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core principle of the Rule of Law is that all organs of the state, including the legislature, executive, and judiciary, are subject to legal constraints and limitations. No organ is above the law.  This ensures accountability and prevents arbitrary exercise of power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rule of Law emphasizes the government's accountability to the law, not the people's responsibility to the government.  While citizens have responsibilities, the Rule of Law focuses on the government's obligation to uphold the law and respect individual rights.  The focus is on the government's conduct, not the citizen's.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliament's control over the Executive:**

1. The Parliament exercises control over the Executive through question hour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion, censure motion, and other discussions.
2.  Parliamentary committees, such as the Committee on Government Assurances and the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, also supervise the Executive's activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indian Parliament's mechanisms for controlling the Executive branch.  Statement 1 correctly lists various parliamentary tools used to scrutinize government actions and hold ministers accountable. These tools allow for questioning of government policies, debates on specific issues, and even the ultimate sanction of a no-confidence motion. Statement 2 highlights the role of parliamentary committees, which provide a more in-depth and sustained oversight of executive actions.  These committees examine specific areas of government activity, scrutinize legislation, and provide reports to the Parliament. Therefore, both statements are true and accurately represent the multifaceted nature of parliamentary control.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the comprehensive nature of parliamentary oversight, which involves both direct floor actions and committee-based scrutiny.


**2. With reference to the Parliament's financial powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament's financial control operates in two stages: budgetary control (before appropriation of grants) and post-budgetary control (after appropriation of grants through financial committees).
2. The "rule of lapse" ensures that any unspent money granted to the government for a financial year expires and returns to the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament's control over the government's finances is a crucial aspect of its oversight function. Statement 1 accurately describes the two-stage process.  Budgetary control involves the Parliament's approval of the budget before funds are allocated. Post-budgetary control, exercised through committees like the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee, involves scrutinizing the government's spending after the fact to ensure accountability and efficiency.  Statement 2 correctly describes the "rule of lapse," a key principle of parliamentary financial control. This rule prevents the government from accumulating unapproved reserve funds and forces it to utilize allocated resources within the given financial year.  Therefore, both statements are correct and reflect the comprehensive nature of Parliament's financial powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to capture the two-stage control process and the significance of the rule of lapse in maintaining fiscal discipline.


**3. With reference to the Parliament's constituent powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any provision of the Constitution, except those forming its "basic structure," as defined by the Supreme Court.
2.  The Parliament can amend the Constitution through simple, special, or special majority with the consent of half of all state legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is a significant aspect of its role. Statement 1 accurately reflects the limitations on this power.  While the Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, the Supreme Court has established the concept of "basic structure," which designates certain fundamental features of the Constitution that cannot be altered.  This judicially created limitation ensures the Constitution's core principles remain intact. Statement 2 correctly outlines the different types of majorities required for constitutional amendments.  The Constitution allows for amendments through simple majority, special majority, and special majority with the concurrence of at least half of the state legislatures.  Thus, both statements are true and accurately reflect the Parliament's constituent power and its constraints.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to account for both the limitations and the diverse procedural aspects of constitutional amendment.


**4. With reference to the Parliament's judicial powers and functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can impeach the President for violation of the Constitution.
2. The Parliament can remove the Vice-President from office through a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha and agreed to by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament possesses certain judicial powers, primarily related to accountability of high constitutional office holders. Statement 1 is correct; the Constitution empowers Parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President for violating the Constitution.  This process involves a specific procedure outlined in the Constitution and requires a two-thirds majority in both Houses. Statement 2 is also correct; the Vice-President can be removed from office through a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe the Parliament's role in holding these high officials accountable. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the Parliament's power in both impeachment and removal processes.


**5. With reference to the Lok Sabha's control over the Executive, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha can express its lack of confidence in the government by rejecting a money bill.
2. The Lok Sabha can remove the Council of Ministers by passing a no-confidence motion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament and directly elected by the people, holds significant power in relation to the Executive.  Statement 1 is correct; the rejection of a money bill by the Lok Sabha is a powerful expression of no confidence, potentially leading to the government's downfall.  The government's ability to pass its budget is essential for its continued functioning. Statement 2 is also correct; the Lok Sabha can use a no-confidence motion to remove the Council of Ministers. This motion, if passed by a simple majority, compels the government to resign. Thus, both statements correctly describe the mechanisms through which the Lok Sabha can assert its control over the Executive. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the dual mechanisms – rejection of money bills and no-confidence motions – for expressing lack of confidence and removing the government.


**6. With reference to the Rajya Sabha's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in the introduction and passage of ordinary bills and constitutional amendment bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, though less powerful than the Lok Sabha in financial matters, possesses significant legislative and other powers.  Statement 1 is correct; the Rajya Sabha shares equal powers with the Lok Sabha in the introduction and passage of most bills, including ordinary bills and constitutional amendment bills, although in case of a deadlock, the Lok Sabha's decision prevails. Statement 2 is also correct;  the Rajya Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President. This reflects its role in the accountability of high constitutional office holders.  Therefore, both statements are true and accurately represent the Rajya Sabha's powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize that the Rajya Sabha has significant powers despite not being the dominant house.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding delegated legislation:**

1. Delegated legislation refers to rules and regulations made by the executive, which are placed before the Parliament for examination.
2. The increased recourse to delegated legislation has reduced the Parliament's role in making detailed laws and increased the bureaucracy's powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Delegated legislation, where the Parliament delegates law-making powers to the executive, is a complex aspect of governance. Statement 1 is correct;  delegated legislation involves the executive branch creating rules and regulations based on powers granted by the Parliament. These are usually subject to parliamentary scrutiny, though the extent of this scrutiny can vary. Statement 2 is also correct; the increasing use of delegated legislation has led to concerns about a reduction in Parliament's direct law-making role and an expansion of the bureaucracy's influence. This is because the detailed aspects of law implementation are often left to the executive, potentially reducing transparency and accountability.  Therefore, both statements are true and reflect the challenges associated with delegated legislation. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize both the process and the potential consequences of delegated legislation.


**8. With reference to the parliamentary committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's report on the appropriation accounts and ascertains whether the funds voted by Parliament are spent within the scope of the demand.
2. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines whether the powers to make rules and regulations delegated by the Parliament are properly exercised by the executive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary committees play a crucial role in overseeing the government's actions. Statement 1 is correct; the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a crucial financial oversight committee.  It examines the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report, which audits government spending, to ensure that funds allocated by Parliament are used appropriately and efficiently. Statement 2 is also correct; the Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes the executive's exercise of delegated legislative powers. It ensures that the executive branch acts within the limits set by Parliament when creating rules and regulations.  Therefore, both statements are accurate descriptions of the functions of these important parliamentary committees. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the distinct but related roles of these two key committees.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the impeachment of the President:**

1. The Lok Sabha can initiate the impeachment process.
2.  A two-thirds majority in both Houses is required for the President's removal from office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The impeachment of the President is a significant constitutional process. Statement 1 is correct; the Lok Sabha can initiate the impeachment process by passing a resolution with a special majority. This resolution, if passed, is then sent to the Rajya Sabha for consideration. Statement 2 is also correct;  the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the total membership of each House present and voting to remove the President from office. This high threshold ensures that the removal is not a simple political maneuver.  Both statements are thus accurate descriptions of the impeachment process. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, as they fail to recognize the dual role of both houses of Parliament in this significant constitutional process.


**10. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without Parliament's authorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a central aspect of India's fiscal policy and parliamentary control. Statement 1 is largely correct. While various departments contribute, the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in the preparation of the Union Budget, though the Finance Ministry has overall responsibility.  Statement 2 is definitively correct; the Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This ensures that the government's spending is subject to parliamentary approval.  Thus, both statements, with a minor clarification on statement 1, represent accurate aspects of the Union Budget process. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the importance of parliamentary authorization for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.


**11. With reference to the powers of the state legislature, consider the following statements:**

1. The state legislative assembly has the exclusive power to introduce and pass money bills.
2. The state legislative council cannot amend or reject a money bill but can return it to the assembly with or without recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The powers of the state legislature, especially concerning financial matters, mirror the structure at the national level. Statement 1 is correct; only the state legislative assembly (the lower house) can introduce and pass money bills. This reflects the principle that the house directly elected by the people has primary control over financial matters.  Statement 2 is also correct; the state legislative council (the upper house), if present, cannot amend or reject a money bill. It can only return the bill to the assembly with or without recommendations within a specified timeframe.  The assembly then has the final say.  Therefore, both statements are true and accurately depict the distribution of powers concerning money bills in state legislatures. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the specific powers and limitations of both the assembly and the council.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor's powers:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister.
2. The Governor can reserve a state bill for the President's consideration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state plays a significant constitutional role, though primarily a ceremonial one. Statement 1 is correct; the Governor appoints the Chief Minister, usually the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislative assembly.  This reflects the Governor's role in forming the state government. Statement 2 is also correct; the Governor possesses the power to reserve a state bill for the President's consideration.  This is a significant power, allowing for review of potentially controversial legislation.  Both statements are accurate depictions of the Governor's constitutional powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the Governor's role in both appointing the Chief Minister and reserving state bills.


**13. With reference to the CAG, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is an independent constitutional authority crucial for financial accountability. Statement 1 is correct; the President appoints the CAG, emphasizing the office's independence from the executive branch.  Statement 2 is also correct; the CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and state governments, ensuring transparency and accountability in public spending.  Therefore, both statements are true and correctly describe the CAG's appointment and functions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the CAG's independent constitutional status and its crucial role in auditing both Union and state government accounts.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles spell out the socioeconomic goals of the Indian state.
2. The Directive Principles are enforceable by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are a significant part of the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct; the Directive Principles outline the socioeconomic goals and aspirations of the Indian state. They aim to guide the state's policies toward achieving social justice, economic equality, and welfare. Statement 2 is incorrect; unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by courts. They are considered non-justiciable, meaning courts cannot compel the state to implement them.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to differentiate between the nature and enforceability of Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights.


**15. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body.
2. The UPSC's functions are primarily advisory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is a crucial institution for recruitment and personnel management in the Indian government. Statement 1 is correct; the UPSC is established by the Constitution, giving it a constitutional status and ensuring its independence. Statement 2 is also largely correct; while the UPSC's recommendations are not binding, they are given significant weight by the government. The government's decisions on appointments and other personnel matters are usually based on the UPSC's advice, making its role primarily advisory but highly influential. Therefore, both statements accurately describe the UPSC's nature and function. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the UPSC's constitutional status and its influential advisory role.



**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body constituted by the Parliament.
2. The Election Commission of India resolves disputes related to the delimitation of constituencies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Constitution.  It's not a creation of Parliament; its existence and powers are directly derived from the Constitution.  While Parliament can amend the relevant articles concerning the Election Commission, it didn't create the body itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is primarily responsible for conducting free and fair elections.  Delimitation of constituencies is a separate process handled by the Delimitation Commission, which is constituted by a separate Act of Parliament under the Delimitation Act.  The Election Commission doesn't have the authority to resolve disputes related to delimitation. The Election Commission's role is to conduct elections within the delimited constituencies.


**2. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal structure is characterized by a highly centralized system, with significant powers vested in the Union Government.
2. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and acts as a representative of the Union Government in the State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While India is a federation, its structure leans towards a centralized system.  The Union List contains many crucial subjects, and the Union Government holds considerable power in areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency.  The Union's power to intervene in state matters through Articles 356 and 360 further emphasizes this centralized tendency.  However, it is crucial to note that the Indian federal system is not purely centralized; states possess significant autonomy on matters listed in the State List.  The statement accurately reflects the dominant aspect of centralization.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  The Governor's role includes acting as the constitutional head of the State and representing the Union Government.  While the Governor has certain discretionary powers, their primary function is to ensure that the State government operates within the constitutional framework. This role significantly reinforces the Union's influence in state governance. The Governor's position acts as a link between the Union and State governments.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, by a simple majority.
2. The Parliament cannot legislate on matters explicitly reserved for the States in the State List without a specific constitutional amendment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution can be amended by a special majority, not a simple majority. Article 368 outlines the procedure for constitutional amendments, which typically requires a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Parliament and, in some cases, ratification by the State Legislatures.  Fundamental Rights, being a cornerstone of the Constitution, are not easily amendable by a simple majority.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Constitution follows a system of divided powers, wherein subjects are categorized into the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.  The Parliament's legislative power is restricted to those subjects enumerated in the Union List and Concurrent List.  To legislate on subjects in the State List, a specific constitutional amendment is needed, transferring the power to the Union or making it a Concurrent List subject.  Without such an amendment, the Parliament lacks the authority to interfere in State-specific matters.


**4. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can review its own judgments.
2. The High Courts in India have original, appellate, and advisory jurisdictions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court, has the power of judicial review, which includes reviewing its own previous decisions. This power is crucial for maintaining consistency and adapting to changing circumstances. While the Supreme Court is cautious in exercising this power, it retains the ultimate authority to correct its own judgments if deemed necessary.

Statement 2 is correct.  High Courts in India have a wide range of jurisdictions. They exercise original jurisdiction in certain cases (e.g., writ petitions), appellate jurisdiction in appeals from lower courts, and advisory jurisdiction when consulted by the Governor or the President on matters of law.  This broad jurisdiction enables High Courts to effectively administer justice at the state level.  The diverse jurisdiction ensures that High Courts are not limited to a single type of case but can handle a wide spectrum of judicial matters.


**5. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law.
2. DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India by promoting social and economic justice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  DPSPs are not justiciable, unlike Fundamental Rights.  They are not directly enforceable in courts of law.  While they serve as guidelines for the government's policies, courts cannot compel the government to implement them.  The government is expected to strive to realize the principles outlined in the DPSPs, but there is no legal recourse if they are not fully implemented.

Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs form a crucial part of the Indian Constitution, aiming to guide the state towards establishing a welfare state. They seek to promote social and economic justice by addressing issues like equality, social security, education, healthcare, and environmental protection. These principles serve as a moral compass for the government, guiding its policies and actions towards a more equitable and just society.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament.
2. The President's term is for a period of six years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India holds the highest office in the country and can be removed only through a process of impeachment.  Article 61 of the Constitution outlines this procedure, which requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.  This rigorous process protects the President's office from arbitrary removal and safeguards the stability of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India's term is for five years, not six.  While the President can serve more than one term, each term is limited to a five-year period. This fixed term ensures that the presidential office is not held indefinitely and facilitates a peaceful transfer of power.  The fixed term contributes to the stability and predictability of the Indian political system.


**7. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2. Fundamental Rights are available only to citizens of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  These restrictions are usually defined in the articles themselves that guarantee the rights or through subsequent laws passed by Parliament.  The balance between individual liberties and societal needs is carefully considered.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many Fundamental Rights are primarily available to citizens, some, like the right to equality and the right against exploitation, are also applicable to non-citizens within the territory of India. The scope and application of Fundamental Rights have been interpreted by the Supreme Court to encompass certain rights for non-citizens as well.  The interpretation of Fundamental Rights acknowledges the presence of non-citizens within the Indian legal framework.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually to the Parliament by the Finance Minister.
2. The Union Budget needs to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before it can be implemented.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, a comprehensive financial statement of the government's revenues and expenditures, is presented annually to the Parliament by the Finance Minister. This presentation marks the beginning of the budgetary process, which involves detailed scrutiny and debate within Parliament.  The presentation of the Budget is a formal constitutional requirement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Union Budget must receive the approval of both Houses of Parliament before it comes into effect. This approval process involves detailed examination of the Budget's provisions by parliamentary committees and debates in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The parliamentary approval ensures that the government's financial plans are subject to democratic scrutiny and control.  The approval process is a key element of parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**9. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.
2. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an absolute power.  The Governor usually acts on the advice of the Chief Minister.  There are certain circumstances where the Governor might exercise their discretion, but generally, the dissolution is a consequence of political decisions within the state.  The Governor's power is constrained by constitutional norms and conventions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  This appointment signifies the Governor's role as a representative of the Union Government at the state level.  The appointment process reflects the federal structure of India, wherein the Union plays a role in the selection of the head of the state government.  The President's role in appointing the Governor is a constitutional requirement.


**10.  With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 introduced Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats.  This Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad) in all states, aiming to decentralize power and enhance local governance. The three-tier structure is intended to ensure effective representation at various levels.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha, as defined by the 73rd Amendment, is a body composed of all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village within the Panchayat's area.  It serves as a forum for local participation in decision-making, promoting grassroots democracy.  The Gram Sabha plays a vital role in local development planning and implementation.  The composition of the Gram Sabha is clearly defined within the constitutional framework.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the composition of the Rajya Sabha:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has 250 members, of which 12 are nominated by the President.
2.  Members of the Rajya Sabha are elected indirectly by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, has a maximum strength of 250 members.  Of these, 12 members are nominated by the President of India for their expertise in specific fields like literature, science, art, and social service. This nomination ensures representation of specialized knowledge and expertise in the Parliament.

Statement 2 is also correct. Unlike the Lok Sabha, whose members are directly elected by the people, the Rajya Sabha members are elected indirectly.  Each state sends representatives to the Rajya Sabha, with the number of representatives proportional to the state's population. The elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) of each state cast votes to elect the Rajya Sabha members representing that state.  This indirect election system is a key feature distinguishing the Rajya Sabha from the Lok Sabha and reflects the federal structure of the Indian polity.  The system aims to balance the representation of states in the Parliament while providing a forum for diverse perspectives.


**2. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister on the first day of February.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend Money Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While there have been variations in the past,  the Union Budget is traditionally presented to the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister. Since 2017, the presentation has been shifted to the 1st of February. The exact date might vary slightly depending on the calendar year.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha, the Council of States, does not have the power to amend Money Bills.  Money Bills, which deal primarily with financial matters like taxation, borrowing, and appropriation of funds, are exclusively the domain of the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only offer recommendations or suggestions on a Money Bill within a stipulated time frame, but the Lok Sabha has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations.  This restriction on the Rajya Sabha's power reflects the Lok Sabha's greater role in controlling the government's finances.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, with a special majority.
2.  The Parliament can create new All-India Services with the concurrence of the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it is not entirely unrestricted. The Supreme Court has established the doctrine of "basic structure," which limits the Parliament's amending power.  Certain fundamental aspects of the Constitution, such as its federal character, secular nature, and democratic principles, cannot be altered or abolished through amendments.  Therefore, the Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution without constraint.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament of India has the power to create new All-India Services (AIS). However, this power is not absolute and requires the specific approval of the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha’s role in this process underscores the federal nature of the Indian polity, ensuring that the creation of AIS, which impact states, has the consent of the states' representatives in the Upper House.  This is a significant check on the central government's power.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts.  They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies and legislation that promote social and economic welfare.  While courts cannot compel the state to implement DPSPs, they can influence policy indirectly by interpreting laws and government actions in light of the principles enshrined in DPSPs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles are meant to provide a socio-economic framework for the Indian nation. They aim to create a welfare state that addresses social and economic inequalities and promotes justice, equality, and liberty for all citizens.  The DPSPs cover a wide range of issues, including education, healthcare, work opportunities, and social security, reflecting a vision of a society that is both just and equitable.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression without any limitations.
2.  The Constitution establishes a parliamentary system of government where the executive is responsible to the legislature.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression (Article 19(1)(a)), this right is not absolute.  Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of public order, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence.  The courts have consistently upheld the validity of such restrictions, balancing the fundamental right with other societal interests.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a parliamentary system of government, a key feature of which is the executive's accountability to the legislature. The Council of Ministers, which forms the executive branch, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (Lower House). This means that the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power.  A vote of no confidence can be used to remove the government if it loses the support of the Lok Sabha. This mechanism ensures the executive's responsiveness to the legislature and the will of the people.


**6. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2.  The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India. The appointment is usually made on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This structure reflects the unitary nature of certain aspects of the Indian federal system, where the central government plays a role in appointing key officials in the states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor possesses certain powers regarding the State Legislative Assembly, they cannot dissolve it at will. The Governor typically dissolves the Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister of the State.  The Governor's power to dissolve the Assembly is subject to constitutional constraints and the advice of the Chief Minister.  The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature, and in certain exceptional circumstances, they may act on the advice of the Central government.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a fixed term.
2.  The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is appointed by the President of India for a six-year term or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The CAG holds a position of high constitutional authority and independence, responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments. Their independence is crucial for ensuring financial accountability and transparency in the functioning of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG's audit responsibilities extend to both the Union and the State Governments.  The CAG audits the accounts of all government departments, ministries, public sector undertakings, and other bodies receiving government funds.  This broad mandate ensures that public funds are utilized efficiently and transparently at both the central and state levels, promoting financial accountability and good governance.  The CAG submits audit reports to the Parliament and the State Legislatures, playing a vital role in parliamentary oversight.


**8. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a single-member body.  While originally a single-member body, it was later amended to have a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners. The presence of multiple commissioners ensures a more robust and comprehensive approach to election management.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.  This includes deciding the election schedule for both general elections and by-elections.  The ECI's independence and impartiality are crucial for upholding the democratic process and ensuring that elections are conducted according to the law and constitutional provisions.  The ECI's decisions regarding election schedules are binding and are crucial for the smooth conduct of elections.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the President of India:**

1. The President can declare financial emergency at any time.
2. The President can dissolve Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President of India has the power to declare a financial emergency (Article 360), they cannot do so at any time.  A financial emergency can only be declared if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or credit of India or any part of India is threatened.  The declaration requires a formal assessment of the situation, and it is not an arbitrary power vested in the President.  A financial emergency, once declared, requires parliamentary approval to remain in effect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament. However, this power is not exercised independently. The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister.  This constitutional provision reflects the parliamentary system of government in India, where the executive branch (led by the Prime Minister) exercises significant power, while the President serves as the head of state.


**10. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  Panchayats are given the power to levy and collect taxes and duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats.  This amendment mandates the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate (block or taluk), and district levels. The Act aims to decentralize power and empower local communities in rural areas.  It provides a constitutional framework for the functioning of PRIs and ensures their representation in local governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 73rd Amendment Act empowers Panchayats to levy and collect taxes, duties, tolls, and fees. This financial autonomy is crucial for their effective functioning and allows them to raise resources for local development initiatives.  The specific taxes and duties that Panchayats can levy are determined by the State Governments, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian system.  This financial empowerment enables PRIs to undertake development programs and respond to the needs of their communities.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising three members, including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutionally mandated body. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly define the number of members, it's established practice and convention that the ECI comprises three members: the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.  This structure ensures a degree of checks and balances within the commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The responsibility for deciding the election schedule rests with the Election Commission of India, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice or any other ministry.  The ECI's independence is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections, and this includes setting the election timetable free from executive interference.  The Union Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters related to elections but doesn't set the election schedule.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can only be impeached by the Parliament through a special majority vote in both Houses, based on charges of violation of the Constitution.
2. The Vice-President of India can be removed from office only by a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha, supported by a majority of its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The process of impeachment of the President of India is laid out in the Constitution and requires a two-stage process involving both Houses of Parliament.  However, the grounds for impeachment are not restricted solely to violations of the Constitution but encompass any breach of constitutional duties or misconduct.  The statement simplifies the grounds, but the core process described is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The removal of the Vice-President is also a parliamentary process but it is initiated and carried out by the Rajya Sabha alone.  A resolution is passed by a majority of members present and voting.   The Lok Sabha does not play a role in this process. The statement inaccurately claims that a simple majority is sufficient; the process requires a majority of the members present and voting in the Rajya Sabha.


**3. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The distribution of powers between the Union and the States is based on a rigid division of subjects listed in three lists (Union, State, and Concurrent) in the Seventh Schedule.
2. The Union government has the power to legislate on any subject in the State List, with the consent of the State legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indian Constitution employs a federal structure with a distribution of powers between the Union and the States. This division is primarily outlined in the Seventh Schedule, which categorizes subjects into three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.  However, the division is not entirely rigid as there are provisions for the Union to legislate on State List subjects under certain circumstances (e.g., during a national emergency).  The statement's simplification of the system as a "rigid division" is a slight overstatement, but the core idea is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Union government can legislate on State List subjects under certain conditions, it does not require the mere consent of the State legislature.  The Constitution outlines specific circumstances under which the Union can exercise such power, such as during emergencies or when a matter of national importance is involved. The statement's description is oversimplified and inaccurate.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of "Judicial Review" allows the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws enacted by the legislature and actions taken by the executive.
2. The power of Judicial Review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Judicial review is a cornerstone of India's constitutional framework.  It empowers the judiciary to review laws passed by the Parliament and actions undertaken by the executive to determine their conformity with the Constitution. This power ensures that the actions of other branches of government remain within the constitutional limits.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the power of judicial review is a fundamental aspect of India's constitutional system, it's not explicitly mentioned as a separate, enumerated power within the text of the Constitution.  It has evolved as a fundamental principle through judicial precedents and interpretations of the Constitution, primarily based on the principles of basic structure and the supremacy of the Constitution.


**5. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a Money Bill.
2.  A Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha can be rejected by the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate a Money Bill. This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha on a Money Bill, but it cannot initiate or amend its core financial provisions.  This reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected lower house.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can consider a Money Bill and suggest amendments, it cannot reject it outright.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on a Money Bill; if the Rajya Sabha fails to return the Bill within 14 days (or a longer period determined by the Lok Sabha), the Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to scrutiny and recommendation, not outright rejection.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India, and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor of a State can exercise his/her executive power either directly or through officers subordinate to him/her.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India.  The appointment is a significant aspect of the relationship between the Union and the States in the Indian federal system.  Crucially, the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss the Governor at any time. This reflects the ultimate authority of the Union government.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Governor of a State is the constitutional head of the State executive, the Governor can exercise the executive power either directly or through officers subordinate to him/her. This is a standard feature of executive functioning.


**7. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country, and its decisions are binding on all other courts.
2.  The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Government of India and one or more States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country, and its decisions are binding on all other courts within the Indian judicial system.  This ensures uniformity and consistency in judicial interpretations across the country.  This is a fundamental aspect of the single integrated judicial system in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends to certain specific types of cases, including disputes between the Union government and one or more states. This power is crucial for resolving inter-governmental disputes and upholding the balance of power within the federal structure.


**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts of law.
2. The Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts. While they represent the state's commitment to social and economic justice, they are aspirational goals that serve as guidelines for the government's policies.  Their non-justiciable nature reflects the balance between individual rights and socio-economic goals within the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.  These rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and protect individual freedoms and liberties against state encroachment.  The courts can issue writs and other orders to uphold these rights.  The statement misrepresents the nature of Fundamental Rights.


**9. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
2. The President of India is a member of both the Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Union. This is a significant aspect of the President's role as the head of state.  The Supreme Commander role underscores the President's position as the ultimate authority over the country's defense forces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India is not a member of either House of Parliament. While the President is an integral part of the legislative process (e.g., giving assent to bills), the President does not participate as a member of the legislative body.  The statement misrepresents the President's constitutional role.


**10. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The President can dismiss the Prime Minister at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In India's parliamentary system, the President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha. The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means that the government can be removed from power through a vote of no confidence in the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President has certain powers related to the appointment and dismissal of the Council of Ministers, the President cannot dismiss the Prime Minister arbitrarily. The President is bound by constitutional conventions and the need to maintain the stability of the government.  The President would typically act on the advice of the Prime Minister, except in extraordinary circumstances where the government's legitimacy is severely questioned.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers at the Centre is collectively responsible to the Parliament,  and individual ministers are accountable to the President.
2. The President appoints Union Ministers based solely on the Prime Minister's advice, and these ministers hold office at the President's pleasure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). While individual ministers are responsible to the Parliament, the statement implying direct accountability to the President is inaccurate. The President's role is largely ceremonial in this regard; the real power of appointment and dismissal rests with the Prime Minister, who enjoys the confidence of the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the President appoints Union Ministers,  this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The ministers hold office as long as the Council of Ministers, as a whole, retains the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  The President’s power is largely formal;  the Prime Minister's advice is binding. The President cannot independently dismiss a minister.


**2. With reference to the National Development Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council (NDC) is a constitutional body established under Article 263 of the Constitution.
2. The NDC's primary function is to formulate five-year plans, and its recommendations are binding on the Union and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body; it was established by a resolution of the Union government in 1952. It does not derive its authority from the Constitution itself.  Article 263 deals with the Inter-State Council, a different body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NDC plays a crucial role in formulating five-year plans, but its recommendations are not legally binding on the Union or State governments.  Its primary function is to foster coordination and cooperation between the Centre and the States on matters of national development.  The plans are ultimately implemented based on the decisions of individual governments.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are elected from among its members.
2. Nominated members of Parliament have voting rights in the election of the President but not in the election of the Vice-President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are elected from amongst its members.  This is a key aspect of the internal functioning and governance of the Upper House of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Nominated members of Parliament do not have voting rights in the election of either the President or the Vice-President.  This is because nominated members are not directly elected by the people and are not considered to represent the electorate's will in such high-stakes elections.


**4. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA's main objective is to provide free legal aid to marginalized communities and ensure equal access to justice.
2. NALSA directly implements legal programs and schemes at the state level, bypassing State Legal Services Authorities (SLAs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NALSA's primary function is to provide free and competent legal services to weaker sections of society, promoting equal opportunity to justice. This aligns with the constitutional mandate to ensure access to justice for all.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NALSA issues guidelines and provides overall direction for the implementation of legal programs and schemes. However, the actual implementation at the state level is primarily the responsibility of the State Legal Services Authorities (SLAs).  NALSA works in coordination with, and not in place of, the SLAs.


**5. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The District Collector/Deputy Commissioner is the sole authority to initiate the process of determining forest rights.
2.  Gram Sabhas have no role in the process of determining individual or community forest rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the District Collector/Deputy Commissioner plays a significant role, the Act emphasizes the crucial role of Gram Sabhas in initiating the process of determining forest rights.  The Gram Sabha's involvement is a cornerstone of the Act's approach to recognizing traditional forest rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly mandates the Gram Sabha's participation as the primary authority for identifying and recording individual or community forest rights.  The Gram Sabha's role is central to ensuring that the process is participatory and respects local knowledge and customs.


**6. With reference to "Economic Justice" in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. "Economic Justice" is explicitly mentioned as a goal in the Preamble and is further elaborated in the Fundamental Rights.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy provide the framework for achieving "Economic Justice," while the Fundamental Rights primarily focus on civil and political liberties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  "Economic Justice" is a fundamental goal of the Indian Constitution, as implied in the Preamble which aims to secure social, economic and political justice. However, the Fundamental Rights primarily address civil and political rights.  The concept of economic justice is not explicitly detailed in the Fundamental Rights themselves.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy, although not justiciable (not enforceable by courts), lay out the socio-economic goals of the state, including the pursuit of economic justice.  The Fundamental Rights, while guaranteeing various freedoms, primarily focus on civil and political rights.


**7. With reference to Money Bills in India, consider the following statements:**

1. If the Rajya Sabha amends a Money Bill substantially, the Lok Sabha can still pass the bill, accepting or rejecting the Rajya Sabha's recommendations.
2. The President has the power to call a joint sitting of both houses to resolve a deadlock on a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only make recommendations within 14 days. The Lok Sabha has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations.  The power of the Lok Sabha on Money Bills is supreme.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President does not have the power to call a joint sitting to resolve a deadlock on a Money Bill. Joint sittings are only permissible for ordinary legislation.  The supremacy of the Lok Sabha on financial matters prevents the use of a joint sitting to override the lower house’s decision.


**8. With reference to the appointment of Governors in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The same person can be appointed as Governor for two or more States simultaneously.
2. The Constitution of India lays down a specific procedure for removing a Governor from office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution allows for the appointment of the same person as Governor for two or more States. This is a practical arrangement to efficiently manage the gubernatorial responsibilities across multiple states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not lay down a specific procedure for the removal of a Governor. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This implies that the President can remove the Governor at any time without any specified process or grounds.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. A constitutional amendment can be initiated only by introducing a bill in the Lok Sabha.
2. An amendment that alters the federal character of the Constitution requires ratification by the legislatures of all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although amendments can be introduced in either house, the process typically begins in the Lok Sabha (the lower house).  While the Rajya Sabha can also consider and amend a bill, the Lok Sabha retains the primary power in initiating the amendment process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some amendments may require ratification by state legislatures (e.g., those affecting the federal structure), it does not necessitate ratification by *all* state legislatures. The Constitution specifies different ratification requirements for different types of amendments.


**10. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General can participate in parliamentary proceedings but cannot vote.
2. The Attorney General can be a member of a parliamentary committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, offering legal advice and opinions. However, the Attorney General does not have voting rights in Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Attorney General can be consulted by parliamentary committees, they cannot be a member of a parliamentary committee.  Their role is primarily advisory to the government, not a direct participant in the legislative process.


**11. With reference to bodies not mentioned in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is a statutory body established by an act of Parliament.
2. The Planning Commission was a non-constitutional body established by a resolution of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a statutory body; it was established by a resolution of the government.  It does not have a constitutional basis.

Statement 2 is correct. The Planning Commission was a non-constitutional body, established by a resolution of the government in 1950.  Its functions were significant but it did not derive its authority from the Constitution.  It was later replaced by NITI Aayog.


**12. With reference to the implementation of international treaties in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament needs the consent of all states to legislate on matters covered by international treaties.
2. Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India to implement international treaties without the consent of any state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Parliament does not require the consent of all states to implement international treaties.  The Union government has the power to enter into international agreements, and Parliament has the authority to enact laws necessary for their implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The power of Parliament to legislate on any subject for the whole or any part of India extends to implementing international treaties.  This is a crucial aspect of India's sovereignty and its ability to fulfil international obligations.


**13. With reference to the objectives of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. A primary objective of PESA is to create autonomous regions within tribal areas.
2. PESA aims to empower Gram Sabhas to manage and protect traditional forest rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PESA aims to enhance self-governance in Scheduled Areas, it does not explicitly aim to create autonomous regions. The Act focuses on empowering existing local governance structures, primarily Gram Sabhas.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of PESA is to empower Gram Sabhas to participate in the management and protection of traditional forest resources and rights within their areas.  This reflects a focus on participatory governance and the recognition of traditional rights within tribal communities.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding "Classical Languages" declared by the Government of India:**

1. Gujarati and Kannada are among the languages declared as "Classical Languages."
2. Telugu is not among the languages declared as a "Classical Language."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both Gujarati and Kannada have been declared as "Classical Languages" by the Government of India, reflecting their rich historical and literary heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Telugu is also among the languages declared as a "Classical Language" by the Government of India.  The declaration recognizes the significant contribution of Telugu literature and culture.


**15. With reference to the largest Committees of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Public Accounts is the largest committee of the Parliament.
2. The Committee on Estimates is larger than the Committee on Public Undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Committee on Estimates is generally considered the largest committee of the Parliament in terms of membership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the exact sizes may vary slightly depending on the Parliament's composition, the Committee on Public Accounts is typically larger than the Committee on Public Undertakings. The relative sizes of these committees are not fixed and can change.


**16. With reference to sales tax on goods, consider the following statements:**

1. Sales tax on toothpaste is imposed by the Central Government and collected by the State Government.
2. Sales tax is primarily a State subject under the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sales tax on goods is primarily a State subject (under the State List). While the Central Government may levy some indirect taxes that affect sales, the primary imposition and collection of sales tax rest with the State Governments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution of India places sales tax primarily within the purview of State Governments. This is a crucial aspect of the federal distribution of powers in India’s tax system.


**17. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements regarding anti-defection:**

1. Provisions related to anti-defection are found in the Fifth Schedule.
2. The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution deals with disqualification of members on grounds of defection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.  Anti-defection provisions are not included in this schedule.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, also known as the Anti-Defection Law, lays down the grounds for disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on account of defection.


**18. With reference to the promotion of international peace and security in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble to the Constitution explicitly mentions the promotion of international peace and security.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to secure justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, it does not explicitly mention the promotion of international peace and security.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy include provisions that encourage the promotion of international peace and security as part of India's broader foreign policy goals.  This reflects India's commitment to global cooperation and peaceful relations.


**19. With reference to ‘Planning’ in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is directly involved in the process of formulating five-year plans.
2. The National Development Council plays a significant role in the planning process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission’s role is primarily related to the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments. It is not directly involved in formulating five-year plans.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Development Council (NDC) plays a central role in the planning process in India.  It serves as a forum for coordination and discussion between the Union and State governments on matters of national development and plan formulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a Constitutional Government prioritizes individual liberty, it does not do so at the complete expense of state authority. A balance is necessary for effective governance and social order.  Restrictions are placed on both individual actions and state power.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core principle of a Constitutional Government is to establish a balance between individual liberty and state authority.  This involves defining the limits of both, ensuring neither dominates the other to the detriment of society.


**22. With reference to the discretionary powers of a State Governor, consider the following statements:**

1. Appointing Ministers is a discretionary power of the Governor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers and plays a central role in executive decision-making, all executive actions are taken in the name of the President, not the Prime Minister. This reflects the constitutional position of the President as the head of state.


**24. With reference to a No-Confidence Motion in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly mentions the procedure for a No-Confidence Motion.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States and between two or more States.  This is a vital aspect of its role in maintaining federal balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends beyond disputes between private individuals.  It includes matters of significant constitutional importance, such as disputes between the Union and States and between different States.


**26. With reference to the increase in the number of Supreme Court Judges, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India has the sole power to increase the number of Supreme Court Judges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy aim to establish a welfare state and achieve socio-economic justice.  These principles guide the state in formulating policies towards social and economic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles are not justiciable; they are not enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the government in policy-making, rather than legally binding obligations.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only offer suggestions or recommendations within a specified time frame.  The Lok Sabha has the final authority on Money Bills.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on Demands for Grants; this is the exclusive right of the Lok Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government expenditure.


**29. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. The Act established diarchy in the provinces.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A joint sitting requires a simple majority of members present and voting for the passage of a bill, not a three-fourths majority.  This is a crucial difference from the voting requirements for constitutional amendments.

Statement 2 is correct. A joint sitting of both houses of Parliament is convened to resolve a deadlock on an ordinary bill, where the two houses have failed to reach an agreement.  This is a constitutional mechanism for resolving legislative disputes.


**31. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Finance Commission.

Statement 2 is correct. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015.  The shift aimed to create a more cooperative and collaborative federal framework for planning and development.


**32. Consider the following statements:**

1. The executive power of the Union of India is vested in the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President.  However, this power is exercised by the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, reflecting the parliamentary system of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chairman of the Civil Services Board is the Prime Minister, but this is not an ex-officio position explicitly defined in the Constitution. The Prime Minister chairs the board by convention.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in certain States.  It outlines the framework for governance in these areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides a special arrangement for the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils to manage local affairs.


**34. With reference to the Union Government's financial procedures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue prepares the Union Budget.
2.  Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 2 is correct.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  This is a fundamental aspect of parliamentary control over public finances.


**35. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is the custodian of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India interprets the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Odia has been declared a classical language by the Government of India, recognizing its rich literary and historical heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While several languages have received classical language status, Assamese is not one of them that has been recently declared a classical language.  The criteria for such declaration are stringent and based on a language's antiquity and significant literary tradition.


**37. Consider the following statements regarding the Legislative Council of a State in India:**

1. The Legislative Council can be larger in size than the Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Legislative Council cannot be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly of the state.  The size of the Legislative Council is subject to constitutional limitations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council from amongst its members. This is a constitutional provision that reflects the Governor's role in the State Legislature.


**38. With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2. This provision is enshrined in the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble emphasizes the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India, this specific phrase is not explicitly present in the Preamble.

Statement 2 is correct. The Fundamental Duties, added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment, explicitly include the duty of every citizen to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.


**39. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary objective is financial mobilization.
2.  The system aims to achieve democratic decentralization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While financial mobilization is an important aspect of Panchayati Raj, it is not the primary objective. The system's main goal is to empower local communities and enhance their participation in governance and development.

Statement 2 is correct.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile status within India.
2.  Once assigned, an Aadhaar number remains permanently active and cannot be deactivated or removed by the issuing authority under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Aadhaar card is widely used as proof of identity and address, it does not, in itself, constitute legal proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined by the Citizenship Act, and domicile is determined by state-specific laws.  Aadhaar simply verifies an individual's identity and address based on the information provided during enrollment.  It's a crucial document for various purposes but doesn't replace official citizenship or domicile documentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the body responsible for Aadhaar, can deactivate or update Aadhaar numbers under specific circumstances, such as detection of fraudulent activity, discrepancies in information, or at the request of the individual.  Therefore, the claim of permanent immutability is false.  The UIDAI has mechanisms in place for managing and correcting errors or irregularities in the Aadhaar database.  The system is designed to be dynamic and adaptable to changes in an individual's circumstances.


**2. With reference to the Right to Privacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly guaranteed as a fundamental right under a specific article of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has interpreted the Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21) to include the Right to Privacy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly mention a standalone "Right to Privacy" in a dedicated article.  While several articles touch upon aspects of privacy, there isn't one single, comprehensive article defining it.

Statement 2 is correct. In the landmark *Puttaswamy* case (2017), the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Right to Privacy is an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court recognized privacy as a fundamental right crucial for human dignity and autonomy.  This interpretation significantly broadened the scope of Article 21 and established the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right despite its absence as a separate, explicitly mentioned right.


**3. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Each Member of Parliament (MP) carries an equal weighted vote regardless of their house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).
2.  The electoral value of a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) vote differs across states, reflecting variations in state population sizes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electoral value of an MP's vote is not equal between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The value is calculated differently for each house, resulting in a higher weighted vote for Lok Sabha MPs due to their larger representation.  The system ensures proportional representation of both houses in the presidential election.

Statement 2 is correct. The value of an MLA's vote varies from state to state because it's calculated based on the state's population. States with larger populations have a higher ratio of population to MLA, leading to a lower value for each MLA's vote compared to states with smaller populations. This formula ensures that states with larger populations have a proportionately greater influence in the presidential election while maintaining the principle of one person, one vote.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Governor of a State:**

1.  The Governor of a State enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution during their tenure in office.
2.  The Governor's emoluments and allowances remain unchanged throughout their term of office and cannot be reduced.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor enjoys significant protection from legal action, it's not absolute immunity.  The Governor can be prosecuted for actions committed before assuming office or for actions unrelated to their official duties after their term ends.  There are established legal processes for addressing any alleged wrongdoing, even during their term.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution explicitly provides that the emoluments and allowances of the Governor cannot be diminished during their term. This provision is designed to ensure the Governor's financial independence and impartiality in carrying out their duties. Any attempts to reduce their remuneration would need to wait until the end of their term. This protection is a key aspect of their constitutional role.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill can only be introduced by a Member of Parliament (MP) who has been directly elected by the people and not nominated.
2. The President of India has the power to introduce a bill in either house of Parliament even if it is not a money bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While most private member's bills are introduced by directly elected MPs, the definition of a "private member" doesn't explicitly exclude nominated MPs. A nominated MP can introduce a bill, though they are less likely to do so due to their smaller numbers and often different political priorities.  The focus is on whether the bill is introduced by a member of the government or not.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President, while not a member of either house, can introduce a bill. This is a unique power of the President, usually exercised in consultation with the government on matters of national importance.  The power is not restricted to money bills.  The President's role in this aspect is largely ceremonial, with the government drafting and driving the legislative process.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the features of Indian Federalism:**

1.  The Indian federal structure is characterized by a clear and equal distribution of powers between the Union and the States, with each having clearly defined jurisdictions.
2.  The Indian judiciary plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power between the Union and the States, acting as an independent arbiter of constitutional disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indian Constitution does demarcate powers between the Union and States (through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List), the distribution isn't perfectly equal. The Union government holds significant power, particularly in areas of national security and economic policy.  Furthermore, the Union List has a broader scope than the State List.  The federal structure leans towards a quasi-federal model, with a stronger central government compared to a strictly symmetrical federal system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has played, and continues to play, a pivotal role in arbitrating disputes between the Union and the States.  Its power of judicial review allows it to interpret the Constitution and determine the limits of each level's authority, upholding the principles of federalism and maintaining a balance of power. This independent role of the judiciary is a critical safeguard of the federal structure.


**7. With reference to the President's Rule in a State (Article 356), consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2.  The proclamation of President's Rule invariably results in the removal of the State Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the proclamation of President's Rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not automatic. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, particularly if there's a possibility of restoring constitutional governance without a fresh election.  The decision depends on the specific circumstances leading to the imposition of President's Rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The proclamation of President’s Rule usually leads to the removal of the State Council of Ministers.  The State government loses its authority, and the administration is taken over by the Union government.  The Council of Ministers is inherently connected to the State government's functioning, and their removal is a necessary step in the process of assuming control under Article 356.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers:**

1.  The Parliament can remove the entire Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.
2.  The Parliament exercises control over the Council of Ministers primarily through the question hour and debates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A no-confidence motion, if passed by the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament), forces the entire Council of Ministers to resign.  This is a crucial mechanism for holding the executive accountable to the legislature.  The Rajya Sabha (upper house) cannot move a no-confidence motion.

Statement 2 is correct.  The question hour and debates are essential tools for parliamentary oversight of the Council of Ministers.  MPs can question ministers on government policies and actions, and debates allow for scrutiny and discussion of various aspects of governance.  These mechanisms facilitate transparency and accountability, enabling Parliament to keep the executive in check.  Supplementary questions and adjournment motions also contribute to this control.


**9. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review concerning their constitutionality.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has upheld the absolute immunity of all laws placed in the Ninth Schedule from judicial scrutiny.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While initially laws placed in the Ninth Schedule were largely shielded from judicial review, the Supreme Court has since clarified that this immunity isn't absolute.  The Court has ruled that laws added to the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review if they violate fundamental rights.  The Court's interpretation has limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protective effect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has not upheld absolute immunity for all laws in the Ninth Schedule.  The Court's position evolved over time, recognizing that granting complete immunity to laws irrespective of their content would undermine the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.  The Court's rulings have prioritized the protection of fundamental rights, thereby restricting the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Education (RTE) Act:**

1. The RTE Act mandates that all children aged 6-14 years have the right to free and compulsory education in a recognized school.
2. The RTE Act specifies the minimum qualifications for teachers in primary schools, but these qualifications may vary among states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RTE Act guarantees free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14 years.  This right is a fundamental right and is enforceable through legal mechanisms.  The Act aims to ensure that all children have access to quality education irrespective of their socioeconomic background.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RTE Act does set minimum qualifications for teachers in primary schools, including the requirement to pass a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET). However, the Act allows states to set additional qualifications or requirements based on their specific needs and circumstances.  This flexibility acknowledges that varying state contexts might require different levels of expertise or training.


**11. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is solely accountable to the Parliament of India.
2. The CAG has the power to audit the accounts of all government bodies, including autonomous and statutory bodies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is an independent constitutional authority, directly accountable to the Parliament.  This independence is crucial for ensuring the impartiality and objectivity of audits.  The CAG submits its reports directly to the Parliament, which then scrutinizes public finances through the Public Accounts Committee.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's audit mandate extends to all government bodies, including those that are autonomous or statutory.  This wide-ranging authority is intended to ensure that all public funds are accounted for and utilized efficiently and effectively. This includes a wide range of organizations that receive government funds or operate under government oversight.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to Parliament by the Minister of Finance.
2.  No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the prior authorization of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, a comprehensive financial statement of the government's revenue and expenditure, is presented annually to the Parliament by the Minister of Finance.  This presentation initiates the legislative process for approving the budget.  The Budget lays out the government's financial plans for the coming fiscal year.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the express authorization of Parliament. This ensures that the government's spending is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval, upholding the principle of parliamentary control over public finances.  This prevents the executive from spending public money without legislative sanction.


**13. With reference to the local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments provide a constitutional basis for local self-governance in rural and urban areas, respectively.
2.  The establishment of local self-government bodies is solely the responsibility of the respective state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment (1992) deals with Panchayats (rural local bodies), while the 74th Amendment (1992) deals with Municipalities (urban local bodies). These amendments provide a constitutional framework and mandate for the establishment and functioning of these bodies, thereby guaranteeing their existence and role in the governance structure.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Constitution provides the framework, the actual establishment and operation of local self-government bodies are primarily the responsibility of the state governments.  States are given significant autonomy in designing and implementing their local governance systems, tailoring them to local needs and circumstances, although the constitutional amendments set minimum standards.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Lok Sabha Speaker:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker holds office during the pleasure of the President of India.
2.  The Lok Sabha Speaker can cast a deciding vote in case of a tie.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha Speaker is not appointed by or accountable to the President. The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha itself. While the President has certain constitutional powers, they do not extend to the removal or appointment of the Speaker.  The Speaker’s position is secured within the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha Speaker has a casting vote in case of a tie during a vote in the House.  This power is crucial in ensuring that the House can always reach a decision, even when votes are equally divided.  The casting vote is a key part of the Speaker's authority in managing House proceedings.


**15. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union Government and one or more states.
2.  The Supreme Court can hear appeals against the decisions of the High Courts on matters related to fundamental rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Union Government and one or more states.  This jurisdiction emphasizes the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of inter-governmental disputes.  These cases often involve significant constitutional issues.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over High Court decisions, particularly those involving fundamental rights.  This ensures that individuals can seek redress from the highest court in the country if their fundamental rights have been violated by a High Court decision.  This appellate power is a crucial safeguard of fundamental rights.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are enforceable by the courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not justiciable.  They are not directly enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards a just and equitable society.  They represent the government's aspirational goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, promoting social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens.  They guide government policies and programs towards achieving these objectives.  The principles reflect the Constitution's commitment to a just and equitable society.


**17. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament.
2. The NGT has the power to hear cases related to environmental pollution and degradation only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established through an Act of Parliament, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  This Act provides the legal basis for the NGT's functioning and jurisdiction.  The Act establishes the Tribunal as a specialized body to deal with environmental issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NGT primarily deals with environmental issues, its jurisdiction is not limited to pollution and degradation. It can also address a wider range of environmental matters, including those related to the conservation of natural resources, environmental clearances, and other environmental laws. The Tribunal's scope is broad, encompassing various aspects of environmental protection.



**18. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body.
2. The UPSC's recommendations on appointments are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is a constitutional body, established under Article 315 of the Indian Constitution.  Its establishment is mandated by the Constitution, reflecting its importance in the recruitment and appointment of civil servants.  The body is responsible for ensuring a merit-based selection process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UPSC plays a crucial role in recommending candidates for various government positions, its recommendations are not binding on the government. The government can accept, reject, or modify the UPSC's recommendations.  The government retains the final authority in appointment decisions, but the UPSC's role is to ensure a fair and transparent selection process based on merit.


**19. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates that one-third of the seats in PRIs should be reserved for women.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates that the chairperson of the Zila Parishad should be elected indirectly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates that at least one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats at all levels should be reserved for women.  This reservation is a crucial step towards ensuring women's participation in local governance.  The provision aims to address gender inequality and promote inclusive representation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment does not specify how the chairperson of the Zila Parishad should be elected.  The method of election (direct or indirect) is left to the state governments to decide based on their specific circumstances and preferences.  While some states may choose indirect election, it's not a constitutional mandate.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate money bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a money bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate money bills.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce money bills.  This is a key aspect of the Lok Sabha's greater power over financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and making recommendations on money bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a money bill.  It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's final decision on a money bill is paramount.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary responsibility for financial legislation.




**1. With reference to the President of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can only be removed from office through impeachment by Parliament, based on violation of the Constitution.
2.  The President's salary and allowances can be altered during their term of office, provided it's done through a parliamentary process.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution outlines a specific impeachment process for removing the President, initiated by either House of Parliament and requiring a two-thirds majority in both Houses. The grounds for impeachment are broadly defined as "violation of the Constitution," although the exact interpretation remains open to debate.  This process emphasizes the gravity of removing the head of state and ensures a high threshold for such an action.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Parliament determines the President's emoluments and allowances, the Constitution explicitly states that these cannot be diminished during their term of office. This protection is designed to ensure the President's financial independence and prevent political interference.  Any changes would need to be implemented *after* the President's term concludes or be beneficial to the incumbent.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to initiate and pass Money Bills, subject to the Lok Sabha's concurrence.
2. The Rajya Sabha's members are elected indirectly through the state legislative assemblies, with each state receiving unequal representation based on its population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate Money Bills; this power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha. While the Rajya Sabha can consider and make recommendations on Money Bills, the Lok Sabha has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and scrutinize, not to originate financial legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's members are elected indirectly by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies. The unequal representation of states in the Rajya Sabha reflects a compromise between the principles of population representation and federalism, giving smaller states a proportionally larger voice in the upper house compared to their representation in the Lok Sabha.


**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, combining elements of both federal and unitary governance.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is based primarily on the Government of India Act, 1935.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian federal system is often described as "quasi-federal" or "cooperative federalism" due to its unique blend of federal and unitary features. While there's a division of powers between the Centre and the States, the Centre holds significant power, particularly in areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency.  The existence of All-India Services and the power of the Centre to intervene in state matters during emergencies further underscore this mixed nature.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading.  While the Government of India Act, 1935, provided a framework for the distribution of powers, the Indian Constitution established a significantly different and more nuanced system.  The 1935 Act's framework was largely discarded, though some aspects influenced the initial structure.  The Indian Constitution's scheme of federalism is unique and distinct from its predecessor.


**4. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anti-Defection Law primarily aims to prevent individual members from changing their party affiliation for personal gain.
2.  The presiding officer of the legislature (Speaker or Chairman) has the final authority in deciding defection cases, and their decision is not judicially reviewable.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The primary objective of the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law) is to curb floor-crossing by individual legislators.  While it addresses en-masse defections, its focus is primarily on preventing individual members from switching parties for personal advantages or political opportunism. This helps to maintain the stability of governments and prevent political instability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the presiding officer initially decides defection cases, their decision is subject to judicial review in certain circumstances.  Courts have intervened in some cases to overturn decisions deemed arbitrary or biased, demonstrating that the presiding officer’s power isn't absolute. The scope of judicial review is a matter of ongoing debate and legal interpretation.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Indian Constitution incorporates elements borrowed from various other constitutions, including the Government of Ireland Act, 1935.
2. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts of law like Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is a composite document, drawing inspiration from various sources. The Directive Principles of State Policy, for example, were inspired by the Irish Constitution.  Other influences include the Government of India Act, 1935 (for its federal structure, though significantly modified), the US Constitution (for features like judicial review), and the British Constitution (for parliamentary traditions).


Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy is that the former are justiciable (enforceable in courts), while the latter are not directly enforceable.  While they guide state policy and are considered important for social and economic justice, courts cannot directly compel the state to implement them.  They serve as aspirational goals for the government.


**6. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually to Parliament by the Department of Revenue.
2. The Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawing funds from both the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in tax administration and revenue collection, the Union Budget is presented to Parliament by the Department of Expenditure (under the Ministry of Finance). This department is responsible for the overall budget preparation and presentation process, encompassing both revenue and expenditure aspects.


Statement 2 is correct.  Parliamentary authorization is essential for the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, which holds the government's revenue receipts.  However, it’s important to note that while the Public Account also holds government funds, these are primarily for specific purposes (like small savings or contingency funds) and don't require the same level of direct parliamentary authorization for every disbursement.  The distinction lies in the nature and purpose of the funds.



**7. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to dismiss the Council of Ministers if they lose the confidence of the Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governor of a state, and the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This means the President can remove the Governor at any time, although such action is rare and usually only taken in exceptional circumstances.  This provision reflects the Centre's ultimate authority over state governments, ensuring a balance within the federal structure.


Statement 2 is also correct.  While the Governor formally appoints the Chief Minister and other ministers, they must command the confidence of the Legislative Assembly. If the Council of Ministers loses this confidence (as demonstrated through a no-confidence motion or other factors), the Governor is constitutionally bound to dismiss them. This ensures the government's accountability to the state legislature.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President's office, but not for local body elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Election Commission of India (ECI) can have additional Election Commissioners, it is headed by a single Chief Election Commissioner (CEC). The CEC is the ultimate authority within the ECI.  The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the President based on the needs of the situation.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECI's mandate encompasses the conduct of elections at all levels – Parliament, State Legislatures, President, and Vice-President.  While the specific procedures might vary slightly, the ECI plays a crucial role in ensuring free and fair elections across the country at all levels of government. The ECI also plays a major role in the delimitation of constituencies.


**9. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years, or until the age of 65.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, but not the accounts of government-owned public sector undertakings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, but not entirely precise. The CAG is appointed by the President and holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. The slight inaccuracy does not change the core truth of the statement.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend to the accounts of all government departments, including those of government-owned public sector undertakings (PSUs).  This crucial audit function ensures transparency and accountability in the financial management of these entities.  The CAG's reports are presented to Parliament and play an important role in parliamentary oversight.


**10. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
2.  The Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32) guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights, while guaranteed by the Constitution, are not absolute.  Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  The extent of permissible restrictions is subject to judicial interpretation and varies depending on the specific right involved.  The balance between individual rights and societal interests is a central theme in constitutional law.


Statement 2 is correct. Article 32, the "heart and soul" of the Constitution according to Dr. Ambedkar, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights.  This right is itself a fundamental right, ensuring effective access to justice for citizens whose fundamental rights are violated.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is crucial in upholding these rights.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts of law.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by outlining social and economic goals for the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not directly enforceable by the courts. Unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not justiciable.  This does not mean they are unimportant; rather, they serve as guidelines for the government to work towards social and economic justice. The courts can, however, indirectly influence the implementation of these principles by interpreting other laws related to them.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The Directive Principles are designed to build a welfare state by guiding the state towards achieving social and economic objectives, such as providing social security, promoting education, and ensuring equal pay for equal work. These principles represent the socio-economic vision of the Constitution's framers.


**12. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lok Sabha alone has the power to vote on the Demands for Grants included in the Union Budget.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Lok Sabha, being the lower house and representing the people directly, has the sole power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  While the Rajya Sabha can discuss and suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha's approval is final in matters of financial legislation. This reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected house.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's supremacy in financial matters is a key aspect of the parliamentary system, reflecting the principle of popular sovereignty. The Rajya Sabha can only delay a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days.


**13.  With reference to the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the National Development Council.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, typically the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The Prime Minister holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss them if they lose the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  However, this is a largely formal power; a Prime Minister who loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha is practically forced to resign.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the National Development Council (NDC), a body that plays a crucial role in coordinating economic development across the country.  The NDC's composition includes the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and other important officials, making it a forum for Centre-State cooperation on development planning.  The NDC is not a constitutional body, however.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the judicial system in India:**

1.  The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and the States.
2.  The High Courts in India are established by the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India, under Article 131 of the Constitution, has original jurisdiction to hear disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States. This jurisdiction is crucial for resolving inter-state disputes and maintaining federal harmony.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Parliament has the power to make laws regarding the High Courts, the High Courts themselves are established under the Constitution. The Constitution provides for the establishment of a High Court for each state (Article 214), and the Parliament can create additional High Courts through legislation. The High Courts are not created by Parliament directly, but through legislation by Parliament.



**15. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in PRIs.
2.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act guarantees the financial autonomy of PRIs by mandating that they have exclusive power over taxation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) provided for the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and mandated reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and women in PRIs. This reservation is aimed at ensuring inclusive representation and addressing historical social inequalities.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act aims to strengthen the financial position of PRIs, it does not mandate exclusive power over taxation.  PRIs have the power to levy taxes and collect fees, but this power is often shared with other levels of government.  The extent of their financial autonomy varies from state to state, depending on the specific laws enacted by each state legislature.  The state finance commission also plays an important role in the distribution of funds to PRIs.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and up to two other Election Commissioners (ECs), appointed by the President of India.  The number of ECs can vary, but there is always one CEC. This ensures a collegial decision-making process and prevents undue influence by a single individual.  The structure is designed to maintain independence and impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India itself, not the Ministry of Law and Justice,  decides the election schedule. The ECI's independence is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.  While the government facilitates the process, the ECI retains the ultimate authority over the timing and conduct of elections.  The Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters, while the Election Commission is specifically responsible for electoral administration.  This division of responsibility is fundamental to the independence of the electoral process.


**2. Consider the following statements about the President's rule in a State:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule in a state automatically leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly.
2. The President's rule necessitates the removal of the state council of ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the assembly in place, particularly if there’s a belief that the situation can be rectified without dissolving the legislature. The decision depends on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation by the central government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President's rule does necessitate the suspension of the state council of ministers’ powers, but not their removal.  The council of ministers is essentially rendered inoperative. They can no longer make decisions or exercise their executive authority. However, they are not necessarily removed from office; their functions are suspended, and the Governor assumes the role of administering the state under the guidance of the central government.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature with equal representation of states in both houses.
2. The Indian federal structure is characterized by a strong central government with significant powers over the states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian legislature is bicameral, comprising the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). However, states do not have equal representation in both houses. The Lok Sabha's representation is based on population, while the Rajya Sabha's representation is not equal for all states.  Smaller states have fewer representatives than larger states in the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct. Indian federalism leans towards a strong central government.  While states have significant autonomy in certain areas, the Union government holds considerable power, particularly in matters of national importance, finance, defence, and foreign policy. This centralized tendency is a characteristic feature of Indian federalism, often described as a "quasi-federal" system. The Union government’s extensive powers and the flexibility afforded to it through various constitutional provisions, like Article 356, highlight this aspect.


**4. With reference to the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can remove the Council of Ministers through a vote of no confidence.
2. The Parliament's power to scrutinize government expenditure is primarily exercised through the Public Accounts Committee.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament, specifically the Lok Sabha, exercises a powerful check on the Council of Ministers through the vote of no confidence.  If a motion of no confidence against the government is passed in the Lok Sabha, it results in the government's resignation. This mechanism ensures that the executive remains accountable to the legislature, a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament plays a crucial role in scrutinizing government expenditure. The PAC examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which audits government accounts. By reviewing the CAG's findings, the PAC identifies instances of financial mismanagement, irregularities, or lack of efficiency. This scrutiny helps ensure financial accountability and transparency in government operations.  The PAC's recommendations are crucial for improving government efficiency and preventing misuse of public funds.


**5. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill is one introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the Council of Ministers.
2.  Private member's bills are rarely passed in the Indian Parliament due to limited time allocation and the dominance of government business.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is defined as a bill introduced by a Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a minister in the government.  This distinguishes them from government bills, which are introduced by ministers.  Private member's bills allow individual MPs to raise issues and propose legislation independently of the government's agenda.

Statement 2 is correct.  Private member's bills face significant challenges in being passed. The Parliament's agenda is largely dominated by government business, leaving little time for private member's bills.  Moreover, the ruling party's majority often makes it difficult for private member's bills to gain traction and secure passage. Although theoretically possible, the passage of a private member's bill remains a rare occurrence in the Indian Parliament.


**6. With reference to the parliamentary form of government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive is responsible to the legislature.
2. The head of state is also the head of government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A defining feature of the parliamentary system is the executive's accountability to the legislature. In India, the Council of Ministers (the executive) is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). This means the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power; a vote of no confidence can lead to its downfall.  This arrangement ensures that the executive branch remains answerable to the elected representatives of the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In India's parliamentary system, there is a clear distinction between the head of state (the President) and the head of government (the Prime Minister). The President is the ceremonial head, while the Prime Minister is the actual head of the government, wielding executive power. This separation of powers is a key element of India's democratic structure.


**7. With reference to the Cabinet form of government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet form of government ensures a swift and decisive decision-making process.
2. Collective responsibility is a key principle of the Cabinet form of government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Cabinet system can sometimes lead to delays due to the need for consensus, it also facilitates more efficient decision-making compared to other forms of government.  The collective nature of decision-making within the Cabinet allows for diverse perspectives and expertise to be considered before a policy is implemented.  The system aims to balance speed with thorough consideration of various factors.

Statement 2 is correct. Collective responsibility is a crucial principle of the Cabinet form of government.  It implies that all Cabinet ministers are jointly responsible for government decisions.  Even if an individual minister disagrees with a particular decision, the entire Cabinet stands united in support of it.  This principle promotes unity and stability in government policy,  preventing internal conflicts from undermining the government's effectiveness. This also ensures accountability of the entire cabinet to the Parliament.


**8. With reference to Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review empowers the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive actions.
2. The judiciary in India can question the wisdom or efficacy of laws passed by the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Judicial review is a fundamental power of the Indian judiciary. It allows the courts to assess whether laws passed by the legislature or actions taken by the executive are consistent with the provisions of the Constitution. If a law or action is found to be unconstitutional, the courts can declare it null and void. This power is essential for upholding the rule of law and safeguarding fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the judiciary can review the constitutionality of laws, it cannot generally question the wisdom or policy behind them.  The courts' role is to ensure that laws comply with the Constitution, not to substitute their judgment for that of the legislature regarding the desirability or effectiveness of a particular policy.  The legislature is the elected body responsible for making laws based on its understanding of the needs and priorities of the country.


**9. With reference to the concept of equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1. Equality implies the absence of privileges based on arbitrary factors.
2. Equality necessitates the absence of all forms of competition.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Equality, as a societal ideal, implies that all individuals should have equal opportunities and rights, free from privileges granted based on arbitrary factors like birth, caste, religion, gender, or other irrelevant distinctions.  It means that everyone should be treated fairly and justly under the law.  The absence of such privileges is a key element of achieving a just and equitable society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Equality does not preclude competition.  Competition, when fair and based on merit, can be a positive force for progress and innovation.  The key is to ensure that the competition is fair, with equal opportunities for all participants, so that the outcome reflects merit rather than privilege.  The absence of competition could stifle progress and lead to stagnation.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a federal structure with a strong central government.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act 1935 established a federal structure in India, dividing powers between the central and provincial governments.  However, it is important to note that the central government was relatively more powerful than the provincial governments.  The Act represented a significant step towards the establishment of a federal system, but it was not a perfectly balanced federation. The central government retained considerable control over key areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy, granting provinces greater control over their internal affairs.   This represented a departure from the earlier system of direct central rule.  Provincial legislatures were given expanded powers, reflecting an effort to grant greater self-governance to the provinces.  However, this autonomy was not absolute; the central government retained significant powers and influence over provincial matters.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar:**

1. Aadhaar can be used as definitive proof of Indian citizenship.
2. The Aadhaar number, once issued, cannot be deactivated by the issuing authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a biometric identification system, not a citizenship document. While it can be used to verify identity, it does not, by itself, establish Indian citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes and documentation. Aadhaar can be a useful tool in verifying identity for various purposes, including government services, but it is not a substitute for official citizenship documentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar numbers are intended to be permanent, they can be deactivated under certain circumstances. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has procedures for deactivation or correction of Aadhaar data if errors are discovered or if the individual requests it.  This provision is necessary to address errors, maintain data accuracy, and handle cases of identity theft or fraud.


**12. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21.
2. The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the Puttaswamy judgment (2017), the Supreme Court of India explicitly recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, finding it to be an intrinsic part of Article 21, which guarantees the Right to Life and Personal Liberty. This landmark judgment established the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, protecting individuals from unwarranted state intrusion into their personal lives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  However, the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 21 has recognized its implicit existence within the broader right to life and personal liberty.  This highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of constitutional interpretation, allowing the courts to adapt to changing societal norms and values while remaining consistent with the fundamental principles of the Constitution.


**13. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) participate in the Presidential election.
2. The value of a vote of an MLA is the same for all states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of both houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and the state legislative assemblies.  This system ensures that the President is elected through a process that reflects both national and regional representation.  The voting system is designed to give appropriate weight to the votes from different parts of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The value of an MLA's vote is not uniform across all states.  It is calculated based on the population of each state, ensuring that states with larger populations have a greater weight in the Presidential election.  This formula ensures proportional representation and prevents states with larger populations from dominating the election.  The formula is complex and designed to balance the representation of states of different population sizes.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution during his/her term of office.
2. The Governor's emoluments and allowances cannot be reduced during his/her term.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution during his/her term of office.  This protection is intended to safeguard the independence and impartiality of the Governor's office.  It prevents the Governor from being subjected to undue political pressure or harassment through legal proceedings.  This immunity is a crucial aspect of the Governor's constitutional role.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor’s emoluments and allowances cannot be diminished during his/her term of office. This provision is designed to ensure the financial security and independence of the Governor.   It prevents the legislature from exerting undue influence on the Governor through financial means, thereby protecting the Governor's independence. This financial security is essential for the impartial discharge of the Governor's duties.


**15. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive.
2. The Committee on Government Assurances monitors the implementation of assurances given by ministers in Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation is a parliamentary committee responsible for examining whether the executive branch is properly exercising the powers to make regulations, rules, sub-rules, by-laws, etc., that have been delegated to it by the Parliament or are conferred by the Constitution.  The committee ensures that the executive remains within the bounds of its delegated authority. This oversight is crucial for maintaining checks and balances within the governmental system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances is a parliamentary committee that monitors the implementation of assurances given by ministers on the floor of the House.  The committee ensures that the government fulfills its promises to Parliament.  This oversight is essential for promoting accountability and transparency in government actions and ensuring the government acts upon its commitments.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly:**

1. The Speaker vacates his/her office if he/she ceases to be a member of the Assembly.
2. The Speaker automatically vacates his/her office upon the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly holds office only as long as he/she remains a member of the Assembly.  If the Speaker ceases to be a member (e.g., due to resignation, disqualification, or defeat in an election), he/she automatically vacates the Speaker's office. This ensures that the Speaker always maintains a legitimate connection with the Assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly brings the current session to an end, the Speaker's office is not automatically vacated.  The Speaker remains in office until a new Assembly is constituted and a new Speaker is elected.  The Speaker's position is distinct from the Assembly itself.  The continuity of the Speaker's office is important for procedural matters related to the dissolution and reconstitution of the Assembly.


**17. With reference to the application of Article 356 of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The application of Article 356 automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Assembly.
2. Under Article 356, the Parliament can make laws for the State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's rule under Article 356 does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the State Assembly.  The President can choose to dissolve the assembly or keep it in place depending on the circumstances. The decision is made based on the assessment of the situation by the central government.  The central government has the discretion to consider various factors before deciding whether to dissolve the State Assembly or not.

Statement 2 is correct. Under Article 356, when President's rule is imposed on a state, the Parliament can exercise the legislative powers of the state legislature.  This is done to ensure that governance is maintained during the period of President's rule. This provision allows the central government to maintain essential services and address the situation in the state, which is considered necessary under the circumstances.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution:**

1. The Parliament can add laws to the Ninth Schedule.
2. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to add laws to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  This power was initially intended to protect land reforms and other socio-economic legislation from judicial scrutiny.  However, the Supreme Court has subsequently limited this immunity from judicial review in several cases.  The addition of laws to the Ninth Schedule is a matter of legislative discretion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has held that even laws in the Ninth Schedule can be challenged if they violate fundamental rights or other basic constitutional principles.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the Indian constitutional system, and it cannot be completely curtailed.


**19. With reference to the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Leader of the Opposition must belong to a party that has at least 10% of the total strength of the Lok Sabha.
2. The recognition of the Leader of the Opposition is based solely on the decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha is recognized if their party has at least 10% of the total strength of the House. This threshold ensures that the Leader of the Opposition represents a significant portion of the opposition and has a substantial voice in parliamentary proceedings.  The 10% threshold is a criterion for the formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Speaker plays a crucial role, the recognition of the Leader of the Opposition is not solely based on the Speaker's decision. While the Speaker makes the final decision, there are established criteria and conventions that guide this decision, including the party's strength in the House.  The Speaker’s decision is subject to scrutiny and debate within the House.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the relationship between law and liberty:**

1.  A society with more laws necessarily has less liberty.
2.  Liberty is impossible without any laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between law and liberty is not a simple inverse correlation.  A society with well-defined and just laws can actually enhance liberty by protecting individual rights and freedoms from arbitrary actions.  The presence of laws that protect fundamental rights and freedoms is crucial for the existence of a free society. Excessive or unjust laws can certainly restrict liberty, but the mere existence of laws does not inherently mean less liberty.

Statement 2 is correct.  Liberty cannot exist in a complete absence of law.  Without laws establishing basic rules of conduct and protecting individual rights, there is a risk of chaos, tyranny, and arbitrary actions that would severely restrict liberty.  A system of laws is essential for establishing a framework within which individuals can exercise their freedoms and liberties while respecting the rights of others.  The rule of law is fundamentally linked to the protection of liberty.


**21. With reference to the Rule of Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rule of Law implies limitations on governmental powers.
2. The Rule of Law requires the government to be responsible to the people.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rule of Law is a fundamental principle that emphasizes the supremacy of law and the equal application of laws to all individuals, including the government.  It inherently necessitates limitations on the powers of government, preventing arbitrary actions and ensuring that the government operates within the bounds of the law.  This principle protects individuals from the arbitrary exercise of governmental power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rule of Law demands that the government is accountable to the people.  This accountability can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as elections, an independent judiciary, and a free press.  The government’s actions should be subject to scrutiny and redressal mechanisms to ensure that it acts in accordance with the law and the will of the people.  Accountability is a critical element in ensuring that the Rule of Law is upheld.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Education (RTE) Act:**

1. The RTE Act mandates that all children aged 6-14 years have the right to free and compulsory education.
2. The RTE Act prescribes minimum teacher qualifications that must be met by all states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, guarantees free and compulsory education to all children aged 6-14 years. This is a landmark legislation that has significantly improved access to education for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Act aims to ensure that all children have the opportunity to receive quality education, regardless of their social or economic status.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTE Act sets minimum teacher qualifications that must be met by all states.  This provision aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning by ensuring that teachers possess the necessary skills and knowledge. The Act seeks to improve the quality of teachers and thereby the quality of education.  This is a key aspect of ensuring that the right to education is meaningfully realized.


**23. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT is a specialized environmental court established through an Act of Parliament.
2. The NGT's primary purpose is to reduce the burden on higher courts by addressing environmental disputes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established through the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, an Act of Parliament.  It is a specialized court designed to handle environmental issues and disputes.  The NGT has jurisdiction over various environmental matters, providing a dedicated forum for the resolution of such cases. The establishment of the NGT is a reflection of India’s commitment to environmental protection.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of establishing the NGT was to reduce the burden on higher courts, such as the Supreme Court and High Courts, by providing a specialized forum for dealing with environmental disputes.  This allows the higher courts to focus on other important legal matters while the NGT efficiently addresses environmental cases.  The NGT's establishment is intended to make environmental justice more accessible and efficient.


**24. Regarding Money Bills, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can only deal with matters related to taxation, borrowing, or expenditure.
2. A Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, deals exclusively with matters concerning taxation, borrowing, and expenditure by the government.  This strict definition is intended to ensure that financial matters are dealt with efficiently and decisively, and that the Parliament has a clear and focused process for handling such critical issues. The definition is specific and limits the scope of a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct.  A Money Bill, once passed by the Lok Sabha, can only be considered by the Rajya Sabha for a maximum of 14 days.  The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill but can only recommend amendments.  The Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations.  This process reflects the Lok Sabha’s greater role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha’s role is limited to review and recommendation, not amendment.


**25. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts.  They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating its policies, serving as a moral compass for governance.  However, they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The non-justiciable nature of the Directive Principles allows for flexibility in policy-making.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are intended to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.  They aim to create a society where social and economic justice are paramount. They seek to reduce inequalities and improve the well-being of the most vulnerable sections of society.  These principles are intended to guide the state towards creating a more just and equitable society.


**26. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body.
2. The NDC plays a crucial role in formulating India's Five-Year Plans.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a constitutional body. It is a non-statutory body established in 1952.  This means its formation and functioning are not directly based on the provisions of the Constitution.  However, it plays a significant role in national planning and development.  Its non-statutory nature gives it flexibility in its operations.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDC plays a key role in formulating India's Five-Year Plans.  It provides a platform for discussions and coordination between the central and state governments on developmental strategies and priorities.  The NDC's recommendations are crucial for shaping national development plans and policies.  The NDC’s role in national planning is a significant aspect of its function.


**27. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha is not subject to dissolution.
2. One-third of the Rajya Sabha members retire every year.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Unlike the Lok Sabha, which is subject to dissolution, the Rajya Sabha is a permanent body, not subject to dissolution. This ensures continuity in the legislative process and provides stability in the upper house.  The Rajya Sabha's permanent nature is a key feature of its design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. One-third of the Rajya Sabha members retire every two years, not every year.  This staggered retirement system ensures continuity and prevents a complete change in the composition of the House at any one time.  The gradual change in membership ensures stability in the House and prevents sudden shifts in power dynamics.


**28. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA aims to provide free legal services to weaker sections of society.
2. NALSA directly handles all legal cases filed by weaker sections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) is a statutory body established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.  Its main objective is to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society, ensuring equal access to justice.  NALSA works to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status, have access to legal representation and justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  NALSA does not directly handle all legal cases filed by weaker sections.  It provides a framework for legal aid and support through a network of state and district legal services authorities.  These authorities provide legal assistance to those who cannot afford it.  NALSA's role is primarily to oversee and coordinate the provision of legal aid, not to directly manage individual cases.


**29.  With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gram Sabha is the primary authority for initiating the process of determining forest rights.
2. State Forest Departments have the final say in determining forest rights.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, gives the Gram Sabha a central role in determining forest rights. The Gram Sabha, which is the village assembly, initiates the process of identifying and determining individual or community forest rights.  This empowers local communities to participate in decisions that affect their livelihoods and relationship with forest resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While State Forest Departments play a role in the process, they do not have the final say. The Act emphasizes the crucial role of the Gram Sabha

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Public Accounts Committee:**

1. It examines the CAG’s report on the appropriation accounts and ascertains whether the funds voted by Parliament are spent within the scope of the demand.
2. It examines the reports and accounts of the public undertakings and finds out whether their affairs are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a parliamentary committee that plays a crucial role in overseeing government expenditure.  Statement 1 accurately reflects one of its primary functions: scrutinizing the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report on appropriation accounts. The PAC ensures that funds allocated by Parliament are utilized for their intended purposes and within the approved budgetary limits.  This involves a detailed examination of government spending to identify irregularities, inefficiencies, or deviations from approved plans.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the PAC does examine government spending, the detailed scrutiny of the reports and accounts of public undertakings falls primarily under the purview of the Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU). The COPU's mandate specifically focuses on assessing the performance and management of these entities, ensuring adherence to sound business practices and efficient resource allocation. The PAC's focus is broader, encompassing all government expenditure, while the COPU specializes in the performance of public sector undertakings.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**2. With reference to the provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  Making provision for reservation to the backward classes is a voluntary provision.
2.  Conferring financial powers on Panchayats with regard to taxes, fees, and so on is a compulsory provision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act, aimed at strengthening Panchayati Raj institutions, introduced both compulsory and voluntary provisions. Statement 1 is correct because while the Act encourages reservation for backward classes, its implementation is not mandatory.  States have the flexibility to decide on the extent and nature of reservations based on their specific socio-political contexts.  This contrasts with other provisions of the Act, which are mandatory for all states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Conferring financial powers on Panchayats is not a compulsory provision under the 73rd Amendment Act. The Act empowers Panchayats to levy, collect, and appropriate certain taxes, duties, tolls, and fees, but the specific powers and their extent are determined by state legislation. This reflects the federal structure of India, allowing states to adapt the Act's provisions to their unique financial contexts and administrative structures.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the functions of the Committee on Government Assurances, consider the following statements:**

1. It examines whether the promises made by the ministers on the floor of the house have been fulfilled.
2. It examines the CAG’s report on the appropriation accounts and ascertains whether the funds voted by Parliament are spent within the scope of the demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Committee on Government Assurances (CGA) is a parliamentary committee responsible for monitoring the implementation of assurances given by ministers in Parliament.  Statement 1 accurately describes its core function: examining whether ministers have fulfilled their promises made during parliamentary debates or sessions.  The CGA's role is crucial in ensuring government accountability and transparency, as it investigates the progress of assurances and reports its findings to Parliament.  This helps in holding the executive branch responsible for its commitments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The examination of the CAG's report on appropriation accounts and the scrutiny of government expenditure falls under the purview of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), not the CGA. The PAC's role is distinct from the CGA's, focusing specifically on financial accountability and the efficient use of public funds. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor's powers:**

1. The Governor's most important legislative power is nominating members to the state legislature.
2. The Governor can dissolve the state legislative assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state plays a significant role in the state's legislative and executive functions. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor does have the power to nominate members to the state legislative council (not the assembly), this is not considered their most important legislative power.  The Governor's primary legislative powers are centered around assenting to bills passed by the state legislature, reserving bills for the President's consideration, and issuing ordinances when the legislature is not in session.  These powers directly impact the legislative process and the enactment of laws.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the state legislative assembly, usually on the advice of the Chief Minister. This power is crucial in maintaining the stability of the state government and ensuring that the government retains the confidence of the state legislature.  The dissolution of the assembly leads to fresh elections and the formation of a new government.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to the voluntary provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  Authorising the Panchayats to prepare plans for economic development is a voluntary provision.
2.  Setting up of a State Election Commission to conduct elections to the Panchayats is a compulsory provision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act contains both mandatory and discretionary provisions for Panchayati Raj institutions. Statement 1 is correct. The act empowers Panchayats to prepare plans for economic development, but this is a voluntary provision. States can choose the extent to which they want Panchayats involved in developmental planning based on their local conditions and administrative capacities.  This flexibility allows for a degree of adaptation to the varying needs and resources of different states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of a State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct Panchayat elections is a compulsory provision of the 73rd Amendment. The SEC ensures the free and fair conduct of elections, contributing to the democratic functioning of Panchayats. This provision is non-negotiable and applies equally to all states, thereby promoting uniform standards in the election process across the country.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), consider the following statements:**

1. It was established under the provisions of Article 312-A of the Constitution.
2. It was set up by an Act of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) is a quasi-judicial body that deals with service matters relating to central government employees. Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAT was not established under Article 312-A of the Constitution. Article 312-A deals with the creation of All-India Services. The CAT's establishment is based on a separate legislative act, the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. This Act created the CAT to provide a specialized forum for resolving service-related disputes, reducing the burden on traditional courts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAT was indeed established by an Act of Parliament, the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. This Act outlines the CAT's structure, powers, and jurisdiction, ensuring its legal basis and defining its role within the Indian administrative system.  This legislative establishment distinguishes it from bodies created through constitutional provisions or executive orders. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. Consider the following statements about the expenditures charged on the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1. Salaries of the Supreme Court judges are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. Pensions of the Chairman of UPSC are made from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the principal fund into which all revenues received by the Union Government are credited. Certain expenditures are "charged" upon this fund, meaning they are automatically paid without requiring parliamentary approval.  Statement 1 is correct. The salaries and allowances of Supreme Court judges are directly charged on the Consolidated Fund. This ensures their financial independence and prevents political interference in their remuneration.  This is a constitutional mandate, reflecting the importance of judicial independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UPSC Chairman's salary is also ultimately from the Consolidated Fund, it is not *charged* upon it.  It is a "voted" expenditure, meaning it requires parliamentary approval before being disbursed.  This distinguishes it from the "charged" expenditures, which are automatically released. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**8. With reference to the functions of the Public Accounts Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. To examine, in the light of CAG’s report, the accounts showing the appropriation of sums granted by the Parliament is a function of the PAC.
2. To examine the statement of accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, the audit of which is conducted by the CAG, is a function of the Committee on Public Undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a parliamentary committee that plays a crucial role in scrutinizing government expenditure. Statement 1 is correct. A primary function of the PAC is to examine the appropriation accounts of the government, comparing them with the CAG's audit report. The PAC analyzes whether funds granted by Parliament were spent as intended and whether there were any irregularities or inefficiencies in the spending process.  This function is central to the PAC's role in ensuring financial accountability of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The examination of the accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies audited by the CAG is primarily the responsibility of the Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU). The COPU’s focus is on the performance and management of public sector undertakings, including their financial aspects.  The PAC’s scope is broader, encompassing all government expenditure, while the COPU specializes in public undertakings. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Contingency Fund of India:**

1. The Contingency Fund of India is operated by the President of India.
2. The creation of the Contingency Fund of India diminishes parliamentary control over public expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Contingency Fund of India is a reserve fund established to meet unforeseen expenditure not provided for in the annual budget.  Statement 1 is correct. The President of India operates the Contingency Fund, drawing upon it only when Parliament authorizes such withdrawals.  While the President initiates the process, the ultimate control rests with Parliament, as any expenditure from the fund must be subsequently ratified by Parliament.  This ensures that the executive branch cannot arbitrarily use the fund.

Statement 2 is also correct. The existence of the Contingency Fund can, to some extent, lessen parliamentary control over expenditure because Parliament's approval is sought *after* the expenditure has been incurred. Though this is a necessary safeguard for emergencies, it does reduce the immediate oversight Parliament usually exercises over budgetary allocation.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**10. With reference to the  provisions relating to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  No expenditure can be incurred without the approval of the Parliament.
2.  The expenditure “charged” on the Consolidated Fund of India is not subject to the vote of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the principal fund where all government revenues are deposited, and from which most government expenditures are made. Statement 1 is largely correct, but needs qualification.  While most expenditures require parliamentary approval (through the budget process), there are exceptions.  The government can't spend money without *some* form of parliamentary authorization, either through the budget or supplementary grants.  Therefore, the statement is true in spirit, though not technically accurate in every scenario.

Statement 2 is correct.  Certain expenditures are "charged" on the Consolidated Fund, meaning they are paid automatically without needing explicit parliamentary approval in each instance. This applies to items like the salaries of the President, Supreme Court judges, and the interest payments on government debt.  These are considered obligatory payments.  Therefore, both statements are largely true, though statement 1 requires careful interpretation in the context of "charged" expenditures.


**11. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend or reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a move for the removal of the Vice-President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, has certain powers, but its powers are not equal to the Lok Sabha, especially in financial matters.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.  A Money Bill, dealing exclusively with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only offer suggestions within a specified timeframe, and the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these suggestions. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government finances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President.  This highlights the Rajya Sabha's unique role in the process of removing the Vice-President from office, underscoring a check and balance in the constitutional scheme. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission recommends on the amount of money to be allocated to the states from the Public Account of India.
2. The Finance Commission's advice is binding on the Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that plays a crucial role in India's fiscal federalism. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission does *not* recommend on the allocation of funds from the Public Account of India. The Public Account holds monies received by the government on behalf of others (like small savings schemes), and its management is distinct from the Consolidated Fund, which the Finance Commission's recommendations primarily address.  The Commission focuses on the distribution of resources from the Consolidated Fund.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the government. While the government is expected to seriously consider the Commission's advice, it is not obligated to accept them fully.  This reflects the government's ultimate responsibility for financial management, even though the Finance Commission's recommendations provide a crucial framework.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**13. With reference to the ordinance-making power of the President, consider the following statements:**

1. It is laid down in Article 123.
2. It cannot be withdrawn at any time by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President of India possesses the power to promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  Statement 1 is correct. Article 123 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to issue ordinances during the recess of Parliament.  This allows the executive to address urgent matters requiring immediate legislative action when Parliament is not in session.  This is an important constitutional provision that allows the executive to act decisively in times of need.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President can withdraw an ordinance at any time.  This power to revoke an ordinance allows for flexibility and responsiveness to changing circumstances.  The President may withdraw an ordinance if it becomes no longer necessary or if unforeseen issues arise requiring its revocation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Lok Sabha:**

1. A Money/Finance Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, holds significant powers, especially in financial matters. Statement 1 is correct. A Money Bill, which deals exclusively with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater role in controlling government finances, emphasizing its direct accountability to the people.  This constitutional provision safeguards the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only suggest amendments, and the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these.  The Lok Sabha's final authority on Money Bills reflects the principle of financial control resting primarily with the house directly elected by the people. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**15. With reference to the presentation of the Economic Survey in Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Economic Survey is presented in Parliament every year before the presentation of the Budget for the coming year.
2. The Economic Survey has no relation with the presentation of the Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Economic Survey is an annual document prepared by the Ministry of Finance that provides an overview of the Indian economy. Statement 1 is correct. The Economic Survey is typically presented to Parliament before the presentation of the Union Budget for the coming financial year. It provides crucial economic data and analysis, informing the budget's preparation and enabling informed parliamentary debate on the budget proposals.  This timing ensures that the budget is informed by the latest economic assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Economic Survey is closely related to the presentation of the Budget. The Survey's analysis directly influences the government's budgetary decisions, providing a basis for formulating fiscal policies.  The Survey's findings and recommendations are central to the budgetary process and contribute to the overall economic policy framework. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the ‘Zero Hour’ in Parliament:**

1. ‘Zero Hour’ is a contribution of India to the Parliamentary System.
2. During ‘Zero Hour’, members can raise matters of urgent public importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ‘Zero Hour’ is an informal period in the Indian Parliament's proceedings where members can raise matters of urgent public importance. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ‘Zero Hour’ is not a contribution of India to the Parliamentary system. While the specific timing and procedures might vary across different parliamentary systems, the practice of allowing members to raise issues beyond the scheduled agenda is common in many legislatures.  It’s not a uniquely Indian innovation.

Statement 2 is correct. During the ‘Zero Hour’, generally after the Question Hour but before the scheduled business of the House, members can raise issues without prior notice. This provides a platform for raising matters requiring immediate attention from the government.  This is a crucial aspect of parliamentary accountability and responsiveness. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**17. With reference to the termination of the sitting of the House of the People, consider the following statements:**

1. Adjournment sine die is a method of terminating the sitting of the House.
2. Dissolution is not a method of terminating the sitting of the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The House of the People (Lok Sabha) can be adjourned or prorogued, or dissolved.  Statement 1 is correct. Adjournment sine die refers to the indefinite adjournment of a House's session, effectively terminating the sitting until the next session is convened.  This is a common parliamentary procedure used to conclude a session.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dissolution is indeed a method of terminating the sitting of the House, but it is a more significant event than a simple adjournment or prorogation. Dissolution signifies the end of the Lok Sabha's term, requiring fresh general elections.  Adjournment and prorogation merely suspend the House's sitting temporarily. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the right to issue money from the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1. The Finance Minister of India has the right to issue money from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. The Parliament of India authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the principal fund where all government revenues are deposited, and from which most government expenditures are made. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Minister does not have the sole right to issue money from the Consolidated Fund.  While the Finance Minister plays a key role in the budgetary process and the allocation of funds, the actual authorization for withdrawal rests with Parliament.  This safeguards against arbitrary executive spending.

Statement 2 is correct.  Parliament, through the appropriation acts, authorizes the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund. This parliamentary oversight is crucial in controlling government expenditure and maintaining financial accountability.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**19. With reference to the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The state with the highest number of reserved seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha is Madhya Pradesh.
2. Reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha does not exist in all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India provides for reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Statement 1 is correct, though the exact number of seats can change with delimitation.  Historically, Madhya Pradesh has had the highest number of Lok Sabha seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes due to its large tribal population. However, this can vary based on periodic delimitation exercises.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha does not exist in all states.  The number of reserved seats varies across states depending on the proportion of the tribal population in each state.  States with negligible or no tribal populations will not have any seats reserved for STs in the Lok Sabha.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**20. Consider the following statements about the period for the Legislative Council to detain ordinary bills:**

1. The Legislative Council can detain an ordinary bill for a maximum period of 3 months.
2. The Legislative Council can detain a money bill for a maximum period of 14 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad), the upper house in bicameral state legislatures, has certain powers regarding the passage of bills. Statement 1 is largely correct, but requires qualification. The Legislative Council can hold an ordinary bill for a maximum period of 14 days, not 3 months.  If the bill is not returned within 14 days, it is deemed to have been passed by the Council. However, the Council can extend this period to 3 months in case of a money bill.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Legislative Council can detain a money bill for a maximum period of 14 days. This shorter timeframe reflects the priority given to financial legislation and the Lok Sabha’s primary role in financial matters.  The Council can only suggest amendments, not reject a money bill. Therefore, both statements are partially correct but with some inaccuracies.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1.  All revenues received by the Government of India, loans raised, and money received in repayment of loans are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  Payments from the Consolidated Fund of India can be made without parliamentary appropriation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 266 of the Indian Constitution explicitly states that the Consolidated Fund of India is the repository for all revenues received by the government, all loans raised, and all repayments of loans.  This forms the primary source of funds for government expenditure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A crucial aspect of the Consolidated Fund is that no money can be withdrawn from it except under the authority of law made by Parliament.  This parliamentary appropriation is a fundamental principle of financial accountability and ensures that the government's spending is subject to legislative scrutiny and approval.  The Public Account of India, on the other hand, can be operated by executive action without parliamentary approval, as it deals with funds that are not part of the government's general revenues (e.g., deposits, remittances).  The distinction between the Consolidated Fund and the Public Account is critical to understanding India's financial system.


**2. With reference to the Contingency Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Contingency Fund is operated by the Parliament.
2.  Advances from the Contingency Fund can be made only to meet unforeseen expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Contingency Fund of India is not operated by the Parliament directly.  It is placed at the disposal of the President of India. The President can authorize advances from this fund to meet unforeseen expenditure that arises before Parliament can approve a supplementary grant.  This ensures that the government can respond immediately to unforeseen circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary purpose of the Contingency Fund is to provide for unforeseen expenditure.  These are expenses that could not have been reasonably anticipated during the budget-making process.  Once the unforeseen expenditure is incurred, the President's action requires subsequent ratification by Parliament.  This safeguard against misuse of the Contingency Fund is an essential element of the system.


**3. With reference to the Public Account of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All public money received by the Government of India is credited to the Public Account of India.
2.  Payments from the Public Account require parliamentary appropriation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Account of India does not encompass all public money received by the government.  It specifically includes public money *other than* that which is credited to the Consolidated Fund of India. The Consolidated Fund is the primary repository for government revenues and loans. The Public Account holds funds like deposits, remittances, and other non-revenue receipts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key difference between the Public Account and the Consolidated Fund is that the Public Account is operated by executive action.  This means that payments can be made from this account without the need for prior parliamentary authorization.  These are generally transactions of a banking or custodial nature rather than government spending on public services.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the states.
2.  The Finance Commission recommends the amount of money to be allocated to the states from the Public Account of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core function of the Finance Commission, as enshrined in Article 280 of the Constitution, is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the states. This is crucial for maintaining a balance of fiscal resources between the Centre and the states, a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's mandate does not extend to recommending allocations from the Public Account of India. The Public Account holds various types of funds, including deposits and remittances, which are not part of the government's general revenue.  Allocations from the Public Account are typically handled through executive action, not recommendations from the Finance Commission.  The Finance Commission focuses on the Consolidated Fund, which is the primary source of government spending.


**5. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's ordinance-making power is co-extensive with the legislative power of Parliament.
2.  The President can withdraw an ordinance at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 123 of the Constitution grants the President the power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of Parliament.  The scope of this power is essentially the same as the legislative power of Parliament. The President can issue ordinances on any subject that Parliament could legislate on, provided Parliament is not in session. This is a crucial power for the President to address urgent matters requiring immediate legislative action.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President retains the power to withdraw an ordinance at any time. This is an important aspect of the power's flexibility.  If circumstances change or if the ordinance is found to be inappropriate, the President can revoke it, removing the need for a parliamentary process to repeal it.  This discretionary power is inherent in the nature of an ordinance.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  It introduced dyarchy at the centre.
2.  It introduced provincial autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did *not* introduce dyarchy at the centre.  Dyarchy, a system of dual government with divided executive powers, was a feature of the earlier Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (1919) but applied only to the provinces. The 1935 Act moved towards a more centralized federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant feature of the 1935 Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy.  This meant that provinces were given greater self-governance and control over their internal affairs.  This was a major step towards greater Indian participation in the administration of the country, though still under the ultimate authority of the British Crown.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President for a period of six years.
2. The CAG can be removed from office only by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG is appointed by the President, the term of office is *five* years, not six.  This five-year term provides a degree of security of tenure, allowing the CAG to function independently without fear of premature removal.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAG enjoys a high degree of independence.  The Constitution lays down a specific process for removing the CAG from office, which involves a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. This rigorous procedure protects the CAG's autonomy and ensures that removal is only for serious misconduct or incapacity, not for political reasons.


**8. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can vote on the Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key feature of the Money Bill is that the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) cannot reject it.  It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha (Lower House) can either accept or reject.  This ensures that the Lower House retains primary control over financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on the Demands for Grants.  The Demands for Grants are presented by the government and voted upon only by the Lok Sabha. This is another aspect of the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on individual demands for grants.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the expenditure “charged” on the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1. The expenditure “charged” on the Consolidated Fund is subject to the vote of Parliament.
2.  The expenditure “charged” on the Consolidated Fund is in the nature of obligatory payment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India is not subject to the vote of Parliament. This type of expenditure is considered obligatory and does not require annual approval by Parliament.  It includes payments like salaries of the President, judges, and CAG.

Statement 2 is correct. The nature of this expenditure is indeed obligatory.  These are payments that the government is legally bound to make, regardless of the annual budget.  The Constitution mandates these payments, removing the need for annual parliamentary approval.  This is a crucial aspect of the financial structure, ensuring that certain essential payments are made without annual political considerations.


**10. With reference to the Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Government.
2. The Finance Commission is constituted at the expiration of every five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the government. The government is free to accept or reject the recommendations, but it is politically accountable for its decisions.  The recommendations, however, provide a crucial framework for fiscal policy.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the constitution of a Finance Commission every five years, or at such earlier time as the President may consider necessary. This ensures a regular review of the country's fiscal arrangements and provides stability and predictability to the system.  The periodic constitution of the Finance Commission is essential for managing India's fiscal federalism.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the President's ordinance-making power:**

1.  The President's ordinance-making power is laid down in Article 123.
2. An ordinance ceases to operate six weeks after the reassembly of Parliament unless approved by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 123 of the Indian Constitution explicitly outlines the President's power to promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  This power is a critical mechanism for addressing urgent matters requiring immediate legislative action when Parliament is not sitting.

Statement 2 is correct.  A crucial limitation on the President's ordinance-making power is that an ordinance will cease to operate six weeks from the date of reassembly of Parliament unless approved by Parliament. This prevents the executive from bypassing the legislature indefinitely.  This time-bound nature is essential to maintain the balance of power between the executive and legislature.


**12. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha consists of 250 members, of which 12 are nominated by the President.
2. The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The total membership of the Rajya Sabha is 250, not 280 or 275. Out of this, 12 members are nominated by the President, representing specialists in various fields such as literature, science, art, and social service.  The remaining members are elected by the members of the State Legislative Assemblies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The members of the Rajya Sabha are indirectly elected by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies.  This indirect election is a key feature of the Rajya Sabha's composition. It is designed to provide representation from the states and to ensure a balance between regional and national interests.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Public Accounts Committee:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee submits its reports to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
2. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee is invariably from the ruling party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) submits its reports to the Lok Sabha, not to the CAG. Although the PAC's work is closely related to the CAG's audit reports, the PAC is a parliamentary committee that reports to the Lok Sabha to maintain the principle of parliamentary oversight.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Conventionally, the Chairman of the PAC is selected from the opposition party. This ensures that the committee's scrutiny of government accounts is relatively impartial and not influenced by the ruling party. The selection of the Chairman from the opposition is a crucial element of the PAC's independence and effectiveness.


**14. With reference to the minimum age for seeking election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The minimum age for seeking election to the Lok Sabha is 21 years.
2. The minimum age for seeking election to the Lok Sabha is the same as for seeking election to the Rajya Sabha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for seeking election to the Lok Sabha is 25 years, not 21 years. This higher age requirement reflects the greater responsibility and experience expected of members of the Lower House, which holds primary legislative power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The minimum age for seeking election to the Rajya Sabha is 30 years, which is different from that of the Lok Sabha. This difference reflects the distinct roles and responsibilities of the two Houses. The Rajya Sabha, being the Upper House, is expected to have members with even greater experience and maturity.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the dissolution of the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha can be dissolved before completing its term only by the President.
2. The Lok Sabha can be dissolved before completing its term on the advice of the Prime Minister.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Lok Sabha has a fixed term of five years, it can be dissolved before the completion of its term. However, this power is vested in the President, not the Lok Sabha itself. The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, making the Prime Minister's role crucial in this process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The decision to dissolve the Lok Sabha before its term is essentially a political one.  The Prime Minister advises the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha, leading to fresh elections.  This reflects the power dynamics of the parliamentary system, where the government's survival is linked to maintaining the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  The President's role is largely formal in this process.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. Directive Principles are justiciable.
2. Directive Principles are borrowed from the Irish Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state in formulating its policies and are intended to promote social and economic justice.  Their non-justiciable nature prevents judicial interference with government policy choices in these areas.

Statement 2 is correct.  Many of the Directive Principles have their origins in the Irish Constitution.  The framers of the Indian Constitution drew inspiration from various sources, including the Irish Constitution, to create a set of principles that reflect India's social and economic aspirations.  The influence of the Irish model is evident in several of the Directive Principles.


**17. With reference to Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, which defines a Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can contain provisions relating to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.
2. A Money Bill can deal with the appropriation of moneys out of the Contingency Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 110 explicitly includes provisions related to taxation within the definition of a Money Bill.  This is because taxation is a core element of the government's financial powers.  The imposition, abolition, alteration, or regulation of taxes are all considered integral parts of the financial legislation that falls under the purview of Money Bills.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 110 also encompasses provisions dealing with the appropriation of moneys out of the Contingency Fund of India within its definition of a Money Bill. The Contingency Fund is a reserve fund for unforeseen expenses, making its management a crucial aspect of the government's financial operations.  Hence, its management is included in the definition of a Money Bill.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha's powers in financial matters:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) cannot reject a Money Bill.  Its powers are limited to making recommendations on the Bill to the Lok Sabha (Lower House).  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these recommendations.  This restriction on the Rajya Sabha's power is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system's financial procedures, ensuring that the Lower House maintains primary control over financial legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha, it cannot amend a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on the content of a Money Bill.  This reflects the principle that the Lower House has ultimate authority in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is consultative, not decisive, on Money Bills.


**19. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. No High Court shall have the jurisdiction to declare any central law to be constitutionally invalid.
2. An amendment to the Constitution cannot be called into question by the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  High Courts do have the power to declare central laws constitutionally invalid if they conflict with the Constitution.  This power of judicial review is an essential safeguard against the potential for legislative overreach.  However, the decisions of High Courts on such matters can be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has the power to review constitutional amendments, although this power is limited.  The Court can determine whether an amendment is consistent with the basic structure of the Constitution.  However, the Court's ability to strike down amendments is not unlimited.  The Court's approach to this issue has evolved over time.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was introduced in the Constitution of India during the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru.
2. The Ninth Schedule protects laws included in it from judicial review.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Indian Constitution by the First Amendment Act of 1951, during Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure as Prime Minister.  This amendment was introduced to protect certain land reforms from judicial review, which were challenged on the basis of fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary purpose of the Ninth Schedule was to provide a mechanism for protecting laws included in it from judicial review.  This means that laws listed in the Ninth Schedule would not be subject to challenge in the courts, even if they violated fundamental rights.  However, the Supreme Court later restricted the scope of this protection.


**21. With reference to Article 142 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary for doing complete justice in any case before it.
2. The decisions taken by the Election Commission of India while discharging its duties cannot be challenged in any court of law.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 142 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court a unique power to pass any order necessary for doing complete justice in any case before it.  This is a very wide power and enables the court to ensure that justice is done, even if it requires going beyond the strict confines of existing laws.  This power is often used in cases where legal remedies are inadequate or where a novel approach is required.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India is an independent constitutional body.  Its decisions, while not routinely challenged, are not immune from judicial review in appropriate circumstances.   The Supreme Court may intervene if there are allegations of serious violations of constitutional principles or legal procedures.  The Election Commission's independence is important but not absolute.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the impeachment of a judge of the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The motion to impeach a judge of the Supreme Court cannot be rejected by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2. The details of the process of impeachment of judges are given in the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha cannot reject a motion for the impeachment of a Supreme Court judge.  Once a motion is properly introduced, it must be processed according to the constitutional procedure, which involves a detailed inquiry and vote in both Houses of Parliament.  The Speaker's role is largely procedural in this process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, lays down the detailed procedure for investigating allegations against judges and conducting the impeachment process.  This Act provides a framework for a fair and transparent process, ensuring due process and protection for the judge while enabling the Parliament to hold judges accountable for serious misconduct.


**23. With reference to the suggestions made by various committees regarding the office of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sarkaria Commission suggested that the Governor should be an eminent person from outside the state.
2. The Rajamannar Committee suggested that the Governor should be a detached figure without intense political links.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sarkaria Commission, which examined Centre-State relations, recommended that the Governor should be an eminent person from outside the state.  This was intended to enhance the Governor's impartiality and prevent undue influence from state politics.  The commission sought to ensure that the Governor could act as a neutral figure in the state's political landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajamannar Committee also stressed the importance of the Governor being a detached figure, free from intense political links or recent involvement in state politics.  This recommendation aimed to strengthen the Governor's position as a non-partisan constitutional authority.  The committee emphasized the need for the Governor to be above the fray of state-level political maneuvering.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959:**

1. The Act exempts several posts from disqualification on the grounds of “office of profit.”
2. The term “office of profit” is well-defined in the Constitution of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, was enacted to address the issue of "office of profit," which can lead to disqualification of members of Parliament and state legislatures.  The Act lists several positions that are exempted from this disqualification, acknowledging that some positions may be necessary for effective governance without necessarily compromising the principles of impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not provide a precise definition of "office of profit."  The interpretation of this term has been a source of considerable debate and litigation.  The courts have played a significant role in clarifying the meaning of "office of profit" in various cases.  The ambiguity in the Constitution's language has made the interpretation of this concept dynamic and context-dependent.


**25. With reference to the Legislative Assembly of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor makes a customary address to members of the house at the commencement of the first session of the year.
2. When a State Legislature does not have a rule on a particular matter, it follows the Lok Sabha rule on that matter.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  It is a convention that the Governor addresses the State Legislative Assembly at the commencement of the first session of the year. This address outlines the government's legislative agenda and policy priorities for the year.  This is a significant event in the state legislature's calendar.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the absence of its own specific rules, the State Legislature typically follows the rules and procedures of the Lok Sabha for guidance. This ensures a degree of consistency and helps maintain procedural order.  This practice is important for efficient functioning of state legislatures.


**26. With reference to the Charter Act of 1813, consider the following statements:**

1. It ended the trade monopoly of the East India Company in India, except for trade in tea and trade with China.
2. It asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the Company.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Charter Act of 1813 marked a significant change in the East India Company's position in India. It ended the Company's monopoly over trade in India, except for the trade in tea and trade with China. This opened up Indian trade to other British companies, leading to increased competition and a greater role for private enterprise in the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 did not assert the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the Company.  The Company continued to govern these territories, although its power was increasingly subject to the oversight of the British Parliament.  The assertion of direct Crown rule over India came later, with the Government of India Act 1858.


**27. In India, which of the following review the independent regulators in sectors like telecommunications, insurance, electricity, etc.?**

1. Parliamentary Department Related Standing Committees
2. NITI Aayog

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parliamentary Department Related Standing Committees play a significant role in reviewing the performance and functioning of independent regulators in various sectors. These committees scrutinize the regulators' budgets, policies, and actions, ensuring accountability and transparency.  This parliamentary oversight is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and integrity of these regulatory bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While NITI Aayog advises the government on various policy matters, it does not have a direct role in reviewing independent regulators.  NITI Aayog's focus is more on policy planning and coordination, while the review of regulators is primarily the responsibility of the relevant parliamentary committees.  The distinct roles of these two bodies must be understood.


**28. Consider the following statements about the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB):**

1. PNGRB is the first regulatory body set up by the Government of India.
2. One of the tasks of PNGRB is to ensure competitive markets for gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PNGRB is a significant regulatory body, it was not the first one established by the Government of India. Other regulatory bodies existed prior to PNGRB's establishment.  The order of establishment of various regulatory bodies is not a commonly known fact and hence is a good distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. PNGRB's mandate includes promoting competition in the natural gas market.  This involves regulating various aspects of the gas sector to ensure a level playing field for different players and to prevent monopolies.  The promotion of competition is a key objective of the regulatory framework.




**1. With reference to the Right to Information Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates the constitution of Central and State Information Commissions to ensure transparency and accountability in government functioning.
2.  Penalties for non-compliance with the Act's provisions can be imposed only by the High Courts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Information Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation that establishes the framework for citizens to access government information.  A crucial aspect of this Act is the creation of Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SICs).  These bodies are empowered to hear appeals and complaints regarding information requests and ensure compliance with the Act's provisions.  Their existence is vital for the Act's effective implementation and for promoting transparency and accountability within the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While High Courts can certainly adjudicate on matters related to the RTI Act through writ petitions, the Act itself empowers the CIC and SICs to impose penalties for non-compliance.  These penalties can range from warnings to monetary fines, demonstrating the Commissions' direct role in enforcing the Act.  The involvement of High Courts primarily arises when there are significant legal challenges or appeals against the Commissions' decisions.  Therefore, the statement that penalties can *only* be imposed by High Courts is a misrepresentation of the Act's provisions.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Lok Sabha:**

1.  The Lok Sabha can be dissolved before the completion of its term only by the President acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
2.  A Lok Sabha candidate forfeits their security deposit if they fail to secure at least one-third of the valid votes cast.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, is subject to dissolution. However, this power is not vested directly in the Prime Minister or the Speaker.  The Constitution explicitly grants the President the authority to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  Crucially, this power is exercised only upon the advice (recommendation) of the Prime Minister, reflecting the principles of parliamentary democracy where the executive is accountable to the legislature.  The President acts as a constitutional head, not exercising independent discretion in this matter.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The condition for a Lok Sabha candidate losing their security deposit is not achieving one-third of the valid votes.  The actual threshold is significantly lower.  A candidate's security deposit is forfeited if they fail to secure a specified percentage of valid votes. This percentage differs from election to election and is set by the Election Commission of India based on the specific constituency.  Therefore, stating it as a fixed one-third is inaccurate and misleading.



**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on State Legislatures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Constitution mandates a bicameral legislature (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council) for all states.
2.  The Governor of a state is an integral part of the state legislature, possessing significant legislative powers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* mandate a bicameral legislature for all states. While some states have a bicameral legislature (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), others function with only a unicameral legislature (Legislative Assembly).  The presence or absence of a Legislative Council is determined by the specific state's circumstances and legislative history.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the Governor is an integral part of the state's legislative process, stating that they possess "significant legislative powers" is an overstatement.  The Governor's role is largely ceremonial and formal.  They do have certain powers like the power to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the Legislative Assembly, but these actions are usually done on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Governor does not actively participate in the law-making process in the same way as elected members. The statement needs to be more precise to avoid ambiguity.



**4. Consider the following statements about the Indian Parliamentary system:**

1.  The President of India holds the power to appoint the Prime Minister and can dismiss them at their discretion.
2.  The Council of Ministers in India is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but requires clarification.  While the President appoints the Prime Minister, this power is not exercised arbitrarily.  The President typically appoints the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The President's discretion is limited; they would not appoint someone who lacks the support of the Lok Sabha.  The President also cannot dismiss the Prime Minister at their own discretion; the Prime Minister can only be removed through a vote of no-confidence in the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  A cornerstone of India's parliamentary system is the principle of collective responsibility. This means that the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha.  If the Lok Sabha loses confidence in the government, the government must resign. This demonstrates the legislature's crucial role in maintaining executive accountability.



**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to vote and to be elected is a Fundamental Right guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The Election Commission of India is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the right to vote and be elected is a crucial aspect of democratic governance, it is not explicitly classified as a Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution.  While the Constitution guarantees various Fundamental Rights, the right to vote is derived from the provisions related to elections and the franchise.  It's implicit in the structure of the Constitution, but not explicitly listed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a single-member body.  It comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and other Election Commissioners. The number of Election Commissioners can vary but usually consists of more than one.  This multi-member structure ensures a more robust and impartial electoral process, reducing the risk of bias or undue influence.  The statement presents a misleading simplification of the ECI's structure.



**6. With reference to the President's rule in a State (Article 356), consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2.  The President's rule suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution in the affected state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 does *not* automatically lead to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.  While the President's rule can lead to the dissolution of the assembly, it's not a mandatory consequence. The President can choose to keep the assembly functioning while assuming control of the state's administration.  The decision to dissolve the assembly is a matter of political judgment and depends on the specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The proclamation of President's rule does *not* automatically suspend the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19.  While certain fundamental rights can be restricted during emergencies (including national emergencies under Article 352), the suspension of Article 19 rights is not an automatic consequence of President's rule.  The suspension of rights requires specific legal processes and considerations.



**7.  Consider the following statements about the Indian Federal System:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a clear division of powers between the Centre and the States, with no overlap or ambiguity.
2.  The Indian federal structure is based on a written constitution and a system of checks and balances between the Centre and States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian federal system, while having a division of powers, does not exhibit a completely clear-cut division with no overlap.  The Constitution includes provisions for concurrent lists (subjects where both Centre and States can legislate), and the Centre's powers can extend to state matters under certain circumstances (e.g., national emergencies).  There is a degree of overlap and potential ambiguity in the distribution of powers.

Statement 2 is correct.  A defining feature of the Indian federal system is its foundation in a written constitution.  This constitution outlines the structure of the federation, the distribution of powers, and the relationship between the Centre and States.  The system also incorporates various checks and balances, such as the role of the judiciary in interpreting constitutional provisions and resolving disputes between the Centre and States.  These mechanisms help prevent any one level of government from becoming overly dominant.


**8. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Local self-government is primarily an exercise in administrative delegation, with limited scope for democratic participation.
2.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments provided for the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj institutions at the village, intermediate, and district levels.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Local self-government in India is not merely an exercise in administrative delegation; it is fundamentally an exercise in democratic decentralization.  The aim is to empower local communities and enhance their participation in decision-making processes that directly affect their lives.  While administrative aspects are involved, the focus is on fostering democratic governance at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments did provide for the establishment of Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies, respectively. However, they do not mandate a three-tier structure universally. The number of tiers can vary depending on the size and characteristics of the area.  While three tiers are common, it's not a strict constitutional requirement for all areas.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers:**

1.  The Parliament's control mechanisms include the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a motion of no-confidence.
2.  The Parliament can directly influence the appointment of individual ministers within the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A crucial aspect of parliamentary democracy is the legislature's power to hold the executive accountable. In India, the Lok Sabha (and not the Rajya Sabha) has the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a vote of no confidence. This mechanism ensures that the government maintains the confidence of the lower house of Parliament.  This is a significant check on executive power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Parliament plays a role in the formation of the government (by electing the party or coalition with a majority), it does not directly influence the appointment of individual ministers.  The Prime Minister generally selects their ministers, with the President's formal approval.  The Parliament's influence on individual ministerial appointments is indirect, through its overall control over the government.


**10. With reference to private member's bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill can only be introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the ruling party.
2.  Private member's bills have never been passed into law in the history of the Indian Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A private member's bill can be introduced by any Member of Parliament, regardless of their party affiliation.  The term "private member" simply refers to an MP who is not a member of the government (Council of Ministers).  Both members of the ruling party and opposition can introduce private member's bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While private member's bills are less likely to be passed compared to government bills due to limited time and the government's majority, it is factually incorrect to say they have never been passed.  Although rare, there are instances in Indian parliamentary history where private member's bills have been enacted into law.  The statement is an oversimplification of the legislative process.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the parliamentary form of government:**

1.  In a parliamentary system, the executive and legislature work independently of each other.
2.  A key advantage of the parliamentary form of government is the executive's accountability to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A defining characteristic of the parliamentary system is the close relationship between the executive and legislature.  The executive (Council of Ministers) is drawn from the legislature and is accountable to it.  They do not operate independently; the executive's actions are subject to the legislature's scrutiny and control.

Statement 2 is correct. One of the significant strengths of the parliamentary system is the executive's accountability to the legislature.  This accountability is ensured through various mechanisms such as question hour, debates, motions of no-confidence, and legislative control over finances.  This ensures that the government is responsive to the elected representatives and ultimately to the people.


**12. With reference to the Cabinet form of government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cabinet system is primarily a device for strengthening the individual authority of the head of government.
2.  Collective responsibility is a defining feature of the Cabinet system, ensuring accountability to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet system is not designed to enhance the individual power of the head of government (Prime Minister).  Instead, it distributes power among a group of ministers, fostering collective decision-making and reducing the concentration of power in a single individual.

Statement 2 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility is central to the Cabinet form of government.  This principle necessitates that all ministers share responsibility for government decisions.  They are collectively accountable to the legislature, and if the legislature loses confidence in the government, the entire Cabinet must resign. This mutual responsibility promotes stability and prevents unilateral actions by individual ministers.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding Judicial Review in India:**

1.  Judicial Review empowers the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2.  Judicial Review in India allows the judiciary to review all legislative enactments before they are assented to by the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Judicial review does not empower the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws. Judicial review focuses on the constitutionality of laws, not their merit or effectiveness.  The judiciary's role is to ensure that laws do not violate the Constitution's provisions, not to assess the legislature's judgment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The judiciary in India does not review all legislative enactments *before* they are assented to by the President.  Judicial review happens after a law is passed, typically when a challenge is brought before a court claiming that the law is unconstitutional.  It is a post-legislative process, not a pre-legislative one.


**14. With reference to democracy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Democracy's strength lies in its ability to activate the intelligence and character of ordinary citizens.
2.  A successful democracy requires a superior individual with dynamism and vision to lead the nation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A fundamental principle of democracy is the active participation of citizens.  Democracy relies on the engagement of ordinary people in political processes, requiring them to use their intelligence and judgment to make informed decisions.  It is the collective wisdom and participation of the citizenry that strengthens a democracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While strong leadership can be beneficial to a democracy, it is inaccurate to state that a successful democracy *requires* a single superior individual.  Democracy is based on the principles of collective decision-making, representation, and accountability.  While leaders play a role, the success of a democracy depends on the broader engagement of its citizens, not just on a single individual's qualities.


**15. Consider the following statements about equality in society:**

1.  Equality in society implies the absence of privileges for certain groups.
2.  Equality in society necessitates the absence of competition among individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of equality is the absence of special privileges granted to certain groups or individuals.  Equality means that everyone should have equal opportunities and be subject to the same laws and rules, without any preferential treatment based on factors such as caste, religion, gender, or social status.  Privileges undermine the principle of equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The presence of competition among individuals is not necessarily incompatible with equality.  Equality focuses on ensuring fair competition, where everyone has equal opportunities to succeed or fail, based on their merits and efforts.  Competition itself is not an antithesis of equality; rather, it's the unfair advantages or disadvantages that can make competition unequal.


**16. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a federation with residuary powers vested in the Federal Legislature.
2. The Act introduced a system of dyarchy at the provincial level, dividing powers between elected ministers and the Governor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act 1935 did establish a federal structure, but the residuary powers were not vested in the Federal Legislature.  The Act gave residuary powers to the Governor-General, reflecting a centralized tendency within the federal framework.  The distribution of powers was not entirely balanced towards the provinces.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Government of India Act 1935 was the introduction of dyarchy at the provincial level.  This system divided subjects into two categories: transferred subjects (under the control of elected ministers) and reserved subjects (under the Governor's control).  This was an attempt to gradually introduce responsible government at the provincial level while retaining some control in the hands of the British.


**17. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:**

1.  An Aadhaar card serves as conclusive proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2.  Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or cancelled.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Aadhaar card is primarily a biometric identification document. While it can be used as proof of identity and residence, it does not serve as conclusive proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal processes and documentation.  Aadhaar only confirms identity and address, not citizenship status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Aadhaar numbers are intended to be long-term identifiers, they can be deactivated or cancelled under certain circumstances.  This might be due to errors in the initial enrollment, security concerns, or requests from the individual.  The statement presents a misleading picture of Aadhaar's permanence.


**18. With reference to the Right to Privacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  The Constitution contains several provisions that indirectly protect privacy, but it wasn't explicitly stated as a fundamental right initially.

Statement 2 is correct.  In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of India recognized the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).  This judgment established the right to privacy as a fundamental right, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the text of the Constitution. This demonstrates the judiciary's role in interpreting and evolving the Constitution's meaning.


**19. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The electoral value of each Member of Parliament (MP) is the same.
2.  The electoral value of a vote cast by a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) varies from State to State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The electoral college for the Presidential election comprises elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of the States.  However, the electoral value of each MP's vote is not equal to the electoral value of each MLA's vote.  The formula for calculating the electoral value is different for both. While the electoral value of each MP's vote is same, the electoral value of each MLA's vote is different for each state and union territory.

Statement 2 is correct. The electoral value of an MLA's vote is calculated based on the population of the state and the number of MLAs.  States with larger populations have a higher electoral value for each MLA vote. This reflects the principle of proportional representation in the Presidential election.



**20. Consider the following statements concerning the Governor of a State:**

1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be instituted against a Governor during their term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a Governor cannot be diminished during their term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution provides protection to the Governor from legal actions during their term.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor while they are in office.  This provision ensures the Governor's independence and prevents undue political pressure or harassment.

Statement 2 is correct.  Another safeguard for the Governor's financial security is the protection against a reduction in their emoluments (salary) and allowances during their tenure.  This provision prevents any attempt to influence the Governor's decisions through financial coercion.  The Governor's financial independence is crucial for their impartiality.


**21. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Committee on Government Assurances scrutinizes and reports to the House on the implementation of assurances given by Ministers.
2.  The Rules Committee is primarily responsible for scrutinizing subordinate legislation to ensure it's within the delegated powers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Committee on Government Assurances plays a vital role in parliamentary oversight.  It examines the assurances given by Ministers during parliamentary proceedings and ensures that these assurances are translated into action.  The Committee's reports highlight the government's performance in fulfilling its promises to Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation, not the Rules Committee, is responsible for scrutinizing subordinate legislation.  The Rules Committee deals with the rules and procedures of the House itself.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines delegated legislation (rules, regulations, by-laws, etc.) to ensure they are within the scope of the powers delegated by Parliament.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly:**

1. The Speaker vacates their office if they cease to be a member of the Assembly.
2.  The Speaker automatically vacates their office upon the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Speaker's position is intrinsically linked to their membership in the Legislative Assembly.  If the Speaker ceases to be a member (e.g., due to resignation, disqualification, or death), they automatically vacate the Speaker's office.  This ensures that the Speaker always remains an active member of the House they preside over.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly marks the end of that particular Assembly's term, the Speaker's office is not automatically vacated. The Speaker's term ends when the Assembly is dissolved, but the office is not vacated until a new assembly is formed.  A new Speaker is elected in the newly formed Assembly.


**23. With reference to Article 356 of the Indian Constitution (President's Rule), consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically suspends Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly, etc.) in the affected state.
2.  The Parliament can exercise the powers of the State Legislature during President's rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 does *not* automatically suspend Article 19.  While the government can impose restrictions on fundamental rights during emergencies, including President's rule, this is done through specific legal processes and only to the extent necessary in the given circumstances.  The suspension of Article 19 is not an automatic consequence.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of President's rule is that the Parliament can exercise the powers of the State Legislature.  This enables the central government to make laws for the state during the period of President's rule, thereby ensuring governance continues.  This power is a reflection of the Centre's authority during exceptional circumstances.



**24. Consider the following statements about the Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The Parliament can add any law to the Ninth Schedule at any time.
2.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule.  This power was initially intended to protect land reforms and other socio-economic legislation from legal challenges. However, this power has been used extensively, leading to concerns about its impact on judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While laws included in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has held that even laws in the Ninth Schedule can be challenged on grounds of basic structure of the Constitution.  Therefore, the statement's claim of complete immunity from judicial review is inaccurate.


**25. With reference to the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Leader of the Opposition must be a member of the single largest party in the opposition.
2.  The recognition of the Leader of the Opposition is based on a prescribed minimum number of seats held by their party.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Leader of the Opposition is typically selected from the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha.  This party must be a significant opposition force, holding a substantial number of seats.  The selection process involves the recognition by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  There is a prescribed minimum number of seats required for a party to qualify for recognition as the official opposition and for its leader to be recognized as the Leader of the Opposition.  This minimum threshold ensures that only significant opposition parties are eligible for this official recognition.  The specific number of seats may vary based on the overall composition of the Lok Sabha.


**26. Consider the following statements regarding the relationship between law and liberty:**

1.  A society with more laws necessarily has less liberty.
2.  Liberty is possible only in a society governed by laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between law and liberty is not simply inverse.  A society with numerous laws does not automatically imply less liberty.  The nature and quality of laws are critical.  Laws can protect liberty by establishing rights and preventing oppression.  Excessive laws or poorly drafted laws can restrict liberty, but the mere number of laws is not a determinant factor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Liberty requires a framework of laws to protect individuals from arbitrary actions by the state or other individuals.  Laws define rights and responsibilities, establishing boundaries that safeguard freedom.  Without laws, liberty is vulnerable to chaos and oppression.  It is a rule of law that guarantees liberty.


**27. With reference to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTE Act mandates a minimum qualification for teachers in a state, as determined by the respective State Council of Teacher Education.
2.  The RTE Act requires candidates for primary school teaching positions to pass a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RTE Act aims to improve the quality of education, and a key component is the quality of teachers.  The Act mandates that states define minimum qualifications for teachers, and these qualifications are usually set by the respective State Council of Teacher Education.  This ensures that teachers meet certain standards of knowledge and training.

Statement 2 is correct.  Another crucial provision of the RTE Act is the requirement for candidates seeking primary school teaching positions to pass a TET.  The TET is designed to assess the candidates' pedagogical skills and subject knowledge, ensuring that only qualified individuals are hired as teachers.  This enhances the quality of primary education.


**28. Consider the following statements comparing the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):**

1.  The NGT is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament, whereas the CPCB is a body created by an executive order.
2.  The NGT's primary function is to provide environmental justice, while the CPCB's main role is to monitor and regulate pollution levels.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NGT is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament, providing it with a strong legal foundation.  The CPCB, on the other hand, is a body created by an executive order, giving it a less robust legal standing compared to the NGT.  This difference in establishment reflects the differing levels of authority and powers they possess.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NGT's primary focus is on providing environmental justice and reducing the burden on higher courts for environmental disputes.  The CPCB, while involved in some aspects of enforcement, primarily functions as a regulatory body, monitoring pollution levels, setting standards, and advising government agencies on pollution control measures.  Their roles are distinct, reflecting the different approaches to environmental management.


**29. With reference to Money Bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money Bills, dealing with financial matters, can *only* be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater control over financial matters, given its role as the directly elected house, more representative of the people's will.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  It can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha within a specified time frame.  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these recommendations.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role in Money Bills reinforces the Lok Sabha's primary authority in financial affairs.


**30. Consider the following statements about the Rule of Law:**

1.  The Rule of Law implies the limitation of governmental powers and the supremacy of the Constitution.
2.  The Rule of Law emphasizes the responsibility of the government to the people but not necessarily equality before the law.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only


**1. With reference to the provisions related to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India has the sole authority to specify which castes or tribes are to be designated as Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in each state and union territory.
2.  The Parliament can amend the Presidential notifications specifying Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, but the President cannot subsequently modify these amendments through further notifications.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution empowers the President to specify Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in consultation with the respective state governors.  However, the President's power is not absolute.  Statement 1 is partially correct as it overlooks the consultation with state governors. The President acts on advice from the state in this matter. Statement 2 is entirely correct, reflecting the supremacy of Parliament.  While the President initially specifies these communities, Parliament holds the ultimate authority to modify these designations through legislation.  The President cannot unilaterally alter Parliament's decisions in this regard.  Any subsequent Presidential notification would need parliamentary approval. This highlights the balance of power between the executive and legislature in constitutional matters concerning Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The process underscores the importance of legislative oversight in ensuring the accuracy and fairness of the classifications, preventing potential misuse of executive power.


**2. With reference to the National Commissions for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Backward Classes, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission for Backward Classes was initially established by an Act of Parliament and later granted constitutional status through a constitutional amendment.
2.  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes is constitutionally mandated to investigate matters related to the constitutional safeguards for both Scheduled Castes and the Anglo-Indian community.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the evolution of the National Commission for Backward Classes.  It was initially a statutory body created through an Act of Parliament but subsequently received constitutional recognition through a constitutional amendment. This reflects a shift from a purely legislative creation to a body with a stronger constitutional backing, enhancing its authority and independence. Statement 2 is also correct.  Article 338 of the Constitution explicitly states that the National Commission for Scheduled Castes has responsibilities encompassing the Anglo-Indian community's constitutional and legal safeguards. This highlights the Constitution's commitment to protecting the rights and interests of this community, integrating it within the broader framework of Scheduled Caste protections.  The inclusion of the Anglo-Indian community under this commission underscores the Constitution's comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of marginalized groups.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies:**

1. The reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies is based on their population proportion to the total population.
2.  The reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the nomination of Anglo-Indian representatives are provisions that were originally intended to be temporary but have been repeatedly extended.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Constitution mandates the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies based on their population proportion to the total population of the respective states. This ensures their representation in the legislative bodies, reflecting their presence in the overall population. The principle of proportional representation is a key element in the design of India’s reservation policy, aimed at achieving a more inclusive and representative democracy.  Statement 2 is also correct.  These provisions, initially set for a limited duration, have undergone repeated extensions through various constitutional amendments. This demonstrates the evolving understanding of the need for continued affirmative action to address historical injustices and socio-economic disparities. The repeated extensions underscore the ongoing relevance of these provisions in achieving social justice and equality.


**4. With reference to the special provisions for certain states in Part XXI of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 371A grants the Governor of Nagaland special responsibility for law and order only during periods of internal disturbance caused by hostile Naga groups.  
2. Article 371 provides for the establishment of separate development boards for specific regions within Maharashtra and Gujarat, with a mandate to report annually to the respective State Legislative Assemblies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the special responsibility granted to the Governor of Nagaland under Article 371A. This special power is limited to situations of internal disturbance caused by hostile Naga groups.  Once the disturbances cease, as determined by the President, the Governor's special responsibility ends. This highlights the Constitution's recognition of the unique challenges faced by Nagaland and the need for a flexible approach to governance in times of conflict. Statement 2 accurately outlines the provisions of Article 371 regarding Maharashtra and Gujarat.  The article empowers the President to establish separate development boards for specific regions within these states. These boards are responsible for equitable allocation of funds and annual reporting to the State Legislative Assemblies. This demonstrates the Constitution's concern for regional disparities and the need for targeted development initiatives.  The reporting requirement promotes transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds.


**5.  With reference to the powers and functions of the Governor of a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor appoints and removes members of the State Public Service Commission.
2. The Governor allocates the business of the government among the various ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a state has the power to appoint and remove members of the State Public Service Commission. This power is an important aspect of the Governor's role in overseeing the state's administrative machinery.  The appointment and removal powers ensure that the Commission is composed of individuals who meet the required qualifications and maintain impartiality and efficiency. Statement 2 is incorrect. The allocation of business among ministers is a function of the Chief Minister, not the Governor. While the Governor holds the formal position as head of the state's executive, the actual executive power vests in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister.  The Chief Minister, in consultation with the Cabinet, determines the portfolio allocation. This reflects the principle of responsible government, wherein the executive is accountable to the legislature through the Chief Minister.


**6. With reference to the provisions related to the Union and State Governments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly mentions the term "Cabinet" in defining the executive structure of the Union and State Governments.
2. The Finance Commission is responsible for maintaining a financial balance between the Union and the States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term "Cabinet" is not explicitly defined in the Constitution of India.  While the Constitution outlines the structure and functions of the Council of Ministers, the term "Cabinet" is used conventionally to refer to a smaller group of senior ministers. The lack of explicit mention in the Constitution reflects its focus on the broader structure of government rather than specific terminology. Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in maintaining a financial balance between the Union and the States. It is a constitutional body established to make recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States, ensuring equitable distribution of resources.  Its recommendations are crucial for fiscal federalism in India, ensuring that both levels of government have adequate resources to perform their functions.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is accountable only to the Parliament and not to the executive branch of the government.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  The CAG is directly answerable to the Parliament and not subject to executive influence. This independence is crucial for ensuring the integrity and transparency of government finances.  The CAG's reports are presented to Parliament, allowing for scrutiny and accountability.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CAG audits the accounts of state governments, it does not compile and maintain them.  The state governments themselves maintain their accounts, and the CAG audits these accounts to ensure their accuracy and compliance with financial regulations. This division of responsibility ensures that the CAG retains its independence and objectivity while carrying out audits.


**8. With reference to the differences between a censure motion and a no-confidence motion, consider the following statements:**

1. A censure motion requires a statement of reasons, while a no-confidence motion does not.
2. A no-confidence motion leads to the resignation of the government if passed, while a censure motion does not necessarily have this consequence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both censure motions and no-confidence motions require a statement of reasons. While the level of detail may vary, both need to clearly articulate the grounds for their adoption.  This ensures that the motions are not frivolous and that the legislature's concerns are clearly understood. Statement 2 is correct.  A no-confidence motion, if passed, results in the resignation of the entire Council of Ministers. It is a direct challenge to the government's legitimacy, forcing its resignation. A censure motion, on the other hand, expresses disapproval of the government or a specific minister but does not automatically lead to resignation. It serves as a critical assessment of the government's performance and can influence public opinion.


**9. With reference to the 73rd Amendment Act on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates indirect elections for the chairpersons of Panchayats at the intermediate and district levels.
2. The Act makes provisions for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does not mandate indirect elections for the chairpersons of Panchayats at the intermediate and district levels.  The mode of election for these positions is left to the discretion of the state governments, allowing for flexibility based on local contexts.  While some states may opt for indirect elections, it is not a compulsory provision of the Act. Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly provides for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes in Panchayats. This reservation is a crucial aspect of the Act’s aim to ensure inclusive participation and representation of marginalized communities in local governance. The reservation policy aims to address historical inequalities and promote social justice at the grassroots level.


**10. With reference to the establishment and functioning of Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are mobile courts that exercise both criminal and civil jurisdiction.
2.  The judgment and order passed by a Gram Nyayalaya are not considered a decree and require separate execution procedures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are designed to be mobile courts, aiming to bring justice closer to the people in rural areas.  They have both criminal and civil jurisdiction, handling a range of cases specified in the Act. This mobility is essential for overcoming geographical barriers and improving access to justice in remote regions.  The dual jurisdiction ensures that a wider range of disputes can be resolved efficiently within the local context. Statement 2 is incorrect. The judgment and order of a Gram Nyayalaya are considered a decree.  To expedite execution, summary procedures are employed. The provision of a decree ensures the legal enforceability of the court's decisions, providing a mechanism for redressal of grievances.  The summary procedure is designed to minimize delays and ensure swift execution of the court’s orders.


**11. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when requested by the President of India.
2.  The UPSC's role in serving state needs requires the approval of the concerned state legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UPSC can serve the needs of a state at the request of either the President or the Governor of that state. The Constitution provides for flexibility in this regard, allowing for both the President and Governor to initiate requests for the UPSC's services, depending on the specific circumstances and nature of the need. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The UPSC's involvement in state matters does not require the approval of the state legislature.  The Constitution empowers the President and Governor to seek the UPSC’s assistance without needing legislative approval. This reflects a balance between central and state authority, ensuring that the UPSC can effectively fulfill its mandate while respecting the autonomy of state governments.  The process remains largely within the purview of the executive branch.


**12. With reference to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts, consider the following statements:**

1. The 99th Constitutional Amendment Act introduced the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) to replace the collegium system.
2. The Supreme Court declared the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act, which established the NJAC, to be unconstitutional.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 99th Constitutional Amendment Act aimed to replace the collegium system for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts with the NJAC.  This reflected a desire to bring more transparency and accountability to the judicial appointment process.  The NJAC was intended to include representatives from the executive and legislature, in addition to the judiciary. Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court subsequently declared the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act, and thus the NJAC, to be unconstitutional.  The court ruled that the NJAC's structure infringed upon the judiciary's independence and its ability to self-regulate. This judgment reinstated the collegium system for judicial appointments.  The decision highlights the importance of judicial independence and the ongoing debate about the optimal method for appointing judges.


**13. With reference to the constitutional amendments related to education, consider the following statements:**

1. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act introduced the Right to Education as a fundamental right, applicable to children aged six to fourteen.
2.  The 86th Amendment Act modified Article 45 of the Directive Principles of State Policy to emphasize early childhood care and education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act introduced a new Article 21A, which guarantees the Right to Education as a fundamental right for all children aged six to fourteen years.  This landmark amendment significantly strengthened the constitutional protection of children’s right to education, making it a justiciable right enforceable through courts.  This underscores the Constitution's commitment to education as a fundamental human right. Statement 2 is also correct. The 86th Amendment Act also revised Article 45 of the Directive Principles of State Policy to focus on early childhood care and education for all children up to the age of six years. This shift reflects the growing recognition of the importance of early childhood development in a child's overall growth and well-being. The amendment underscores the importance of early intervention to ensure that children have a strong foundation for their future education.


**14. With reference to the constitutional amendments related to the anti-defection law, consider the following statements:**

1. The 91st Amendment Act restricted the size of the Council of Ministers at both the Union and State levels.
2. The 91st Amendment Act removed the provision for exemption from disqualification on the grounds of splits in a legislature party.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 91st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced provisions to limit the size of the Council of Ministers both at the Union and State levels.  This was intended to curb the excessive expansion of the executive branch and enhance efficiency and accountability.  The amendment capped the number of ministers as a percentage of the total strength of the respective legislative bodies. Statement 2 is also correct.  The 91st Amendment Act removed the provision that allowed for exemption from disqualification under the anti-defection law (Tenth Schedule) in case of splits within a legislature party.  This stricter interpretation of the anti-defection law aimed to curb political defections and strengthen party discipline. The removal of the exemption clause aimed at reducing political instability and promoting greater adherence to party lines.


**1. With reference to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  It guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, encompassing various facets beyond mere physical existence.
2.  The Supreme Court's interpretation has expanded the scope of Article 21 to include the right to a healthy environment, education, and livelihood.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 21, in its literal sense, guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  However, the Supreme Court of India has adopted a broad and expansive interpretation of this fundamental right.  Over the years, through landmark judgments, the court has recognized that "life" extends far beyond mere biological survival and encompasses various dimensions of human existence.  This includes the right to a dignified life, access to essential resources like food and shelter, protection against arbitrary state action, and the right to a healthy environment. The right to education and the right to livelihood have also been judicially recognized as integral parts of Article 21. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the current understanding and application of Article 21.  Statement 1 is correct as it correctly states the basic premise of Article 21. Statement 2 is correct because it accurately reflects the Supreme Court's progressive interpretation of the right to life and personal liberty.


**2. With reference to Article 275(1) of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  It mandates the provision of grants by the Union Government to states for the development of Scheduled Areas, but not necessarily for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.
2.  The grants under Article 275(1) are primarily aimed at improving the level of administration in Scheduled Areas to facilitate the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 275(1) of the Indian Constitution deals with the grant of special financial provisions for the administration of Scheduled Areas.  While the article doesn't explicitly mention Scheduled Tribes, the purpose of these grants is implicitly linked to their welfare. The grants are meant to address the unique challenges faced by these areas, often characterized by geographical isolation, socio-economic backwardness, and administrative difficulties.  Improving the level of administration is crucial for effective implementation of welfare schemes and overall development of Scheduled Tribes residing in these areas.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it misrepresents the intent of Article 275(1). While it does mention grants for Scheduled Areas, it overlooks the welfare of Scheduled Tribes as the ultimate objective.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the core purpose of the grants under Article 275(1).


**3. With reference to Article 243A of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  It defines the composition and powers of the Gram Sabha, granting it significant decision-making authority in local governance.
2.  The Gram Sabha’s powers are limited to advisory roles, with the actual implementation of decisions resting solely with the Gram Panchayat.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 243A of the Indian Constitution establishes the Gram Sabha as a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of a Panchayat at the village level.  It grants the Gram Sabha significant powers and responsibilities in local governance.  The Gram Sabha is not merely an advisory body; it has a crucial role in planning, monitoring, and implementing development schemes at the village level.  While the Gram Panchayat is the executive body responsible for implementation, the Gram Sabha's involvement in decision-making processes ensures greater participation and accountability.  Statement 1 accurately describes the constitution and role of the Gram Sabha.  Statement 2 is incorrect because it understates the power and influence of the Gram Sabha. The Gram Sabha has a direct role in the decision-making processes,  although the Gram Panchayat is responsible for the execution of these decisions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Gandhian principles reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The concept of a uniform civil code aligns perfectly with Gandhi's vision of a unified and equitable society.
2.  Gandhi's emphasis on rural self-governance and decentralized power structures finds expression in the Directive Principles' promotion of village panchayats and cottage industries.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Gandhi advocated for many social reforms, the concept of a uniform civil code is a complex issue with varied interpretations.  Its direct alignment with Gandhi's specific vision is debatable.  On the other hand, Gandhi's philosophy strongly emphasized rural development, self-sufficiency, and decentralized governance.  His vision of Gram Swaraj (village self-rule) and promotion of cottage industries resonates directly with the Directive Principles' focus on organizing village panchayats and promoting cottage industries in rural areas.  Statement 1 is debatable and not entirely accurate, as the concept of a uniform civil code has diverse interpretations and its direct correlation to Gandhi's philosophy isn't universally accepted.  Statement 2 is correct because it accurately reflects Gandhi's emphasis on decentralization and self-governance in rural areas, which finds a direct parallel in the Directive Principles.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the composition and functions of the Parliament of India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly states that the Parliament consists of only the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
2.  Union Territories are not represented in the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India outlines the composition of the Parliament, which includes the President, the Lok Sabha (House of the People), and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly state that the Parliament *only* consists of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the other components are implied.  The Rajya Sabha represents the states, but not the Union Territories.  Union Territories have representation in the Lok Sabha but not in the Rajya Sabha.  Statement 1 is not entirely accurate because the President is also a part of Parliament, even though it is not explicitly stated that Parliament consists of only Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Statement 2 is correct, accurately reflecting the representation of Union Territories in the Parliament.


**6. With reference to consumer rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Consumers are legally empowered to take samples of food products for independent testing to verify quality and safety standards.
2.  Filing a complaint in a consumer forum always requires a fee to be paid by the consumer.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, empowers consumers to protect their rights.  While the Act doesn't explicitly mention the right to take samples for independent testing, the right to seek redressal and the implied right to gather evidence to support a complaint arguably allows for this. However, this is not a universally accepted right and may depend on the specific circumstances and the forum.  The fee structure for filing complaints in consumer forums varies depending on the forum (District Forum, State Commission, or National Commission) and the value of the claim.  Many forums have provisions for fee waivers for certain categories of consumers, especially those from economically weaker sections.  Statement 1 is partially true, depending on the specific circumstances and the forum. The right to take samples for testing is not explicitly mentioned in the law, but it could be argued that it is implied by the right to seek redressal and the right to gather evidence. Statement 2 is incorrect as it presents a blanket statement about fees that doesn't reflect the realities of fee waivers and variations in fee structures across different forums.


**7. Regarding the office of the Lok Sabha Speaker, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Speaker holds office during the pleasure of the President of India.
2.  A resignation letter by the Speaker must be addressed to the Deputy Speaker.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha itself and holds office until the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  The President doesn't have the power to remove the Speaker.  The Speaker can be removed from office only by a resolution passed by a majority of all the members of the House.  The resignation letter is addressed to the House (and not the Deputy Speaker), which is typically conveyed through the Deputy Speaker.  Statement 1 is incorrect, as the Speaker's tenure is not dependent on the President's pleasure.  Statement 2 is also incorrect as the resignation is addressed to the House, and usually conveyed through the Deputy Speaker.


**8. Which of the following fall under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India?**

1.  Disputes between the Government of India and one or more States.
2.  Disputes between two or more States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India, as defined in Article 131 of the Constitution, includes certain types of disputes.  Importantly, it covers disputes between the Government of India and one or more States and disputes between two or more States.  These are significant cases concerning the federal structure of India and the Supreme Court's role in resolving inter-state and Centre-State conflicts.  Both statements correctly identify categories of disputes that fall under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.


**9. Which of the following are principal features of the Government of India Act, 1919?**

1.  Introduction of diarchy in the executive government of the provinces.
2.  Introduction of separate communal electorates for Muslims.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced significant changes to the Indian political system.  One key feature was the introduction of diarchy (dual governance) in the provinces. This system divided the provincial government into two parts: a transferred part (responsible to the elected legislature) and a reserved part (directly under the control of the Governor).  Another significant aspect was the introduction of separate communal electorates, especially for Muslims. This meant that Muslim voters elected their representatives separately from other communities.  Both statements accurately reflect key features of the 1919 Act.


**10. Which special powers are conferred upon the Rajya Sabha by the Constitution of India?**

1.  The power to create new All-India Services.
2.  The power to amend the election procedure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, possesses certain special powers not shared by the Lok Sabha.  One such power is the ability to pass a resolution empowering Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List, a crucial aspect of federal governance.  This power is not unlimited and requires a two-thirds majority.  Another significant power is the ability to create new All-India Services, which are crucial for maintaining administrative uniformity across the nation.  The election procedure of the President is governed by specific provisions of the Constitution (Article 55) and is not under the purview of the Rajya Sabha’s powers.  Statement 1 is correct and accurately describes a special power of the Rajya Sabha. Statement 2 is incorrect as the Rajya Sabha doesn't have the power to amend the election procedure of the President.


**11. Which of the following are methods of parliamentary control over public finance in India?**

1.  The presentation of the Annual Financial Statement (budget) before Parliament.
2.  The introduction of the Finance Bill in Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary control over public finance in India is a cornerstone of democratic governance.  The Annual Financial Statement, commonly known as the budget, must be presented before Parliament for approval.  This crucial step allows Parliament to scrutinize government spending plans and hold the executive accountable.  The Finance Bill, which contains proposals for taxation and other financial measures, is also introduced in Parliament and subject to its approval.  Both these processes are essential components of parliamentary oversight of public finances.  Both statements accurately describe critical aspects of parliamentary control over public finance in India.


**12. Which provisions of the Indian Constitution have a bearing on education?**

1.  Directive Principles of State Policy.
2.  Seventh Schedule (Union, State, and Concurrent Lists).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Education is a subject addressed in multiple parts of the Indian Constitution.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV) emphasize the state's responsibility to provide free and compulsory education to all children up to the age of 14.  The Seventh Schedule distributes legislative powers between the Union and State Governments.  While education is primarily a State subject, certain aspects fall under the Concurrent List, enabling the Union Government to also legislate on these aspects.  Both statements accurately reflect constitutional provisions related to education.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1.  The CAG exercises exchequer control on behalf of the Parliament during a declared national emergency.
2.  The CAG reports on the execution of government projects are discussed by the Public Accounts Committee.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CAG plays a vital role in auditing the government's accounts and ensuring financial accountability.  While the CAG's authority is significant, the statement that the CAG exercises exchequer control during a national emergency is an oversimplification.  The President's powers during a national emergency are extensive, but the CAG's role is primarily auditing and reporting, not direct control over the exchequer.  The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament scrutinizes the CAG's reports and holds the government accountable for financial irregularities.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it overstates the CAG's powers during a national emergency.  Statement 2 is correct as it correctly identifies the PAC's role in scrutinizing the CAG's reports.


**14. Consider the following statements about the appointment of the Prime Minister of India:**

1.  The Prime Minister must be a member of one of the Houses of Parliament at the time of appointment.
2.  If the Prime Minister is not a member of either House at the time of appointment, they must become a member within six months.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The appointment of the Prime Minister is a crucial aspect of India's parliamentary system.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mandate that the Prime Minister must be a member of Parliament at the time of appointment, it is a widely followed convention. If the individual appointed is not a member of either House, they must become a member within six months of their appointment.  Statement 1 is incorrect as the Prime Minister does not *have* to be a member of Parliament at the time of appointment.  Statement 2 is correct, accurately reflecting the constitutional requirement for the Prime Minister to become a member of Parliament within six months if they weren't already a member at the time of appointment.


**15. With reference to the Delimitation Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The orders of the Delimitation Commission are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be challenged in a court of law.
2.  Parliament can modify the orders of the Delimitation Commission after they are laid before it.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Delimitation Commission is responsible for redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies.  Its orders are generally considered final and not subject to judicial review.  While Parliament can technically amend the Delimitation Act, it cannot directly modify the Commission's specific orders after they are finalized and notified.  Statement 1 is correct because the orders of the Delimitation Commission are generally considered final and not subject to judicial review.  Statement 2 is incorrect as Parliament cannot directly alter the specific orders of the Delimitation Commission after they are finalized.


**16.  According to the Constitution of India, the President is required to lay which of the following reports before Parliament?**

1.  The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).
2.  The Report of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President's role in laying reports before Parliament is an important aspect of legislative oversight.  The Constitution mandates that the President must lay the CAG's report before Parliament, ensuring that the government's financial dealings are subject to scrutiny.  The PAC's report, while vital for parliamentary accountability, is not directly laid before Parliament by the President.  The PAC submits its report to Parliament, but the President isn't directly involved in this process.  Statement 1 is correct because the Constitution mandates that the President lay the CAG's report before Parliament.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the President does not lay the PAC's report before Parliament.


**17. A joint sitting of Parliament is necessitated in case of a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the passage of:**

1.  Ordinary legislation.
2.  Constitutional amendment bills.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 108 of the Constitution provides for a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament to resolve deadlocks.  This mechanism is applicable to ordinary legislation and constitutional amendment bills.  If the two Houses fail to agree on the passage of a bill, a joint sitting can be convened to break the deadlock.  Both statements accurately identify types of bills for which a joint sitting can be called.


**18. Which of the following are included among the Fundamental Duties of citizens in the Indian Constitution?**

1.  To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity.
2.  To protect the weaker sections from social injustice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are moral obligations enshrined in the Constitution to guide citizens towards responsible behaviour.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly list protecting the weaker sections as a separate duty, it's implied in several duties, such as promoting harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood. Striving towards excellence is explicitly mentioned as a Fundamental Duty.  Statement 1 is correct as it reflects a Fundamental Duty explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  Statement 2 is incorrect as it's not explicitly listed as a Fundamental Duty, although the spirit of the statement is implied within other existing Fundamental Duties.


**19. Which of the following provisions safeguard the autonomy of the Supreme Court of India?**

1.  The President consults the Chief Justice of India while appointing Supreme Court judges.
2.  The salaries of Supreme Court judges are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of democratic governance.  Several constitutional provisions safeguard the Supreme Court's autonomy.  The President consults the Chief Justice of India while appointing judges, ensuring that the process is impartial and based on merit.  The salaries and allowances of judges are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring their financial independence from the executive.  Both statements accurately reflect constitutional safeguards ensuring the Supreme Court's independence.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1.  The Prime Minister of India is the chairperson of the NDC.
2.  The Chairman of the Finance Commission is a member of the NDC.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Development Council (NDC) is a body that plays a crucial role in India's five-year planning process.  The Prime Minister chairs the NDC.  While the NDC includes representatives from various levels of government, the Chairman of the Finance Commission is not a member of the NDC.  Statement 1 is correct as it correctly identifies the Prime Minister as the chairperson of the NDC.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Chairman of the Finance Commission is not a member of the NDC.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts:**

1.  The committee scrutinizes the appropriation and finance accounts of the Government of India.
2.  The committee examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Committee on Public Accounts (PAC) is a crucial parliamentary committee that plays a vital role in overseeing public expenditure.  It scrutinizes the appropriation and finance accounts of the Government of India, ensuring that funds are utilized efficiently and effectively.  The PAC also examines the reports of the CAG, which provides independent audits of government accounts, to identify any financial irregularities or deviations from established procedures.  Both statements accurately reflect the functions of the PAC.


**22.  In the context of India's parliamentary government, consider the following principles:**

1.  Members of the Cabinet are also Members of Parliament.
2.  The Cabinet is headed by the Head of State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India operates under a parliamentary system, which has certain key features.  The Cabinet, the executive body responsible for governance, is drawn from members of Parliament.  This ensures that the executive is accountable to the legislature.  The Head of State (President) is the formal head, while the real executive power rests with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.  Statement 1 is correct as it reflects a defining feature of the parliamentary system.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister (Head of Government), not the President (Head of State).


**23. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers at the Centre:**

1.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament.
2.  Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is the executive body of the Union Government.  Collective responsibility to Parliament is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system, meaning that the entire Council must resign if it loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  The President appoints Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, and they hold office during the President's pleasure.  Both statements are accurate descriptions of the Council of Ministers' functioning.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1.  The NDC is an organ of the Planning Commission (now replaced by NITI Aayog).
2.  Economic and social planning is included in the Concurrent List in the Constitution of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NDC was a crucial body involved in India's five-year planning process, but it wasn't an organ of the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog).  It was a forum for cooperation between the Union and State Governments on planning matters.  Economic and social planning is indeed included in the Concurrent List, allowing both the Union and State Governments to legislate on this matter.  Statement 1 is incorrect, as the NDC was not an organ of the Planning Commission.  Statement 2 is correct, accurately reflecting the constitutional provision on economic and social planning.


**25. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1.  The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are not members of that House.
2.  Nominated members of both Houses of Parliament have voting rights in the election of the Vice President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is the Vice President of India, and the Deputy Chairman is elected from among its members.  Nominated members in both Houses of Parliament have voting rights in the election of the Vice President, but not in the election of the President.  Statement 1 is incorrect, as the Deputy Chairman is a member of the Rajya Sabha, while the Chairman (Vice President) is not a member.  Statement 2 is correct, accurately describing the voting rights of nominated members in the Vice Presidential election.


**26. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1.  NALSA's objective is to provide free legal services to the weaker sections of society.
2.  NALSA issues guidelines for State Legal Services Authorities to implement legal programs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NALSA is a statutory body established to provide free legal aid to weaker sections of society.  It plays a crucial role in ensuring access to justice for marginalized groups.  NALSA also issues guidelines and directs the State Legal Services Authorities to implement legal aid programs and schemes effectively.  Both statements accurately describe NALSA's functions and objectives.


**27.  Under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, which authority initiates the process for determining forest rights?**

1.  The Gram Sabha.
2.  The State Forest Department.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, aims to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land or forest produce of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The Gram Sabha plays a crucial role in this process.  The Gram Sabha is the primary authority to initiate the process of identifying and recording the nature and extent of individual or community forest rights.  The State Forest Department's role is primarily to assist and support the Gram Sabha's process.  Statement 1 is correct, accurately highlighting the Gram Sabha's central role.  Statement 2 is incorrect as it downplays the Gram Sabha's primary role.


**28. "Economic Justice" as an objective of the Indian Constitution is mentioned in:**

1.  The Preamble.
2.  The Directive Principles of State Policy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Economic justice is a fundamental goal of the Indian Constitution.  It's explicitly mentioned in the Preamble, which sets out the basic ideals and objectives of the Constitution.  The Directive Principles of State Policy also contain provisions aimed at achieving economic justice, such as ensuring a living wage, reducing income disparities, and promoting social and economic equality.  Both statements correctly identify locations where the concept of economic justice is addressed.


**29. What happens if a Money Bill is substantially amended by the Rajya Sabha?**

1.  The Lok Sabha can still proceed with the Bill, accepting or rejecting Rajya Sabha's recommendations.
2.  The Lok Sabha must send the Bill back to the Rajya Sabha for reconsideration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Money Bills, dealing with financial matters, have a special procedure in Parliament.  The Rajya Sabha can't reject or substantially amend a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's decision is final.  Statement 1 is correct, accurately describing the Lok Sabha's power regarding Money Bills.  Statement 2 is incorrect, as the Lok Sabha is not obligated to send the Bill back to the Rajya Sabha for reconsideration.


**30. Which of the following statements is correct regarding Governors in India?**

1.  The same person can be appointed as Governor for two or more States simultaneously.
2.  The Constitution doesn't prescribe a procedure for removing a Governor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Governor's role as the head of a State's executive branch is governed by constitutional provisions.  While the Governor's appointment is significant, the statement about the lack of a removal procedure is incorrect.  The President can remove a Governor at any time at their pleasure.  Statement 1 is correct, reflecting the current practice of appointing the same person as Governor for multiple States.  Statement 2 is incorrect, as the President can remove a Governor at any time.


**31.  With reference to Indian History, consider the following statements about the Constituent Assembly:**

1.  Members of the Constituent Assembly from the Provinces were directly elected by the people of those Provinces.
2.  The Constituent Assembly was composed entirely of elected members.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Constituent Assembly, which drafted the Indian Constitution, had a complex composition. Members from the provinces were elected by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies, not directly by the people.  Furthermore, the Assembly included nominated members representing princely states.  Statement 1 is incorrect as Provincial Assembly members were elected by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies, not directly by the people.  Statement 2 is incorrect, as the Assembly also included nominated members representing princely states.


**32. Consider the following statements about constitutional amendments in India:**

1.  A constitutional amendment bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.
2.  An amendment affecting the federal character of the Constitution requires ratification by all State legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Constitutional amendments in India follow a specific procedure.  A constitutional amendment bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).  While some amendments require ratification by State legislatures, it's not necessarily all of them.  The requirement depends on the specific nature of the amendment.  Statement 1 is incorrect, as a constitutional amendment bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.  Statement 2 is incorrect, as ratification by all State legislatures is not always required for a constitutional amendment.


**33. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1.  The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Attorney General can vote in the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Attorney General of India is the highest law officer of the country.  They have the right to participate in the proceedings of Parliament, including the Lok Sabha.  However, they are not a member of Parliament and, therefore, do not have the right to vote.  Statement 1 is correct as the Attorney General can participate in Lok Sabha proceedings.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Attorney General cannot vote in the Lok Sabha.


**34. Which of the following bodies are not mentioned in the Constitution of India?**

1.  National Development Council (NDC).
2.  Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India doesn't explicitly mention the NDC or the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog).  These bodies were established through executive actions of the government.  Both bodies played significant roles in India's development planning, but their existence wasn't constitutionally mandated.


**35. The Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India to implement international treaties:**

1. With the consent of all the States.
2. Without the consent of any State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?



**1. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha represents the states of the Indian Union, with each state having a fixed number of representatives proportional to its population.
2.  The President of India nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, who possess special knowledge or practical experience in arts, science, literature, social service, or other fields.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, is the upper house of the Indian Parliament.  Statement 1 is accurate because the representation of states in the Rajya Sabha is based on their population, although the number is not strictly proportional, and there are upper and lower limits on the number of representatives each state can have.  Smaller states have a minimum of one representative, while larger states have a higher number, ensuring that larger states have a stronger voice but not dominating the chamber. Statement 2 is also correct as the President nominates twelve members to the Rajya Sabha, who are typically individuals with expertise in various fields, ensuring that the upper house includes a diverse range of perspectives beyond purely political representation.  This nomination power of the President is a crucial aspect of the Rajya Sabha's composition and function, providing a balance of political and non-political representation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate money bills, which are bills primarily dealing with financial matters such as taxation, borrowing, and spending.
2.  The Lok Sabha can remove the Council of Ministers through a vote of no-confidence, thereby holding the executive accountable.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution of India grants the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, the sole power to initiate money bills.  The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, can make recommendations on a money bill, but it cannot amend or reject it.  This underscores the Lok Sabha's primacy in financial matters and reflects its role as the house of the people, directly elected and thus more closely connected to the financial needs and concerns of the nation. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Lok Sabha holds the executive, the Council of Ministers, accountable through its power to pass a vote of no-confidence.  If the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence motion against the government, the government must resign.  This mechanism ensures that the executive remains responsible to the legislature and prevents the executive from becoming authoritarian.  This power is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy and a critical check on executive power.


**3. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning that they cannot be enforced by courts of law.
2. DPSPs aim to establish a social and economic democracy, guiding the state towards achieving social justice and welfare.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable and enforceable through courts, the Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable.  This means that citizens cannot directly approach courts to demand their enforcement. However, they serve as guiding principles for the state's policy-making and actions. The courts have, in some instances, interpreted Fundamental Rights in a manner that aligns with the spirit of the DPSPs, indirectly influencing their implementation. Statement 2 is also correct.  DPSPs provide a framework for building a welfare state, outlining the state's responsibility to promote social and economic equality, justice, and the well-being of its citizens.  They encompass a broad range of areas, including education, healthcare, and social security, reflecting the Constitution's commitment to a just and equitable society.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs does not diminish their importance; they serve as a moral and political compass for the state, guiding its efforts to create a more just and equitable society.


**4. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Attorney General has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, but not to vote.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General for India is the highest law officer of the country.  Appointed by the President, they hold office during the President's pleasure, meaning their tenure is subject to the President's will.  This ensures that the Attorney General's position is aligned with the executive branch and serves the government's interests in legal matters.  The appointment process is not subject to parliamentary approval, reinforcing the executive's authority over legal matters. Statement 2 is also correct. The Attorney General has the right to participate in the parliamentary proceedings, including speaking and participating in debates.  However, they do not have the right to vote as they are not elected members of either house. This allows the government to present its legal arguments and perspectives directly to Parliament without directly influencing the legislative process through voting. This arrangement balances the need for legal expertise in the legislative process with the principle of separation of powers.



**5. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NDC plays a crucial role in coordinating the planning process between the Union and State governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a constitutional body. It was established by a resolution of the government in 1952. It's not mentioned in the Constitution. The NDC's status as a non-constitutional body highlights the flexibility of India's governance structure. The government can form such bodies to fulfill specific policy needs, allowing for adaptability and responsiveness to changing circumstances.  Statement 2 is correct. The NDC serves as a vital platform for coordinating the planning process between the central and state governments.  It plays a crucial role in formulating national plans, ensuring that both levels of government work together towards common development goals.   The NDC's composition, including the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and other key officials, reflects its significance in national policymaking and the importance of intergovernmental coordination in India's federal structure.


**6. With reference to the provisions related to the proclamation of a national emergency under Article 352 of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can proclaim a national emergency only on the basis of a written request from the Union Cabinet.
2.  If the Lok Sabha is dissolved or its dissolution takes place during the period allowed for its approval, the proclamation remains effective even if it is approved by the Rajya Sabha alone.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's proclamation of national emergency is typically based on advice from the Union Cabinet, the Constitution does not mandate a written request as a precondition. The President can, in principle, act on their own judgment, although this is highly unlikely in practice given the political realities and the established convention of acting on the advice of the Cabinet. The President's power to proclaim an emergency is an exceptional power used only in situations of grave national crisis. Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution provides that if the Lok Sabha is dissolved or its dissolution occurs during the period for the approval of the proclamation, the proclamation can remain in effect even with the Rajya Sabha's approval alone. This provision ensures that a national emergency is not jeopardized by the dissolution of the Lok Sabha and provides for continuity of the government's ability to respond to a crisis.  This demonstrates the flexibility built into the Constitution to deal with extraordinary situations.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the State, typically selecting the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State plays a crucial role in the formation of the State government. Although the Governor enjoys discretionary powers in certain circumstances, the established convention is to appoint the leader of the majority party or coalition in the State Legislative Assembly as the Chief Minister. This ensures that the State government reflects the popular mandate. The Governor's role in this process is constitutionally significant. Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India. This power is primarily used for bills that have implications for national interests or constitutional provisions. The President's assent is required for such bills to become law. This power of the Governor provides a mechanism for central oversight of State legislation, particularly on matters of national importance.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office until they attain the age of 65 years.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State governments, as well as those of autonomous bodies and corporations receiving government funds.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is a crucial constitutional body responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments.  The CAG is appointed by the President and holds office until they reach the age of 65. This ensures the CAG's independence and provides them with security of tenure. The appointment process ensures that the CAG is appointed based on merit and experience, rather than political considerations. Statement 2 is also correct. The CAG's audit responsibilities extend beyond the Union and State governments to include autonomous bodies and corporations that receive financial assistance from the government. This broad mandate ensures that public funds are utilized efficiently and transparently across all sectors. The CAG's reports are submitted to the Parliament and State Legislatures, enhancing parliamentary oversight of public finances.  This wide-ranging audit function is critical for maintaining financial accountability and transparency in government.


**9.  With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to various services under the Union Government.
2.  The UPSC submits its annual reports to the President of India, who then lays them before the Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is a crucial constitutional body responsible for recruiting candidates to various civil services under the Union Government. The UPSC conducts competitive examinations to select candidates based on merit, ensuring a fair and transparent recruitment process. The UPSC's role in selecting competent and qualified personnel is critical for the smooth functioning of the Union Government.  Statement 2 is also correct. The UPSC submits its annual reports to the President of India, who then lays them before Parliament.  This ensures that the Parliament has access to information regarding the functioning of the UPSC and can provide oversight. This accountability mechanism is crucial for maintaining the UPSC's independence and integrity.  The submission of annual reports to the President and Parliament reinforces the UPSC's constitutional role and its responsibility to the nation.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the powers and functions of the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.
2. The Election Commission of India has the power to resolve disputes relating to the splits or mergers of recognized political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India. Its responsibilities encompass conducting elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, as well as the elections of the President and Vice-President.  The ECI's independence is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and the strength of India's democracy. Statement 2 is also correct. The ECI plays a significant role in regulating the activities of political parties.  It has the authority to resolve disputes concerning splits or mergers of recognized political parties.  This power ensures that the electoral landscape remains stable and that political parties comply with the legal framework.  The ECI's role in regulating political parties is important for maintaining order and fairness in the political process.


**1. With reference to the Indian Parliament's law-making process, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament's role is primarily limited to approving bills proposed by ministers, with the majority party often ensuring their passage.
2.  Parliament plays a crucial role in shaping legislation, including debating, amending, and ultimately approving or rejecting bills, even those initiated by the executive.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 presents a limited and somewhat inaccurate view of Parliament's function. While ministers do propose most important bills, and the majority party holds significant influence, Parliament's role extends far beyond mere approval.  The legislative process involves detailed scrutiny, debates, amendments, and potential rejection of bills.  The legislative department drafts bills, but Parliament's committees and individual members play a critical role in shaping the final legislation.  The assertion that the majority party *always* ensures passage is also an oversimplification; opposition parties can and do influence the legislative process through debate and amendment proposals.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the comprehensive role of Parliament in law-making.  It encompasses the entire process from initial proposal to final approval or rejection, emphasizing Parliament's power to modify and even reject government bills.  This highlights the checks and balances inherent in the parliamentary system and the importance of legislative oversight.  Parliamentarians can propose amendments, initiate debates, and exert influence throughout the entire legislative process.  The statement correctly captures the dynamic interplay between the executive and the legislature in shaping laws.


**2.  With reference to the anti-defection law in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The law primarily aims to prevent legislators from switching parties for personal gain, ensuring political stability.
2.  The anti-defection law has led to a situation where party leaders exert excessive control over legislators, potentially undermining individual representation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a primary goal of the anti-defection law: to curb opportunistic shifts in party allegiance that can destabilize governments.  The law seeks to maintain political stability by preventing legislators from changing parties for personal benefits, such as ministerial positions or other incentives.  This contributes to the stability of the government and ensures that the mandate given by the electorate is respected. However, it’s important to note that the law’s effectiveness in achieving this goal is a subject of ongoing debate.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects a potential consequence of the anti-defection law. By making it difficult for legislators to leave their party, the law can inadvertently strengthen the power of party leaders over individual members.  This can stifle dissent and limit the expression of diverse viewpoints within the legislature, potentially hindering genuine representation of constituents' interests.  The law, while intended to promote stability, can also create a system where individual legislators feel pressured to conform to the party line, even if it conflicts with their own beliefs or their constituents' desires.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the independence of the Indian judiciary:**

1.  The Indian Constitution ensures judicial independence through measures such as fixed tenure for judges and a difficult removal process, shielding them from political pressure.
2. The appointment of judges, while aiming for impartiality, is not entirely free from political influence and controversy, impacting judicial decisions and interpretations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights key constitutional provisions designed to safeguard judicial independence.  The fixed tenure protects judges from arbitrary removal, allowing them to make impartial decisions without fear of reprisal.  The constitutionally prescribed, complex removal procedure further reinforces this independence, ensuring that judges cannot be easily dismissed due to political disagreements or pressure. This is crucial for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.

Statement 2 acknowledges the complexities of judicial appointments. While the process aims for merit and impartiality, it's recognized that political considerations and controversies can, and do, arise. The selection of judges, particularly at the higher levels, can be influenced by political factors, impacting the court's composition and potentially influencing judicial philosophies and interpretations of the law.  This doesn't necessarily negate the existence of judicial independence but highlights the ongoing challenges in maintaining it completely free from political pressures.


**4. With reference to the role of Parliament in overseeing legislation, consider the following statements:**

1. The system of parliamentary committees significantly enhances the Parliament's ability to scrutinize and appraise legislation, ensuring thorough review before enactment.
2.  Parliamentary committees, while helpful, do not completely eliminate the possibility of flawed or hastily passed legislation, due to limitations in time and resources.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the enhanced oversight provided by parliamentary committees. These committees conduct detailed examinations of bills, allowing for thorough scrutiny and expert input before the bills are presented to the full Parliament for debate and voting.  This process helps to identify potential flaws, inconsistencies, or unintended consequences, improving the quality of legislation and ensuring that it is well-considered before becoming law.  The committees provide a mechanism for in-depth analysis that is often beyond the capacity of the full Parliament.

Statement 2 acknowledges the inherent limitations of the committee system. Despite the enhanced scrutiny, time constraints, resource limitations, and the sheer volume of legislation can still allow for some flawed or hastily considered laws to be passed.  The committees do their best to ensure thorough review, but they cannot guarantee perfection.  The complexities of modern governance and the pressing need for legislation mean that some compromises may be made in the quest for complete and perfect oversight.


**5. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The division of powers between the Centre and States is clearly defined, leading to a balanced distribution of authority.
2.  The unequal representation of federating units in the Rajya Sabha reflects a departure from the ideal of perfect symmetry in a federal structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1, while generally true, requires nuance. The Indian Constitution does strive for a clear division of powers between the Centre and the States through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. However, the reality is more complex.  Areas of overlap and potential conflict exist, necessitating judicial interpretation and political negotiation.  The division of powers is not static; its interpretation and application evolve over time, often leading to debates about the balance of power.

Statement 2 correctly points out the inherent asymmetry in India's federal structure.  The Rajya Sabha, representing the States, does not provide equal representation to all States.  States with larger populations have more representatives than smaller ones. This inherent inequality is a feature of the Indian federal system and reflects a compromise between the principles of equality and the need to accommodate diverse population sizes.  This asymmetry, while present, does not negate the overall federal nature of the system, but it is a point of significant discussion in analyzing the Indian federal structure.


**6. With reference to the functions of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC's role is primarily advisory, offering recommendations to the executive rather than making binding decisions on appointments and other personnel matters.
2. The President of India has the authority to exclude certain posts, services, or matters from the purview of UPSC consultation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the UPSC's advisory function.  While the UPSC plays a crucial role in recruitment and other personnel matters for the Union and State governments, its recommendations are not legally binding. The executive branch retains the ultimate authority to make decisions on appointments and other personnel issues.  The UPSC's role is to ensure fairness, transparency, and merit in these processes by providing expert advice and recommendations based on rigorous evaluation.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the President's power regarding UPSC consultation.  The Constitution grants the President the authority to exempt certain posts, services, or matters from the requirement of UPSC consultation. This power is usually exercised sparingly and in exceptional circumstances, but it does exist as a constitutional provision. This power exists to allow flexibility for the executive in specific situations where the UPSC's standard procedures might not be entirely appropriate.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Governor's powers in a state:**

1. The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to the President of India.
2. The Governor always acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, except in certain specific circumstances outlined in the Constitution.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely incorrect. While the Governor shares some powers with the President, there are significant differences. The President is the head of the Union executive, while the Governor is the constitutional head of the state executive.  The Governor's powers are mostly exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, while the President does enjoy certain discretionary powers.  The Governor lacks the President's extensive powers concerning national security, foreign affairs, and constitutional amendments. The Governor has no judicial powers in the same manner as the Supreme Court, and the judiciary is independent of the executive.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Governor is bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers in most matters. The Constitution provides for certain exceptions where the Governor can exercise discretionary powers, but these are limited and usually involve situations such as the appointment of the Chief Minister or the imposition of President's Rule.  The principle of ministerial responsibility ensures that the government is accountable to the state legislature.


**8. With reference to the State Legislative Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Legislative Council is a permanent house and cannot be dissolved.
2. The Council has equal powers with the Legislative Assembly in all spheres, except financial matters and control over the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The State Legislative Council, unlike the Legislative Assembly, is a permanent house; it cannot be dissolved.  While individual members have a fixed term, the Council itself continues to exist.  This is in contrast to the Assembly, which is subject to dissolution. This reflects the Council's intended role as a more deliberative and less directly representative body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The State Legislative Council does not have equal powers with the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly holds significantly more power, particularly in financial matters.  The Council can delay bills but cannot ultimately prevent their passage.  The Council's role is primarily advisory and less influential compared to the Assembly, which is directly elected by the people.  The Council's powers are subordinate to those of the Assembly in most areas.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Public Accounts Committee (PAC):**

1. The PAC examines the appropriation accounts and ascertains whether the funds voted by Parliament are spent within the scope of the demand.
2. The PAC examines the reports and accounts of public undertakings, ensuring their affairs are managed according to sound business principles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes one of the primary functions of the PAC. The PAC examines the appropriation accounts, which detail how government funds are spent.  It verifies that the expenditure aligns with the grants approved by Parliament.  This is a crucial aspect of parliamentary oversight of public finance, ensuring accountability and preventing misuse of public funds.  The PAC's scrutiny helps to maintain financial discipline and transparency in government spending.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The examination of the reports and accounts of public undertakings is the responsibility of the Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU), not the PAC. The PAC focuses primarily on the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) relating to government expenditure. While both committees contribute to parliamentary oversight, they have distinct areas of responsibility.  The COPU's focus on public sector enterprises complements the PAC's focus on government expenditure.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject them.
2.  The Lok Sabha's Speaker has the final authority to determine whether a particular bill is a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions concerning Money Bills.  The Constitution explicitly vests the power to introduce Money Bills solely in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations, but it cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters, as it directly represents the people and holds greater accountability for public funds.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role in this area is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Constitution explicitly grants the Speaker of the Lok Sabha the final authority to decide whether a bill is a Money Bill.  This power is crucial, as it prevents disputes and ensures the smooth functioning of the legislative process. The Speaker's decision on this matter is binding and cannot be challenged in court.  This power, while potentially subject to debate, is a critical component of the system designed to manage financial legislation.


**11. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the President's rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.
2.  The imposition of President's rule results in the removal of the State Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the assembly functioning, although this is less common. The decision to dissolve the assembly is a separate action taken by the President on the advice of the Union government, considering the specific circumstances in the state.  The Constitution does not mandate automatic dissolution upon the imposition of President's Rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The imposition of President's Rule invariably leads to the removal of the State Council of Ministers.  This is because the Council of Ministers is responsible to the State Legislative Assembly, and with the imposition of President's Rule, the Assembly's functions are suspended.  The Governor, acting on the advice of the Union government, assumes the executive powers of the state, and the existing Council of Ministers is consequently dismissed.  This is an inherent part of the process of imposing President's Rule.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission resolves disputes relating to splits or mergers of recognized political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a single-member body. While the Chief Election Commissioner heads the ECI, the commission also includes other Election Commissioners appointed by the President.  The number of Election Commissioners can vary depending on the needs and workload of the ECI.  The current structure has a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.

Statement 2 is correct. The ECI's powers extend to resolving disputes related to the splits or mergers of recognized political parties.  The ECI plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and fairness of the electoral process, including the regulation of political parties.  Its decisions on such matters are crucial for maintaining order and stability in the political landscape.  The ECI's authority in this area is well-established and important for upholding the democratic process.


**13. With reference to parliamentary privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliamentary privileges extend to members of Parliament, committees, and certain individuals entitled to participate in parliamentary proceedings, but not the President.
2.  Collective privileges enjoyed by each House include the power to publish its proceedings, punish those who breach privileges, and prohibit court inquiry into its proceedings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the scope of parliamentary privileges.  These privileges are designed to protect the independence and effectiveness of Parliament and its members.  They extend to individuals like ministers and the Attorney General who participate in parliamentary proceedings.  However, the President, while an integral part of Parliament, is not subject to parliamentary privileges.  This is because the President is considered above the legislative process, and holding them accountable for their actions would create a conflict of interest.

Statement 2 accurately lists key collective privileges.  Each House of Parliament enjoys the power to control its own proceedings, including publishing its debates and records.  This is essential for transparency and accountability. The power to punish those who breach privileges or contempt of the House is also crucial for maintaining order and respect for the institution.  The prohibition of court inquiry into parliamentary proceedings further protects the House's autonomy and prevents interference from the judiciary.  These privileges are fundamental to the functioning of Parliament.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Contingency Fund of India:**

1. The creation of the Contingency Fund diminishes parliamentary control over public expenditure.
2. The Contingency Fund is operated by the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Contingency Fund of India, while intended to address unforeseen expenditure, does reduce, to some extent, parliamentary control over public funds.  Parliament approves the creation of the fund but does not directly control its day-to-day use.  The President authorizes withdrawals from the fund in emergency situations, which can occur without immediate parliamentary approval.  This aspect of the fund's operation reduces the level of direct parliamentary oversight.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Contingency Fund of India is operated by the President. The President authorizes withdrawals from the fund on the recommendation of the government to meet unforeseen emergencies.  This is a constitutional provision, reflecting the President's executive role and the need for swift action in crisis situations.  The fund's operation under the President's authority ensures that urgent financial needs can be met without undue delay.  Parliament is subsequently informed of these withdrawals.


**15. With reference to the different types of grants in the Indian budget, consider the following statements:**

1. A vote-on-account is granted to allow sufficient time for legislative scrutiny and discussion of the budget.
2.  Excess grants are submitted directly to the Lok Sabha for approval.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly explains the purpose of a vote-on-account.  A vote-on-account is a temporary grant of funds to the government when the regular budget has not been passed by the end of the financial year.  It provides the government with sufficient funds to continue its operations while the budget is still under consideration by Parliament.  This ensures that essential services are not disrupted due to the delay in budget approval.  The vote-on-account allows time for detailed scrutiny and discussion of the budget.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Excess grants are not submitted directly to the Lok Sabha.  They are presented to the Lok Sabha after the financial year has ended, to regularize expenditure incurred in excess of the amounts granted by Parliament during the year.  This process requires parliamentary approval, but it occurs after the fact, to address the already incurred expenditure.  The procedure for excess grants differs from that of other types of grants.


**16. With reference to expenditures charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Salaries of Supreme Court judges and emoluments of the Prime Minister are charged on the Consolidated Fund.
2.  Pensions of the Chairman of the UPSC and debt charges for which the Government of India is liable are charged on the Consolidated Fund.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Certain expenditures are constitutionally mandated to be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.  These include the salaries and allowances of the judges of the Supreme Court and the emoluments and allowances of the Prime Minister.  These are not subject to the vote of Parliament, reflecting their constitutional status and importance.  This ensures their timely payment without parliamentary delays.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Pensions of the Chairman of the UPSC and debt charges (interest payments on government borrowings) are also charged on the Consolidated Fund.  These are essential expenditures that are not subject to annual parliamentary vote.  Their inclusion in the charged expenditure ensures their timely payment and reflects the government's obligations in these areas.  These expenditures are considered obligatory and non-discretionary.


**17. Consider the following statements about the functions of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC):**

1. The PAC examines the accounts showing the appropriation of sums granted by Parliament, in the light of the CAG's report.
2. The PAC examines the statement of accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, whose audit is conducted by the CAG.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key function of the PAC.  The PAC's primary role is to scrutinize the appropriation accounts of the government, examining how the funds granted by Parliament have been utilized.  It does so in conjunction with the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which provide an independent audit of government finances. This ensures that public money is spent responsibly and efficiently, in line with parliamentary approval.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The examination of the accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies is not a primary function of the PAC.  Such bodies often have their own audit mechanisms, and their accounts may be reviewed by other parliamentary committees or oversight bodies, depending on their specific nature and mandate.  The PAC's focus remains primarily on the appropriation accounts and the CAG's reports on government spending.  The PAC's role is distinct from the oversight of autonomous bodies.


**18. With reference to the adjournment motion in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The adjournment motion is used to interrupt the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.
2. The adjournment motion can be used by the Rajya Sabha to remove the government from office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the purpose of an adjournment motion.  It is a device used by the opposition to interrupt the normal business of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.  If the motion is admitted, the House adjourns its scheduled business to discuss the urgent issue.  This mechanism provides a way for the opposition to raise pressing matters and hold the government accountable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The adjournment motion cannot be used by the Rajya Sabha (or the Lok Sabha) to remove the government from office.  This power is vested in a no-confidence motion, which is a distinct parliamentary procedure.  The adjournment motion is focused on bringing attention to a specific urgent issue, while a no-confidence motion is concerned with the overall confidence of the House in the government.  They are separate mechanisms serving distinct purposes.


**19. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC was set up in 1964 as a statutory body with advisory functions similar to the UPSC.
2. The CVC's mode of receiving complaints is similar to that of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in the UK.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The CVC was established in 1964, and while not initially a statutory body, it later gained statutory status.  Its functions are primarily advisory, similar to the UPSC, focusing on promoting integrity and preventing corruption in the government.  The CVC investigates corruption complaints and makes recommendations but does not have the power to impose penalties.  Its advisory role is crucial for promoting ethical conduct within the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CVC's mode of receiving complaints differs significantly from that of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in the UK.  The UK system emphasizes proactive investigation, while the CVC relies more on complaints received from various sources.  The methods of investigation and the level of authority also differ substantially between the two systems.  The comparison is not accurate in terms of the process of receiving and handling complaints.


**20. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC derives its functions solely from the Constitution of India.
2. The President of India can place the personnel system of any local authority under the jurisdiction of the UPSC.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UPSC's primary functions are defined in the Constitution, its powers and responsibilities have also been expanded through subsequent legislation and executive orders.  The Constitution provides the foundational framework, but the UPSC's role has evolved over time, incorporating additional responsibilities and functions not explicitly mentioned in the original text.  The statement oversimplifies the source of the UPSC's authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India has the power, under certain circumstances, to bring the personnel system of local authorities under the purview of the UPSC.  This is a constitutional provision that allows for the extension of the UPSC's expertise and oversight to other entities, particularly when fairness and merit in appointments are crucial.  This power is used strategically to improve the quality of personnel management in various organizations.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate the removal of the Vice-President.
2. The Lok Sabha alone can initiate a resolution for the discontinuance of a national emergency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution explicitly grants the Rajya Sabha the sole power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President.  A resolution for removal must be passed by the Rajya Sabha by a special majority and then agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority.  The Lok Sabha has no power to initiate this process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The power to pass a resolution for the discontinuance of a national emergency rests solely with the Lok Sabha. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power and accountability in matters concerning the executive branch and national governance. The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the matter but cannot pass the resolution.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend or reject a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can introduce a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha possesses limited powers regarding Money Bills. It cannot amend or reject a Money Bill. It can only return the bill to the Lok Sabha with or without recommendations within 14 days. The Lok Sabha can then either accept or reject these recommendations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Only the Lok Sabha has the power to introduce a Money Bill. This is a crucial aspect of the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters, reflecting its role as the body directly representing the people and responsible for approving government spending.


**3. With reference to the legislative powers of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in the passage of a Financial Bill that contains matters beyond those specified in Article 110.
2. The Lok Sabha can reject all the recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha on a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Lok Sabha has exclusive power to initiate Money Bills and Financial Bills (those solely concerning Article 110 matters), both houses have equal powers in the passage of Financial Bills that extend beyond the scope of Article 110. This reflects a balance of power where the Rajya Sabha can influence legislation but not control it completely concerning financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha holds the final say on Money Bills.  It can accept or reject all or any of the Rajya Sabha's recommendations.  The Lok Sabha's decision is final in such cases, signifying its primary role in budgetary matters.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliament's functions:**

1. The Parliament selects the ministers, including the Prime Minister.
2. The Parliament can enlarge the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the President formally appoints ministers, the selection process is effectively controlled by the Parliament. The Prime Minister, chosen by the majority party (or coalition), recommends the appointment of other ministers to the President.  Parliamentary confidence is essential for the government to function.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Parliament's power to amend the Constitution allows it to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  This reflects the Parliament's authority to shape the judicial landscape and redefine the Supreme Court's scope of operation.  This power is not unlimited, however, as judicial review may constrain these amendments.


**5. With reference to the role of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on the demands for grants.
2. The Rajya Sabha can remove the Council of Ministers by passing a no-confidence motion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's role in budgetary matters is limited to discussion. The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to vote on the demands for grants. This reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected lower house.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible only to the Lok Sabha.  A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can scrutinize and criticize government policies but cannot bring down the government through a no-confidence vote.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha's special powers:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can authorize Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List.
2. The Rajya Sabha can authorise the Parliament to create new All-India Services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 of the Constitution allows the Rajya Sabha to resolve that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest for Parliament to make laws on matters within the State List. This power is used sparingly, reflecting the federal nature of the Indian system.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 312 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to create new All-India Services, but only if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to this effect. This demonstrates the Rajya Sabha’s role in creating a national administrative structure.


**7. With reference to parliamentary privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliamentary privileges extend to the President of India.
2.  Each House of Parliament has the right to publish its reports, debates, and proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Parliamentary privileges do not extend to the President, despite the President's integral role in the Parliament. This is because the President is a part of the executive branch and is not subject to the same rules and procedures as the legislative houses.

Statement 2 is correct. Each House of Parliament enjoys the privilege of publishing its proceedings.  However, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 introduced limitations, allowing the publication of true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission, except in the case of secret sittings.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Lok Sabha Speaker presides over joint sittings of both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is not appointed by the President and does not hold office at the pleasure of the President. The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha and holds office until the dissolution of the Lok Sabha or until resignation or removal.  

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over joint sittings of both Houses of Parliament. This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominant position in joint sittings, as it has the larger number of members, which can be decisive in resolving legislative deadlocks.


**9. With reference to the appointment of judges, consider the following statements:**

1.  The appointment of judges is completely free from political controversy.
2.  The senior-most judge of the Supreme Court is always appointed as the Chief Justice of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The appointment of judges, particularly to the higher judiciary, has historically been a source of political controversy. The process involves consultations and considerations that can be influenced by political factors, leading to debates and disagreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the convention of appointing the senior-most judge as the Chief Justice of India has been followed for a considerable period, it has been broken on some occasions, highlighting the political aspects of this critical appointment.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judiciary:**

1. The judiciary is independent of political pressures.
2. The judiciary is completely unaccountable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Indian Constitution has established mechanisms to ensure the independence of the judiciary, including the security of tenure for judges, a specific procedure for their removal, and financial independence.  However, complete insulation from political influence is difficult to achieve in any political system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the judiciary enjoys significant independence, it is not completely unaccountable.  It is accountable to the Constitution and the rule of law.  Judicial decisions can be reviewed, and judges are subject to ethical standards and potential impeachment under exceptional circumstances.  Public opinion and the media also play a role in holding the judiciary accountable.


**11. With reference to the collective privileges of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can punish members for breach of privileges.
2. Courts can inquire into the proceedings of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Each House of Parliament possesses the power to punish its members, as well as outsiders, for breaches of privilege or contempt. This power is essential to maintain the dignity and authority of Parliament and ensure its effective functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Courts are generally prohibited from inquiring into the proceedings of Parliament or its committees. This principle of parliamentary privilege protects the legislative process from judicial interference and ensures the independence of Parliament.


**12. Consider the following statements about individual privileges of Parliament members:**

1. Members of Parliament cannot be arrested during a parliamentary session and for 40 days before and after the session in civil cases.
2. Members of Parliament are exempted from jury service and can refuse to give evidence in court during a parliamentary session, even in criminal cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. This privilege protects Members of Parliament from harassment through civil suits during their parliamentary duties, allowing them to focus on their legislative responsibilities. The protection does not extend to criminal cases or preventive detention.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Members of Parliament are exempted from jury service and can often refuse to give evidence during a session, this privilege does not extend to criminal cases.  The balance between parliamentary privilege and the administration of justice requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances.


**13. With reference to the functions of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget but cannot vote on the demands for grants.
2. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a motion of no-confidence against the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's power regarding the budget is limited to discussion; it cannot vote on the demands for grants. This is a key difference between the two houses, reflecting the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can debate and express its views on government policies but cannot initiate a motion to remove the government.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Lok Sabha:**

1.  The Lok Sabha can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President.
2. The Lok Sabha has the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President.  While the Rajya Sabha also participates, the Lok Sabha initiates the process by passing a resolution by a special majority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha holds the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion.  This power is a fundamental aspect of parliamentary democracy, ensuring the executive branch's accountability to the legislature.  The Rajya Sabha does not have this power.


**15. With reference to the financial powers of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution mandates that a Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the principle that the house directly elected by the people has primary control over financial legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only suggest amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha's decision is final in this matter, reinforcing its dominance in financial affairs.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily one of review and suggestion, not veto power.


**16. Consider the following statements concerning the passage of bills:**

1.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can indefinitely delay the passage of an ordinary bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution grants the Lok Sabha exclusive power to introduce Money Bills, reflecting its role as the house primarily representing the people in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can delay the passage of an ordinary bill by referring it to a committee or through prolonged debate, it cannot indefinitely delay it.  Ultimately, the Lok Sabha's power, combined with the possibility of a joint sitting to resolve deadlocks, limits the Rajya Sabha's ability to obstruct legislation indefinitely.


**17. With reference to the composition of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha represents the states.
2. The Lok Sabha represents the people of India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President has the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament.  This is a form of veto power, although it is rarely used in practice.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President can return a bill to Parliament for reconsideration, except for a Money Bill. This gives the President the opportunity to seek clarification or suggest amendments before giving assent. This power, similar to a "pocket veto", allows for a form of review of the legislative process.


**19. With reference to the process of lawmaking, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill becomes a law only after it receives the assent of the President.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, initiates impeachment proceedings against the President.  While the Rajya Sabha participates in the process, the Lok Sabha's role is paramount, reflecting its primary accountability to the people.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the UPSC's primary functions are outlined in the Constitution, Parliament can extend its functions through legislation.  This allows for adaptation to evolving needs and expansion of the UPSC's role in public administration.  The President acts on the advice of the government in this regard.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Election Commission of India has the authority to resolve disputes concerning the splits or mergers of recognized political parties. This power is crucial for maintaining the stability and integrity of the political system.  It helps to prevent arbitrary splits and ensure that the recognition of political parties is based on clear criteria.


**23. With reference to the Governor of a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President.

**24. Consider the following statements about the Chief Minister:**

1. The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 2 is also correct. The Council of Ministers in a state is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy, ensuring the state government's accountability to the state legislature.  A vote of no confidence can remove the Council of Ministers.


**25. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. A member of a legislature will be disqualified if he voluntarily gives up the membership of the party to which he belonged.
2. Absence from voting in the house on a particular issue will lead to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anti-Defection Law, also known as the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, provides for the disqualification of legislators who voluntarily give up the membership of their party. This law aims to prevent floor-crossing and maintain the stability of governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mere absence from voting does not automatically lead to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.  The law primarily targets those who switch parties or vote against the party line. Absence from voting could be due to various reasons and is not considered a ground for disqualification in itself.


**26. Consider the following statements about the Committee on Public Undertakings:**

1. The Committee on Public Undertakings has more members from the Rajya Sabha than from the Lok Sabha.
2. The Chairperson of the Committee on Public Undertakings is appointed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

This ensures that the committee's work is overseen by an individual elected by the Lok Sabha and accountable to it.  The Speaker's role ensures the committee's independence and objectivity.


**27. With reference to the President's rule in a state, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President's rule (Article 356) often results in the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it does not automatically do so. The President can choose to keep the assembly functioning or dissolve it depending on the situation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The President's rule does not automatically lead to the suspension of Article 19 (right to freedom) in the affected state.  The suspension of fundamental rights is a separate process and requires specific grounds and procedures under the Constitution.


**28. Consider the following statements concerning the Ninth Schedule:**

1. The Parliament of India can place any law in the Ninth Schedule.
2. Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament has the power to add laws to the Ninth Schedule.  This power, however, has been subject to significant criticism, as it has been used to protect laws from judicial scrutiny, potentially undermining the principles of judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While laws initially placed in the Ninth Schedule were considered immune from judicial review, subsequent Supreme Court judgments have clarified that judicial review can still apply, particularly if the law violates fundamental rights.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Ninth Schedule does not provide absolute immunity from judicial review.


**29. With reference to the powers of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha can initiate a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister.
2. The Lok Sabha can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Lok Sabha, being the house of the people and the body to which the Council of Ministers is responsible, has the power to initiate a no-confidence motion against the government, including the Prime Minister. This is a fundamental aspect of parliamentary accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President, initiating the proceedings by passing a resolution with a special majority.  The Rajya Sabha then participates in the subsequent stages of the impeachment process.


**30. Consider the following statements about the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha.

**31. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature.
2. The Constitution mentions the term "Cabinet".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a bicameral legislature, comprising the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). This two-house system aims to provide checks and balances in the legislative process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Cabinet" is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution.  While the Constitution discusses the Council of Ministers and their relationship with the Parliament, it does not use the term "Cabinet" in a formal sense.  The term is used conventionally to refer to the key ministers who make important policy decisions.


**32. Consider the following statements about the financial provisions of the Indian Constitution:**

1. Article 112 deals with the annual financial statement.
2. Article 265 prohibits the imposition of a tax without the authority of law.

Statement 1 is correct. Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the annual financial statement (budget), outlining the procedures for its preparation and presentation to Parliament.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 265 prohibits the imposition of a tax without the authority of law. This underscores the importance of legislative sanction for taxation, preventing arbitrary levies by the executive branch and ensuring the people's representation in financial matters.




**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs aim to establish a socio-economic democracy by outlining the state's responsibilities towards social and economic justice.
2.  The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they are directly enforceable in courts of law.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are a set of guidelines enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution.  Their primary goal is to establish a socio-economic democracy by directing the state to work towards social and economic justice, welfare, and equality. They encompass various aspects like providing education, healthcare, and fair wages, promoting equal opportunities, and protecting weaker sections of society.  This aligns with the broader vision of a welfare state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable and enforceable in courts, the DPSPs are not directly enforceable.  They are considered as guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies and legislation.  While courts cannot directly compel the state to implement them, they can indirectly influence policy by interpreting constitutional provisions in light of the DPSPs.  The courts may strike down laws that are blatantly contradictory to the spirit of the DPSPs.  However, the DPSPs themselves do not provide for a direct remedy in case of non-compliance.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs is a deliberate constitutional choice, acknowledging the complexities of immediate implementation and the need for flexibility in addressing socio-economic issues.


**2. With reference to the Rajya Sabha's powers concerning financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to initiate Money Bills, and its approval is mandatory for their passage.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend or reject Money Bills passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money Bills, which deal primarily with financial matters like taxation, borrowing, and expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India, can *only* be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate Money Bills. While the Rajya Sabha can review and make recommendations on Money Bills, its approval is not mandatory for their passage. The Lok Sabha's decision on the Rajya Sabha's recommendations is final.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject Money Bills. It can only make recommendations to the Lok Sabha within 14 days of receiving the bill. The Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject these recommendations. The Lok Sabha's decision is final, and the bill is considered passed even if the Rajya Sabha rejects the Lok Sabha's decision. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced the principle of diarchy at both the central and provincial levels, separating legislative and executive powers.
2. The Act significantly expanded the powers of the Indian legislatures, granting them greater control over provincial finances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced the principle of diarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level, not at the central level.  At the provincial level, subjects were divided into "reserved" (under the Governor's control) and "transferred" (under the control of ministers responsible to the legislature) categories. The central government remained largely under the control of the British.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 1919 Act did expand the powers of the Indian legislatures, particularly at the provincial level. While diarchy limited the extent of self-governance, it did represent a step towards greater Indian participation in provincial administration and finance.  The transferred subjects gave Indian ministers some control over provincial budgets and certain administrative functions.


**4. With reference to the process of passing a bill in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A joint sitting requires a two-thirds majority of the total membership of both Houses for the bill's passage.
2.  In a joint sitting, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides and has the casting vote in case of a tie.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament is convened to resolve disagreements on a bill.  The bill's passage in a joint sitting requires only a simple majority of the members present and voting. This is not a two-thirds majority of the total membership of both Houses.

Statement 2 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting.  In case of a tie, the Speaker has a casting vote to break the deadlock and ensure the passage or rejection of the bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater weight in the joint sitting.


**5. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, shifting the focus from centralized planning to cooperative federalism.
2. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body, its establishment being mandated by the Constitution of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog was established in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission.  This shift reflected a move away from the centralized, command-and-control style of planning towards a more cooperative federalist approach. NITI Aayog aims to foster greater collaboration between the central government and the states in formulating and implementing development strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is not a constitutional body. It was established by a resolution of the government, not through a constitutional amendment. Its functions and structure are subject to changes based on government policy.  The Planning Commission, which it replaced, also lacked constitutional backing.


**6. With reference to the powers and responsibilities of the Union Executive, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive power of the Union is vested in the Prime Minister, who exercises it directly or through subordinate officers.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the Civil Services Board, responsible for overseeing the administration of civil services.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President of India, not the Prime Minister. The President exercises this power either directly or through officers subordinate to him/her. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are responsible for advising the President in the exercise of this power.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the Civil Services Board.  This Board plays a crucial role in matters concerning the recruitment, promotion, and discipline of the All India Services.

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states other than Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in various states across the country.  It grants special powers to the Governor to protect the interests of these communities.  The states covered by the Sixth Schedule are excluded from the scope of the Fifth Schedule.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule provides a special administrative system for tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It enables the establishment of autonomous districts and regional councils with significant powers over local governance and resources. This special arrangement aims to protect the distinct cultural and administrative practices of these tribal communities.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget and the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing the Union Budget, which is then presented to Parliament.
2. No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a significant role in the Union Budget's preparation, it is not solely responsible.  The entire process involves various departments and ministries, including the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Expenditure, coordinating with the Finance Ministry.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary account of the Union government where all revenues received are credited.  No expenditure can be incurred from this fund without the explicit authorization of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary control over government spending.

1. The President of India is the constitutional head of state and, therefore, the ultimate custodian of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court of India, as the highest court of the land, plays a crucial role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India is the head of state and holds a symbolic role as the custodian of the Constitution.  The President's oath of office emphasizes the responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. However, the President's powers are largely exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, as the apex court, plays a vital role in interpreting the Constitution and ensuring its supremacy.  Through judicial review, the court can strike down laws or executive actions that violate the Constitution.  The court's decisions shape the understanding and application of constitutional provisions, thus acting as a guardian of the Constitution's principles and values.


**10. With reference to the recent declaration of a classical language status, consider the following statements:**

1. Odia was recently declared a classical language, recognizing its rich history and literary heritage.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Odia is one of the languages that has been declared a classical language by the Indian government.  This recognition highlights the language's ancient origins, significant literary traditions, and its continuing cultural importance.

Statement 2 is correct. The criteria for declaring a language as "classical" in India include its antiquity (at least 1500-2000 years of history), its significant contribution to the development of literature, and its influence on other languages.  The declaration is a matter of government policy and recognition of the cultural significance of the language.


**11. With reference to the Legislative Council in Indian States, consider the following statements:**

1. A State Legislative Council can be larger in size than half the size of the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The size of a State Legislative Council cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the State Legislative Assembly. This constitutional limit ensures that the Assembly retains its dominance in the state legislature.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor of a State nominates the Chairman of the Legislative Council from amongst its members. Although the Council is a part of the state legislature, the Governor's role in appointing the Chairman reflects the constitutional position of the Governor in the state's political system.


**12. With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution, outlining the fundamental objectives of Indian polity.
2.  This provision is a Fundamental Duty, legally binding on all Indian citizens.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The phrase "To secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" is part of the Preamble of the Constitution. The Preamble sets the overall goals and aims of the Indian state and its commitment to the unity and integrity of the nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While upholding the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India is a national aspiration reflected in the Preamble and implicitly in various constitutional provisions, it is not explicitly stated as a Fundamental Duty in Part IV-A of the Constitution. Fundamental Duties are moral obligations on citizens, not legally enforceable duties.


**13. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayati Raj system aims to ensure people's participation in development and democratic decentralization.
2.  The Panchayati Raj system primarily focuses on political accountability and financial mobilization, ensuring efficient resource management.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayati Raj system, a cornerstone of rural local governance in India, is designed to achieve several objectives.  Prominent among these are empowering local communities through participation in development initiatives and promoting democratic decentralization by bringing governance closer to the people.  This ensures that local needs and priorities are effectively addressed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While political accountability and financial mobilization are important aspects of the Panchayati Raj system, they are not the primary or sole focus. The system aims to achieve broader goals of local development, community empowerment, and participatory democracy.  Effective resource management is a means to achieve these larger objectives, not the end itself.


**14. With reference to the concept of a "Welfare State" in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The ideal of a Welfare State is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble of the Constitution, setting the tone for social justice.
2.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) provide the constitutional basis for the concept of a Welfare State, outlining the state's responsibilities towards social and economic welfare.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble reflects the overall ideals of the Indian Constitution, including social justice and equality, it does not explicitly mention the term "Welfare State."  The concept is implied in the broader goals of justice, liberty, and equality.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) form the constitutional foundation for the concept of a Welfare State in India.  These principles direct the state to undertake various measures to promote social and economic welfare, such as providing education, healthcare, and work opportunities, protecting vulnerable groups, and striving for a more equitable society.  The DPSPs, while not directly justiciable, guide the state's policies and legislation towards creating a welfare-oriented society.


**15. With reference to the parliamentary system of government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's parliamentary system is characterized by the direct election of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.
2. The Council of Ministers' collective responsibility to the Lok Sabha is a defining feature of India's parliamentary system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key element of India's parliamentary system is the direct election of the Lok Sabha members by the people. This ensures that the lower house directly represents the popular will.  The Rajya Sabha, on the other hand, is indirectly elected.

Statement 2 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha is central to India's parliamentary democracy.  This means that the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha.  If the Lok Sabha expresses a lack of confidence in the government, it must resign.  This mechanism ensures the government's responsiveness to the legislature and the people.


**16. With reference to the lapse of bills pending in Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses automatically upon the prorogation of the session.
2. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses automatically when the session is prorogued (officially adjourned).  To continue its consideration, the bill needs to be reintroduced in the next session.

Statement 2 is correct. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not yet been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  This is because the Rajya Sabha is a continuing body, not subject to dissolution like the Lok Sabha. The bill can be carried over to the next Lok Sabha.


**17. With reference to the appointment and tenure of the Chief Secretary in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary.
2. The Chief Secretary in a State has a fixed tenure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State appoints the Chief Secretary, the highest-ranking civil servant in the state's administrative structure. However, this appointment is typically made on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure.  The appointment is typically for a period of 2-3 years, but it is subject to renewal or termination based on the state government's discretion. The Chief Secretary serves at the pleasure of the state government.


**18. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas can hear only civil cases and not criminal cases.
2. The Gram Nyayalayas Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act allows Gram Nyayalayas to hear both civil and criminal cases, subject to certain jurisdictional limits. The aim is to provide accessible and speedy justice at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act recognizes the importance of local participation in dispute resolution. It allows for the involvement of local social activists or panchayat members as mediators or conciliators in an attempt to settle disputes amicably before they escalate into formal court proceedings.  This reflects the Act's focus on promoting amicable dispute resolution mechanisms.


**19. With reference to the circumstances under which Parliament can legislate on a subject in the State List, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Lok Sabha with a simple majority.
2. The resolution must be passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 249 of the Indian Constitution allows Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest.  A simple majority in the Lok Sabha is not sufficient. The initiation and resolution-passing must happen in the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha resolution under Article 249 requires a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting. This reflects the higher threshold required for overriding the normal federal distribution of legislative powers.


**20. With reference to the minimum age and tenure of Panchayat members, consider the following statements:**

1. The minimum age prescribed for any person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years.
2. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues for the remaining period of its original term.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for a person to be a member of a Panchayat is 21 years, not 25 years as stated. This is outlined in the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.

Statement 2 is correct.  If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, the newly constituted Panchayat serves only for the remaining period of its original term.  This ensures that the normal term of the Panchayat is maintained, preventing unduly long or short tenures.


**21. With reference to the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposals focused primarily on social reforms, aiming to address issues like child marriage and untouchability.
2. The proposals introduced significant constitutional reforms, including the devolution of greater powers to Indian legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals of 1918 were primarily concerned with constitutional reforms, not social reforms. While the proposals indirectly touched upon social issues, their core focus was on restructuring the Indian government and governance structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals led to the Government of India Act of 1919, which introduced significant constitutional changes, including the introduction of diarchy at the provincial level, expansion of legislative councils, and some devolution of powers to Indian legislatures.


**22. With reference to the objectives embodied in the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble explicitly mentions economic liberty as one of the fundamental objectives.
2. The Preamble emphasizes liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship as essential objectives.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to secure social, economic, and political justice, it doesn't explicitly mention "economic liberty" as a separate objective. The focus is on securing justice and opportunity, which encompasses economic aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble explicitly guarantees liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship. These freedoms are considered fundamental to individual autonomy and are reflected in various fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.


**23. With reference to the Right against Exploitation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right against Exploitation includes the abolition of untouchability and the protection of the interests of minorities.
2. The Right against Exploitation prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labor, as well as the employment of children in hazardous work.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Constitution addresses untouchability (Article 17) and minority rights (Articles 29 and 30), these are separate fundamental rights, not specifically part of the Right against Exploitation (Article 23 and 24).

Statement 2 is correct.  The Right against Exploitation explicitly prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour (Article 23) and the employment of children in factories, mines, and other hazardous occupations (Article 24).


**24. With reference to the nature of Rights in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are claims of the State against its citizens, defining their obligations and duties.
2. Rights are claims of the citizens against the State, ensuring their freedoms and protections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rights are fundamentally claims of citizens *against* the State, not vice-versa.  They define the limits of state power and protect individual freedoms and liberties.  The State's obligations are defined in relation to the citizens' rights.

Statement 2 is correct. Rights are essential for individuals to enjoy freedoms and protections against state actions that could infringe upon their liberties.  They are the cornerstone of a just and democratic society.


**25. With reference to the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution provides a legislative process to enforce these duties.
2. Fundamental Duties are correlative to Fundamental Rights, implying reciprocal obligations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Duties, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not legally enforceable.  There is no specific legislative process to compel citizens to fulfill these duties.  They are primarily moral obligations, guiding citizens towards responsible citizenship.

Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Duties and Fundamental Rights are seen as correlatives; the enjoyment of rights entails certain responsibilities.  While not explicitly stated as legally binding, the relationship suggests that responsible exercise of rights is intertwined with fulfilling the corresponding duties.


**26. With reference to the relationship between Rights and Duties in the Indian context, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights and Duties are independent and unrelated concepts.
2.  Rights and Duties are interdependent and correlative, creating a balanced social order.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rights and duties are not separate but are intrinsically linked.  The enjoyment of rights comes with responsibilities towards society and the state.  A balanced social order depends on both individual rights and their corresponding civic duties.

Statement 2 is correct.  The concept of a just and equitable society rests on the interdependence of rights and duties.  Citizens have rights, but they also have corresponding obligations to uphold the law, respect others' rights, and contribute to the common good.


**27. With reference to the addition to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the 42nd Amendment, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of "Equal pay for equal work for both men and women."
2. The 42nd Amendment included the principle of "Participation of workers in management of industries."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution incorporated several significant changes, including the addition of the principle of "Equal pay for equal work for both men and women" to the Directive Principles of State Policy. This aimed to promote gender equality in the workplace.

Statement 2 is correct. The 42nd Amendment also added the principle of "Participation of workers in the management of industries" to the DPSPs. This aimed to increase worker participation in decision-making processes within industries and promote industrial democracy.


**28. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy as limitations on government functions, consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs constitute limitations on the legislative function of the government, guiding the enactment of laws.
2. DPSPs constitute limitations on the executive function of the government, influencing policy-making and administration.

**Which of the above statements is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) serve as guidelines for the legislature in enacting laws.  While not directly enforceable, they influence the legislative process, encouraging the enactment of laws that align with the principles of social and economic justice.  Laws that are contrary to the spirit of the DPSPs may face judicial scrutiny.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs also act as limitations on the executive function of the government. They guide policy-making and administrative actions, encouraging the executive to pursue policies that promote social and economic welfare.  Judicial review can indirectly influence executive actions by interpreting relevant constitutional provisions in light of the DPSPs.


**29. With reference to the eligibility for filing a nomination paper for election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only a citizen of India whose name appears on the electoral roll of a constituency can file a nomination.
2. Any citizen of India, regardless of residence, can file a nomination paper.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. To contest the Lok Sabha elections, a candidate must be a citizen of India and their name must be included in the electoral roll of the constituency where they are contesting.  This ensures that candidates are eligible voters within the constituency they represent.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While citizenship is a requirement, simply being an Indian citizen is not enough.  The candidate must also meet the criteria of being a registered voter in the constituency.  This requirement is essential for ensuring local representation.


**30. With reference to the election for the Lok Sabha or State Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. To be declared elected, the winning candidate must secure at least 50 percent of the votes polled.
2. The Constitution mandates that in the Lok Sabha, the Speaker's post goes to the majority party, and the Deputy Speaker's post to the opposition.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the first-past-the-post system used in India for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections, a candidate is declared elected if they secure the highest number of votes in the constituency, not necessarily 50 percent of the total votes polled.  A simple plurality is sufficient for victory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does not mandate the allocation of the Speaker's and Deputy Speaker's posts based on party affiliation. While convention often dictates that the majority party gets the Speaker's post, there's no constitutional requirement. The election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker are decided by the Lok Sabha itself.


**31. With reference to the Right to vote and to be elected in India, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a Fundamental Right, guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
2. It is a Constitutional Right, derived from the provisions of the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to vote and to be elected is not a Fundamental Right in India.  While it's a cornerstone of democracy, it's not included in the list of Fundamental Rights in Part III of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The right to vote and to be elected is a Constitutional Right, derived from the provisions of the Constitution that establish the electoral system and the franchise.  These provisions are essential for the functioning of a democratic republic.


**32. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a five-member body, ensuring broad representation.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections.
3. The Election Commission resolves disputes related to splits or mergers of recognized political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is a *single* entity, not a five-member body.  It's headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, with other Election Commissioners appointed as needed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of

**1. With reference to the powers and functions of the Vice-President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha and can only be removed from office by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.
2.  In the event of the death of the President, the Vice-President assumes the office of President for the remainder of the unexpired term.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vice-President does preside over the Rajya Sabha, their removal from office is solely the prerogative of the Rajya Sabha. A resolution for their removal can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and requires a special majority. The Lok Sabha's role is limited to concurring with the Rajya Sabha's decision.  The process doesn't involve a joint sitting of both Houses. This highlights a key difference in the removal process compared to the President.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 65 of the Constitution explicitly states that in the event of the President's death, the Vice-President assumes the office of President for the remainder of the unexpired term. This demonstrates the Vice-President's crucial role in presidential succession and ensures continuity of the highest office.  The Vice-President acts as a crucial safeguard against a power vacuum in such a scenario.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, meaning a vote of no confidence passed by the Lok Sabha can lead to the resignation of the entire Council.
2. The Attorney General of India is a member of the Council of Ministers and has the right to participate in its meetings but not to vote.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy in India.  The Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, is accountable to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, which represents the people's will. A vote of no confidence successfully passed in the Lok Sabha forces the resignation of the entire Council, reflecting the people's mandate.  This mechanism ensures governmental accountability and prevents executive overreach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General of India is the highest legal officer of the country, advising the government on legal matters. However, they are not a member of the Council of Ministers. While they have the right to participate in Parliament and its committees, their role is advisory, not executive. They do not hold a cabinet position and therefore do not participate in cabinet meetings.


**3. With reference to the President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can pardon any person convicted of an offence under any law, including those sentenced by a military court, but this power is subject to certain limitations.
2. The President's power to promulgate ordinances is a check on the legislative power of Parliament, allowing the executive to enact laws during parliamentary recesses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 72 of the Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. While this power is extensive, it is not absolute.  The President usually acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  Further, the President cannot pardon someone convicted by a state legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President's power to promulgate ordinances under Article 123 allows the executive to make laws when Parliament is not in session.  This power is temporary, as ordinances must be approved by Parliament within six weeks of its reassembly. This power is a vital tool for dealing with urgent matters requiring immediate legislative action, but it is crucial that it is not abused.  The use of ordinances is often a subject of debate, with concerns about bypassing the legislative process.


**4. With reference to the composition and powers of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha, representing the States, has equal legislative powers with the Lok Sabha on all matters except money bills.
2.  The President can address either House of Parliament, but this is usually done at the beginning of a session and on special occasions.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, represents the states and provides a federal balance.  While the Lok Sabha holds primary power over money bills (bills related to taxation and government spending), both houses have equal legislative powers on all other matters.  A bill must be passed by both houses to become law.  This arrangement reflects the balance of power between the federal and national levels of government.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The President of India, as the head of state, has the constitutional power to address either House of Parliament.  While not a frequent occurrence in day-to-day parliamentary proceedings, it is a significant event often marking the beginning of a session, or used for delivering important addresses to the nation. This underscores the President's role as the head of state and their involvement in the legislative process.


**5. Consider the following statements relating to the Parliament's legislative procedure:**

1. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.
2.  A joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament is convened by the President only when there is a disagreement between the two Houses on a non-money bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Money bills, concerning matters of taxation and government spending, are exclusively introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can review and suggest amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final say.  This reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected lower house.  The Rajya Sabha's role is to scrutinize and offer suggestions, maintaining a balance of power.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament is a constitutional provision designed to resolve deadlocks between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. However, this mechanism is only applicable to non-money bills.  The President convenes the joint sitting, and the Lok Sabha's decision prevails in the joint sitting.  This process underscores the ultimate authority of the lower house in legislative matters.


**6. With reference to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from among its members and holds office until the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Speaker presides over the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament and has the power to cast a deciding vote in case of a tie.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha itself from amongst its members.  They hold office until the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, unless removed earlier through a resolution passed by a majority of the members. This process emphasizes the House's control over its own presiding officer.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Speaker presides over the Lok Sabha, it is the Deputy Speaker who presides over a joint sitting of both Houses if the Speaker is absent.  The Speaker, like other presiding officers, does have a casting vote in case of a tie in the Lok Sabha, but this power does not extend to joint sittings.  The rules of precedence within the Houses and joint sittings are distinct.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President and holds office until the age of 65.
2.  The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments and submits audit reports to the President, who then presents them to Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a fixed term or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. This ensures their independence from political influence and allows for a consistent approach to auditing government accounts. The fixed tenure protects the CAG from political interference, safeguarding the integrity of the audit process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A crucial aspect of the CAG's role is the auditing of the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then presents them to Parliament. This ensures transparency and accountability in public finance management.  The reports are then examined by the Public Accounts Committee, which further scrutinizes government spending.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Public Accounts Committee (PAC):**

1. The PAC is a parliamentary committee that examines the audit reports of the CAG and scrutinizes government expenditure.
2. The PAC consists of members from both Houses of Parliament, with a majority from the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PAC is a crucial parliamentary committee responsible for examining the audit reports submitted by the CAG.  It scrutinizes government spending, ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of public funds. This committee plays a vital role in parliamentary oversight of government finances.

Statement 2 is also correct. The PAC is composed of members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. However, the majority of its members are drawn from the Lok Sabha, reflecting the lower house's greater representation of the people's will.  The composition of the PAC ensures that both houses are involved in scrutinizing government expenditure.


**9. With reference to the Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1. Union Territories are administered by the President through an administrator, who may be a Lieutenant Governor or a Chief Commissioner.
2.  Union Territories with a Legislative Assembly have a Council of Ministers responsible to the Assembly, similar to States.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Union Territories, unlike States, are directly administered by the President of India.  The President appoints an administrator, who could be a Lieutenant Governor or a Chief Commissioner, to oversee the administration of the Union Territory.  This reflects the Centre's greater control over Union Territories compared to States.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Some Union Territories have been granted a Legislative Assembly.  In such cases, a Council of Ministers is formed, and it is responsible to the Legislative Assembly.  This mimics the structure of State Governments, providing a degree of self-governance within the Union Territory.  However, the ultimate authority still rests with the central government.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, though this is rarely done. This arrangement ensures the Governor remains accountable to the central government.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the Governor has several discretionary powers, the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly is generally exercised on the advice of the Chief Minister. This reflects the principle of responsible government at the state level.  However, there are certain exceptional circumstances where the Governor may exercise their discretion in dissolving the Assembly, such as when no party or coalition has a clear majority.


**11. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Right to Equality includes the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2. Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court or High Courts for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This is a crucial provision ensuring equal treatment for all citizens irrespective of their background.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 32 of the Constitution is a powerful safeguard, guaranteeing the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs (orders) to protect these rights.  This provision is considered the "heart and soul" of the Constitution, allowing individuals to seek judicial redress for violations of their fundamental rights.  High Courts also have similar powers under Article 226.


**12. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socialistic pattern of society, guiding the State towards socioeconomic justice.
2. These principles are not justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts of law.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, guide the State towards establishing a just and equitable society.  They aim to promote social and economic equality, aiming for a welfare state.  While not legally binding in the same way as Fundamental Rights, they serve as a moral compass for governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the State's policy-making, encouraging the government to work towards a socially just and economically equitable society.  However, the courts have, in certain cases, interpreted the Directive Principles to inform their decisions on Fundamental Rights, showing a degree of interaction between the two.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution:**

1. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Amendment to protect certain land reforms laws from judicial review.
2.  Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review, meaning courts cannot examine their constitutionality.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the First Amendment Act of 1951.  Its primary purpose was to protect certain laws enacted by the states, mainly those relating to land reforms, from judicial review.  This was done to ensure the smooth implementation of these vital social and economic reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially intended to shield laws from judicial scrutiny, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws included in the Ninth Schedule are not entirely immune from judicial review.  The Court can still examine the constitutionality of these laws if they violate basic fundamental rights or the principles of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has progressively restricted the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection.


**14. With reference to the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1. Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.
2.  The Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Fundamental Duties, outlined in Part IVA of the Constitution, are moral obligations for citizens, not legally enforceable rights. They aim to promote civic virtue and national unity.  While not justiciable, they are meant to guide the conduct of citizens and inspire a sense of national responsibility.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Fundamental Duties were introduced into the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  This amendment, along with other changes, aimed to update the Constitution to reflect the changing social and political landscape of India.  The addition of Fundamental Duties reflected a desire to emphasize civic responsibility and national integration.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India.
2.  The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President, and their tenure is fixed.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India is a crucial constitutional body established to ensure free and fair elections at all levels in the country.  Its independence from the executive branch is paramount to the integrity of the electoral process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.  Their tenure is fixed, providing them with security of tenure and protecting them from political influence.  This ensures the impartiality and independence of the Election Commission.  The fixed tenure protects them from political pressure and enables them to discharge their duties without fear or favor.


**16. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to various civil services of the Union.
2.  The UPSC's recommendations are binding on the government, meaning the government must accept the UPSC's choices for appointments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Constitution. Its primary responsibility is to conduct examinations and recruit candidates for various civil service positions in the Union Government. The UPSC plays a vital role in ensuring merit-based recruitment to the civil services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UPSC's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not binding on the government. The government can choose to reject the UPSC's recommendations, although this is rare and usually involves a detailed explanation. The government's final decision rests with the appropriate appointing authority, maintaining a balance of power between the executive and the independent commission.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President every five years to review the financial relations between the Union and the States.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the President to constitute a Finance Commission every five years to examine the financial resources of the Union and the States and recommend the distribution of tax revenues between them.  This crucial body plays a vital role in maintaining fiscal balance and equitable resource allocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and generally accepted, they are not legally binding on either the Union or State Governments.  The government can choose not to accept the recommendations, although this is unusual. The recommendations are usually accepted as they are vital for maintaining intergovernmental financial relations.


**18. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in India and has original jurisdiction in certain matters.
2.  The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, allowing it to declare laws or government actions unconstitutional.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country, the final court of appeal. It also has original jurisdiction in specific matters, as outlined in the Constitution, such as disputes between the Union and States or disputes between States.  This dual role underscores its position as the guardian of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A defining feature of the Indian judicial system is the power of judicial review. The Supreme Court can examine the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament or actions taken by the executive.  If found to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the Court can declare them void.  This power is fundamental to upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the High Courts in India:**

1. Each State has a High Court, which is the highest court within the State's jurisdiction.
2.  High Courts have the power to issue writs to protect fundamental rights and other legal rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While most States have their own High Courts, some States share a common High Court, and some Union Territories fall under the jurisdiction of a particular State's High Court.  The arrangement isn't uniform across all States and Territories.

Statement 2 is correct.  High Courts, as superior courts, play a vital role in upholding the rule of law.  They have the power to issue various writs (orders) to protect fundamental rights and other legal rights. This power is crucial for safeguarding individual liberties and ensuring accountability within the State's legal framework.  The writ jurisdiction of High Courts is a significant tool for judicial redress.


**20. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.
2. The Governor has the power to appoint the Chief Minister of the State, usually selecting the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State possesses certain discretionary powers, including the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.  This power is typically used for bills that raise significant constitutional or policy concerns.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor plays a crucial role in the formation of the State Government.  While usually acting on convention, they appoint the Chief Minister, typically choosing the leader of the party or coalition commanding a majority in the State Legislative Assembly.  The Governor's discretion is most relevant in situations where no single party or coalition has a clear majority.




**1. With reference to the functions of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The PAC examines the CAG's report on the appropriation accounts to ensure that funds voted by Parliament are spent within the approved limits.
2. The PAC examines the statement of accounts of state corporations and trading/manufacturing projects, excluding those already reviewed by the Committee on Public Undertakings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a crucial parliamentary committee that plays a vital role in overseeing public expenditure.  Statement 1 accurately reflects one of its core functions: scrutinizing the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG's) report on appropriation accounts.  The PAC ensures that the government has spent the funds allocated by Parliament legally and efficiently, within the parameters of the approved demands.  This is a key aspect of parliamentary control over public finances.

Statement 2 is also correct. The PAC's mandate extends to examining the accounts of various public entities, including state corporations and trading/manufacturing projects. However, to avoid duplication of effort, the PAC typically excludes those entities already under the purview of the Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU).  This division of labor ensures efficient oversight without unnecessary overlap.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of the PAC's responsibilities.


**2. With reference to the Governor's powers in a state, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor has the power to nominate members to the State Legislative Council.
2. The Governor's most significant legislative power lies in dissolving the State Legislative Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state holds a unique constitutional position, balancing executive, legislative, and discretionary powers. Statement 1 is correct; the Governor possesses the power to nominate a certain number of members to the State Legislative Council, if it exists. This is a significant power that allows the Governor to bring in individuals with expertise and experience to the legislative process.  The number of nominated members is usually a fraction of the total council membership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, this is an extreme measure usually taken under specific circumstances, such as a loss of confidence by the ruling government.  More routine and frequently exercised legislative powers of the Governor include assenting to bills passed by the state legislature and issuing ordinances when the legislature is not in session.  Therefore, the most significant power is not necessarily the power to dissolve the Assembly, but rather the power to assent to bills, effectively giving them the force of law.


**3. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a motion for the removal of the Vice-President.
2. The Lok Sabha alone has the power to vote on the demands for grants included in the Union Budget.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament comprises two houses – Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha – each with distinct powers and functions. Statement 1 is accurate; the Rajya Sabha holds the exclusive power to initiate the process of removing the Vice-President.  This reflects the Rajya Sabha's role in checks and balances within the Indian political system. A resolution for removal must be passed by a special majority in the Rajya Sabha, and subsequently, the Lok Sabha must agree to it by a simple majority.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lok Sabha, being the directly elected house, holds the sole authority to vote on the demands for grants forming part of the Union Budget. This reflects the democratic principle of financial accountability to the directly elected representatives of the people. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on the demands for grants. This power differential is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system's financial procedures.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Contingency Fund of India:**

1. The Contingency Fund of India is operated by the President of India.
2. The creation of the Contingency Fund of India diminishes parliamentary control over public expenditure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Contingency Fund of India serves as a reserve fund to meet unforeseen and urgent expenditures. Statement 1 is correct; the President of India operates this fund, drawing upon it when necessary.  The President acts on the advice of the Union government, but the ultimate authority to utilize the fund rests with the President.  This is a constitutional provision designed to ensure swift action in emergencies.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Contingency Fund is meant for exceptional circumstances, its existence can, to a degree, reduce parliamentary control over expenditure. Since funds are drawn from the Contingency Fund without prior parliamentary approval, it potentially diminishes the legislature's scrutiny of public spending.  However, Parliament subsequently ratifies the expenditure from the Contingency Fund, limiting the extent of this diminishment. The fund is intended to address urgent needs, but the post-facto ratification mechanism still subjects the usage to parliamentary oversight.


**5. With reference to the 73rd Amendment Act on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act makes the provision for reservation of seats for backward classes in Panchayats a mandatory requirement.
2. The Act confers financial powers on Panchayats concerning taxes, fees, and other financial resources.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, is a landmark piece of legislation that aimed at strengthening the Panchayati Raj system in India. Statement 1 is correct; the Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Panchayats. This provision is intended to promote social justice and inclusive governance at the grassroots level. The specific percentages of reservation are determined by state governments based on population proportions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A crucial aspect of the 73rd Amendment is the devolution of financial powers to Panchayats.  The Act empowers Panchayats to levy, collect, and appropriate certain taxes, fees, and tolls.  This financial autonomy is essential for their effective functioning and capacity to implement development programs.  The specific taxes and the extent of their authority are defined by state laws, ensuring a degree of flexibility tailored to local needs.


**6. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC's functions are solely derived from the provisions of the Constitution of India.
2. The President of India can exclude certain posts, services, and matters from the purview of UPSC consultation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is a crucial constitutional body responsible for recruitment to various civil services in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Constitution does lay out the foundational roles of the UPSC, the scope of its functions has also been expanded through subsequent legislation and executive orders.  The UPSC's involvement in various aspects of personnel management extends beyond the explicit constitutional mandates.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution empowers the President to exclude certain posts, services, and matters from the scope of consultation with the UPSC. This is a provision that allows the government to maintain flexibility in handling specific personnel matters, particularly those that may require exceptional or confidential procedures. This power is exercised judiciously and doesn't undermine the UPSC's overall role in ensuring merit-based appointments.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is solely accountable to the Parliament of India.
2. The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of State Governments.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments. Statement 1 is correct; the CAG is constitutionally independent and directly accountable to the Parliament. This independence ensures impartiality and objectivity in auditing government accounts.  The CAG submits its reports to Parliament, allowing for effective oversight of public funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State governments, it doesn't compile and maintain these accounts.  The respective governments are responsible for maintaining their own accounts; the CAG's role is to audit these accounts to ensure their accuracy, legality, and efficiency.  The CAG's reports highlight discrepancies and irregularities, providing valuable insights for parliamentary scrutiny.


**8.  With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.
2. The Finance Commission's composition includes a Chairman and four other members.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is a constitutional body established to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight and influence, they are not legally binding on the Union and State governments.  The government is free to accept or reject the recommendations, but it usually considers them carefully due to their importance in fiscal federalism.  However, the government is obligated to lay the report before Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution specifies the composition of the Finance Commission as consisting of a Chairman and four other members.  The President appoints these members based on their expertise in finance, economics, and related fields. The selection process ensures the commission's expertise and impartiality in its crucial role in resource allocation.


**9. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anti-Defection Law is incorporated in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India.
2. The Presiding Officer of the House has the power to decide on matters related to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anti-Defection Law, aimed at curbing the practice of legislators switching parties for personal gain, is a crucial aspect of India's political system. Statement 1 is correct; the law is constitutionally enshrined in the Tenth Schedule.  This constitutional status reflects the importance of maintaining political stability and preventing disruptions caused by frequent party-switching.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Presiding Officer of the House (Speaker of Lok Sabha or Chairman of Rajya Sabha) has the authority to decide on matters related to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.  This is a significant power that allows the presiding officer to ensure the integrity of the legislative process.  While the decision of the presiding officer is subject to judicial review, it is the initial arbiter in these cases.


**10. With reference to the powers of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights.
2. Parliament can make laws on any subject in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament of India possesses extensive legislative powers, including the ability to amend the Constitution.  Statement 1 is correct; Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights. This power, however, is subject to certain procedural requirements, including the need for special majorities.  The Supreme Court can review the validity of constitutional amendments, ensuring that they don't violate the basic structure of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Constitution grants Parliament the power to legislate on subjects in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is in the national interest.  This provision recognizes the need for national-level action in matters that may have implications beyond individual states.  This power is intended to be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India is empowered to authorise the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India only after obtaining the approval of the Parliament.
2.  The expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India is not subject to the vote of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Union Budget, which must be presented to Parliament annually.  No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India except under the authority of Parliament. This means that the President can only authorize withdrawals after parliamentary approval through the appropriation bill.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Certain expenditures are termed "charged" upon the Consolidated Fund.  These are typically obligatory payments like salaries of the President, judges, etc., and they don't require the annual vote of Parliament.  They are automatically charged to the Consolidated Fund of India.  While Parliament exercises control over the overall budget, these specific charged expenditures are outside the scope of their vote.  This ensures that essential constitutional functions are unaffected by the annual budgetary process.  The distinction between "charged" and "voted" expenditure is crucial in understanding the budgetary system's workings.


**2. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2. The Finance Commission is constituted every five years and submits its report to the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight and are generally accepted, they are not legally binding on the Union or State Governments. The government can choose to accept or reject the recommendations, but it is expected to justify its decisions.  The non-binding nature allows for flexibility in response to changing economic conditions and political priorities.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 280 of the Indian Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years. This commission is tasked with making recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States, principles for grants-in-aid, and other related financial matters. The commission then presents its report to the President.  The five-year cycle ensures regular review of the fiscal arrangements and addresses evolving needs.


**3. With reference to the President's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can promulgate an ordinance even when Parliament is in session.
2. An ordinance issued by the President ceases to operate six months from its promulgation.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 123 of the Constitution grants the President the power to promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  This is intended to address urgent legislative needs during parliamentary recess. The power is, however, exceptional and not meant to be used routinely when Parliament is functioning.

Statement 2 is correct but requires clarification.  An ordinance issued by the President under Article 123 remains in effect for six months from the date of its promulgation.  However, this period can be extended for another six months if Parliament is not in session.  If Parliament is in session, the ordinance lapses at the end of the session unless it has been approved by Parliament.  The six-month limit is a critical safeguard against the executive overstepping its legislative authority.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced provincial autonomy in India.
2. It established a bicameral legislature at the Centre.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, a landmark legislation in the British Indian context, introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy.  It devolved substantial legislative and administrative powers to the provinces, marking a crucial step towards self-governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the Centre, consisting of a Federal Legislative Assembly (Lower House) and a Council of State (Upper House). This bicameral structure was a key feature of the federal scheme envisioned by the Act, reflecting a more complex and nuanced approach to governance.  The bicameral setup aimed to balance the interests of different regions and groups within the Indian polity.


**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 148 of the Indian Constitution outlines the appointment and tenure of the CAG.  The President appoints the CAG for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. This provision ensures that the CAG enjoys a reasonable degree of independence and security of tenure, essential for performing its vital auditing function without undue political influence.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  After completing the audit, the CAG submits its reports to the President, who then presents them to Parliament.  This ensures that Parliament is informed about the financial management of public funds and can hold the government accountable.  The presentation of reports to Parliament is crucial to the CAG's role in promoting transparency and accountability.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable in nature and enforceable by courts.
2. They aim to create a welfare state in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are not justiciable.  This means that they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards achieving social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights. The non-justiciable nature reflects the balancing act between individual rights and social goals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs represent the socio-economic goals of the Indian Constitution. They aim to establish a welfare state that ensures social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens.  They are aspirational in nature, guiding the government towards a more equitable and just society.  The principles reflect the values of social justice and welfare that underpin the Indian Constitution.


**7. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a quasi-federal system, combining elements of both federal and unitary systems.
2. The system of single citizenship in India strengthens the federal structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution is often described as establishing a quasi-federal or federal system with a centralising tendency. It combines features of both federal and unitary systems. While it demarcates powers between the Union and States, the Union Government has significant powers, including the ability to legislate on subjects in the State List under certain circumstances.  The distribution of powers is not strictly equal, leading to the quasi-federal characterisation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The system of single citizenship in India, where all citizens are citizens of India and not of individual states, actually weakens the federal structure.  It reduces the autonomy of the states in certain matters and reinforces the Union's dominance.  A federal system usually entails dual citizenship, at the national and state level, which is not the case in India.


**8. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2. One-third of the members of the Rajya Sabha retire every two years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  It can only make recommendations within 14 days, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is crucial to the parliamentary system's functioning.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role in financial legislation prevents it from obstructing crucial financial measures.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 83 of the Indian Constitution specifies that one-third of the Rajya Sabha members retire every two years.  This ensures a gradual turnover of membership, bringing in fresh perspectives while maintaining continuity.  The staggered retirement system helps maintain a balance between stability and renewal within the Upper House.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws is guaranteed under Article 14.
2.  The right to freedom of speech and expression is absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.  This is a cornerstone of the Indian legal system, ensuring that all individuals are treated equally under the law, regardless of their status or background.  The principle of equality is fundamental to a just and equitable society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 19 guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, it is not absolute.  The Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of public order, security, morality, and other legitimate concerns.  The limitations are essential to balance individual freedom with the needs of society as a whole.  The concept of reasonable restrictions is central to the interpretation of fundamental rights.


**10. With reference to the  All India Services, consider the following statements:**

1. All India Services officers are appointed by the respective State Governments.
2. The President of India can make regulations for the All India Services.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. All India Services (AIS) officers, such as the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS), are appointed by the President of India on the recommendations of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).  The President's role highlights the national character of these services and ensures consistent standards across states. State governments do not have the power to appoint these officers.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 309 of the Constitution grants the President the power to make regulations for the recruitment and service conditions of AIS officers.  This power allows the central government to maintain consistent standards and guidelines for AIS officers across the country.  The President's power reflects the Union's role in overseeing the functioning of these services.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 155 of the Indian Constitution states that the Governor of a state shall be appointed by the President. The President's role signifies the Union's role in the appointment of state governors.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 156 of the Constitution specifies that the Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This implies that the President can remove the Governor at any time without assigning any reason.  While the Governor enjoys a degree of independence, the President's power to remove them is a crucial mechanism for maintaining overall national unity and coordination.


**12. With reference to the  NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of NITI Aayog.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog was established in 2015, replacing the Planning Commission.  The change reflected a shift in the approach to economic planning from a centralized, command-and-control model to a more cooperative and participatory one.  NITI Aayog aims to foster greater collaboration between the Centre and States in the planning process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of NITI Aayog. This emphasizes the importance given to economic planning and ensures the organization's alignment with the overall national policy framework.  The Prime Minister's leadership ensures the organization's focus on national priorities.


**13. With reference to the  Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for the establishment of Gram Sabhas in rural areas.
2.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates that one-third of the seats in Panchayats at all levels be reserved for women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 introduced Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats, and mandated the establishment of Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) as the cornerstone of rural local self-governance.  The Gram Sabha is a crucial element of the Panchayati Raj system, promoting local participation and decision-making.

Statement 2 is also correct. The same amendment also mandates that one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats at all three levels (village, intermediate, and district) be reserved for women.  This provision aims to enhance women's participation in local governance and address gender inequality.  The reservation of seats is a significant step towards empowering women in rural India.


**14. With reference to the  Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures only.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  While it used to be a multi-member body, the current structure ensures greater efficiency and decision-making authority.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The ECI is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and also to the President and Vice-President of India.  It also plays a crucial role in regulating political parties and ensuring free and fair elections.  The ECI's responsibilities extend beyond just parliamentary and state legislative elections.


**15. With reference to the  Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can review its own judgments.
2. The Supreme Court of India can issue writs only to government officials and not to private individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, including the power to review its own judgments. This power is inherent in the Court's role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.  The power of judicial review allows the court to correct its errors and adapt its jurisprudence to evolving societal needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court can issue writs (such as habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto) to both government officials and private individuals. The power to issue writs is a vital tool for protecting fundamental rights and ensuring the rule of law.  The reach of the Supreme Court's writ jurisdiction extends to both public and private entities.


**1. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  They aim to establish a welfare state by ensuring social and economic justice.
2.  They are justiciable and enforceable in courts of law like Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are guidelines for the state to achieve a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice. They aim to create a society based on equality, liberty, and fraternity.  They are inspired by the Irish Constitution and aim to create a social and economic base for democracy.  However, unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not directly enforceable by courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable in courts.  While they guide the government's policies and actions, they do not confer any enforceable rights on individuals.  The courts can't compel the state to implement them. The difference between DPSP and Fundamental Rights lies in their enforceability. Fundamental Rights are enforceable in the court of law while DPSPs are not.


**2. Consider the following statements about Money Bills:**

1.  They can only be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  This is a crucial aspect of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and recommending amendments, but it cannot initiate or reject a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only suggest amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill from the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject these suggestions. The Rajya Sabha's power in this regard is purely recommendatory, not decisive.  The Lok Sabha's decision is final.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1.  It clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2.  It established a system of dyarchy at the center, dividing power between Indian and British executives.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature. The Act primarily focused on expanding legislative councils and introducing limited self-government at the provincial level.  The clear demarcation of powers among the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) was not a central feature of this Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act 1919 introduced dyarchy at the provincial level, not at the center. Dyarchy meant a division of power between Indian ministers responsible to the legislature and British executive officials. The central government remained under the complete control of the British.


**4. Consider the following statements about joint sittings of Parliament:**

1.  A joint sitting can be convened to resolve a deadlock over a Money Bill.
2.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A joint sitting of Parliament cannot be called to resolve a deadlock over a Money Bill.  In the case of a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha's decision is final. The Rajya Sabha can only offer recommendations, and the Lok Sabha has the ultimate authority. A joint sitting is only applicable to ordinary bills and financial bills (excluding Money Bills and Constitutional Amendment Bills).

Statement 2 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of Parliament. If the Speaker is absent, the Deputy Speaker presides, followed by the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and finally, a member chosen by those present. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha does not preside because they are not a member of either House.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1.  It replaced the Planning Commission.
2.  It is headed by the President of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) replaced the Planning Commission of India in 2015.  The shift aimed to move away from a centrally planned economy to a more cooperative federalist model, emphasizing collaborative policy-making with states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is not headed by the President of India.  It is headed by the Prime Minister of India, who is also the ex-officio chairman. The Vice-Chairperson is appointed by the Prime Minister.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution:**

1.  The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.
2.  The Sixth Schedule provides for the administration of tribal areas in four northeastern states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.  It details the powers of the Governor and the role of the tribal advisory councils in these areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides for the administration of tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils with significant powers over local governance and administration. The Sixth Schedule is a unique feature of the Indian Constitution, aiming to protect the unique cultural and administrative structures of tribal communities in the Northeast.


**7. With reference to the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Revenue prepares the Union Budget.
2.  Parliament's authorization is required for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in preparing the Union Budget. It is primarily responsible for formulating tax policies and managing government revenue.  While other departments contribute to expenditure estimates, the Department of Revenue is central to the revenue side of the budget.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 112 of the Indian Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This ensures parliamentary control over government spending and prevents unauthorized withdrawals.  This is a cornerstone of financial accountability in the Indian system.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India is the custodian of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court of India interprets the Constitution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India, as the head of state, is considered the custodian of the Constitution. This symbolic role reflects the President's duty to uphold the Constitution and its principles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India plays a vital role in interpreting the Constitution.  Its judicial review power allows it to determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.  Through its judgements, the Supreme Court shapes the understanding and application of the Constitution.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Legislative Council of a State:**

1.  It can be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly.
2.  The Governor nominates its Chairman.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A State Legislative Council cannot be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly.  The Constitution sets a maximum limit of one-third of the Assembly's size for the Council. This ensures that the Assembly, the directly elected body, retains its dominance in the state legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor does not nominate the Chairman of the Legislative Council. The Chairman is elected by the members of the Council from amongst themselves.  While the Governor plays a role in appointing the members of the Council, the Chairman's position is determined through an internal election within the Council.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Preamble of the Constitution contains the ideal of a "Welfare State."
2.  The Directive Principles of State Policy enshrine the ideal of a "Welfare State."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Preamble reflects the ideals of social and economic justice, it does not explicitly mention the term "Welfare State."  The Preamble outlines the objectives of the Constitution, including securing social, economic, and political justice, but does not define a specific model of governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Part IV of the Constitution explicitly aim to establish a "Welfare State."  The DPSPs provide guidelines for the state to promote social welfare, economic development, and social justice, which are core tenets of a welfare state.  They guide the state's policies towards ensuring a minimum standard of living and providing social security.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses on its prorogation.
2. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse on dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha does *not* lapse on its prorogation. Prorogation is the termination of a session of Parliament, and bills pending at the time of prorogation are carried over to the next session.  Only dissolution of the Lok Sabha causes a bill to lapse.

Statement 2 is correct. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that hasn't been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  This is because the Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and amend bills; the Lok Sabha's approval is crucial for a bill to become law.  Dissolution of the Lok Sabha doesn't affect bills that haven't yet received Lok Sabha approval.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Chief Secretary of a State:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Secretary.
2. The Chief Secretary has a fixed tenure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor is the constitutional head of the state, the appointment of the Chief Secretary is not directly made by the Governor.  The Chief Secretary is the senior-most civil servant in the state, and their appointment is usually made by the state government on the advice of the Chief Minister.  The Governor's role is largely ceremonial in this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chief Secretary of a state does not have a fixed tenure.  Their tenure is at the pleasure of the state government,  meaning they can be transferred or removed at any time.  This is because the Chief Secretary is a civil servant serving under the state government, and their position is not protected by any fixed term.


**13. With reference to the Gram Nyayalaya Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas can hear only civil cases.
2. The Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) can hear both civil and criminal cases.  They are intended to provide accessible and affordable justice at the village level, dealing with local disputes efficiently.  Their jurisdiction covers a range of cases, not just civil matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Nyayalaya Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators.  This is aimed at promoting amicable settlements and reducing the burden on the formal judicial system.  The Act recognizes the importance of community involvement in resolving local disputes.


**14.  Consider the following statements about the Parliament's power to legislate on State List subjects:**

1. The Lok Sabha must pass a resolution by a simple majority.
2. The Rajya Sabha must pass a resolution by a two-thirds majority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List in the national interest if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha, not the Lok Sabha, by a two-thirds majority. The Lok Sabha has no role in initiating this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a resolution is required from the Rajya Sabha, it must be passed by a two-thirds majority of members *present and voting*, not a two-thirds majority of the total membership. This is a crucial distinction that highlights the specific threshold required for the Rajya Sabha to grant the Parliament this extraordinary power.


**15. Consider the following statements about Panchayats:**

1. The minimum age for a Panchayat member is 25 years.
2. A reconstituted Panchayat after premature dissolution serves only for the remaining term.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is not uniformly 25 years across all states.  While the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides a framework for Panchayats, the specific age limit can vary based on state laws.  Some states may have lower age limits.

Statement 2 is correct.  If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, the reconstituted Panchayat serves only for the remainder of the original term.  It does not get a fresh five-year term. This ensures the continuity of the Panchayat system and prevents prolonged periods of uncertainty in local governance.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals:**

1. They focused primarily on social reforms.
2. They introduced the principle of dyarchy at the provincial level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals were primarily concerned with constitutional reforms, not social reforms.  While the proposals did touch upon some aspects of social life, their core focus was on reforming the governance structure of India.  Social reform was a separate agenda pursued by various social and political organizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, which formed the basis of the Government of India Act 1919, introduced the principle of dyarchy at the provincial level. This involved a division of powers between Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures and British executive officials.  Dyarchy was a significant step towards limited self-government in India, but it was ultimately a flawed system due to the unequal distribution of power.


**17. With reference to the Preamble to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. It explicitly mentions economic liberty.
2. It guarantees liberty of belief.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution does not explicitly mention "economic liberty" as a guaranteed right.  While it aims to secure social, economic, and political justice, the specific term "economic liberty" is not used. The Preamble focuses on the broader goals of the Constitution, including justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble guarantees "liberty of belief," as part of its broader commitment to liberty.  This reflects the Constitution's commitment to religious freedom and the right of individuals to hold and practice their beliefs without undue state interference.  The liberty mentioned in the preamble encompasses various freedoms, including freedom of conscience, religion, and belief.


**18.  Consider the following statements concerning the Right against Exploitation:**

1. It includes the abolition of untouchability.
2. It prohibits the employment of children in factories.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the abolition of untouchability is a significant aspect of social justice, it is primarily addressed under Article 17, which deals with the abolition of untouchability and its practice. It is not directly part of the Right against Exploitation. The Right against Exploitation focuses on economic exploitation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Right against Exploitation, under Articles 23 and 24, specifically prohibits the employment of children in factories and other hazardous work.  This is a crucial provision aimed at protecting children from economic exploitation and ensuring their well-being. Article 24 explicitly prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in any factory or mine or other hazardous work.


**19. Consider the following statements about Fundamental Duties:**

1. There is a legislative process to enforce these duties.
2. They are correlative to Fundamental Rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. There is no specific legislative process to enforce Fundamental Duties. Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable, Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable. While they are important moral obligations, there is no legal mechanism to compel citizens to fulfill them.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Fundamental Duties and Fundamental Rights are interconnected and complement each other, they are not strictly "correlative" in a legal sense.  Fundamental Rights define the limits of state power and protect individual freedoms, while Fundamental Duties are moral obligations of citizens.  There is no direct legal reciprocal relationship between the two.


**20.  Consider the following statements about the relationship between Rights and Duties in India:**

1. Rights are claims of citizens against the state.
2. Duties are important for the stability of the state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a democratic society, rights are claims that citizens have against the state.  These rights are protected by the Constitution and the legal system, ensuring that the state respects individual freedoms and doesn't infringe upon them arbitrarily.

Statement 2 is correct.  Duties are essential for the stability and proper functioning of the state.  When citizens fulfill their duties, it contributes to the stability and strength of the democratic system.   Citizens' responsibilities, such as respecting the law, participating in civic processes, and respecting the rights of others, are crucial for maintaining a stable and orderly society.


**21. Consider the following statements about the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution:**

1. It added the principle of "equal pay for equal work" to the Directive Principles of State Policy.
2. It made the Directive Principles of State Policy justiciable.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution of India, enacted in 1976, added the principle of "equal pay for equal work for both men and women" to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP).  This amendment reflected the growing emphasis on gender equality and fair labor practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 42nd Amendment did *not* make the Directive Principles of State Policy justiciable.  The DPSPs remain non-justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts. The amendment primarily aimed to strengthen the fundamental structure of the Constitution and make certain provisions more effective, but did not change the non-justiciable nature of DPSPs.


**22. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. They constitute limitations upon legislative function.
2. They constitute limitations upon executive function.

**Which of the above statements is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) act as guidelines for the legislature in framing laws. While not directly enforceable, they influence the legislative process by encouraging lawmakers to consider social and economic justice when creating legislation.  The DPSPs serve as a moral compass for law-making.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs also guide the executive branch in formulating and implementing policies. The government is expected to strive towards achieving the goals outlined in the DPSPs through its administrative actions and policy decisions.  While the DPSPs don't legally bind the executive, they provide a framework for socially responsible governance.


**23. Consider the following statements about elections to the Lok Sabha:**

1.  A nomination paper can be filed by any citizen of India.
2. The winning candidate must secure at least 50% of the votes polled.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A nomination paper for the Lok Sabha can be filed by any citizen of India who meets the eligibility criteria (age, citizenship, etc.) and whose name appears on the electoral roll of a constituency. The right to contest elections is a fundamental right, provided the candidate fulfills the requirements outlined in the Representation of the People Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In the first-past-the-post system used in India for Lok Sabha elections, the candidate who secures the highest number of votes in a constituency is declared the winner, even if they don't receive 50% of the total votes polled.  A simple majority is sufficient to win. This system can lead to situations where a candidate wins with less than 50% of the votes, particularly in multi-candidate contests.


**24. Consider the following statements about the Right to Vote in India:**

1. It is a Fundamental Right.
2. It is a Constitutional Right.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The right to vote is considered a fundamental right, though not explicitly mentioned as one of the fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution.  It is implied through the right to equality and the right to participate in the democratic process. The Supreme Court has interpreted various articles of the constitution to imply the right to vote as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct. The right to vote is explicitly guaranteed under the Constitution of India, although not in Part III as a fundamental right. The Constitution establishes the framework for elections and adult suffrage, making the right to vote a constitutional right.  Part XV of the Constitution deals with the Election Commission, which is responsible for conducting elections.  The right to vote is essential for the functioning of a democratic republic.


**25. Consider the following statements about the Election Commission of India:**

1. It is a five-member body.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a five-member body.  It is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and can have up to two other Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners is determined by the government.  However, the CEC always has the final authority on decisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does *not* decide the election schedule. The Election Commission of India is an independent body, and it is solely responsible for determining the election schedule for both general and by-elections.  The independence of the ECI is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.


**26. Consider the following statements about the consequences of President's Rule in a State:**

1. The State Legislative Assembly is automatically dissolved.
2. Local bodies are automatically dissolved.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State Legislative Assembly is *not* automatically dissolved when President's Rule is imposed. The President can choose to dissolve the assembly, but it's not mandatory.  The decision to dissolve the assembly depends on the circumstances and the government's assessment of the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Local bodies are also *not* automatically dissolved when President's Rule is imposed. The dissolution of local bodies is not a necessary consequence of President's Rule.  Such decisions are taken based on the specific circumstances of the situation and might be considered separately.


**27. Consider the following statements about Indian Federalism:**

1. The judiciary is independent.
2. Federating units have unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  An independent judiciary is a cornerstone of Indian federalism. The Supreme Court and High Courts play a vital role in resolving disputes between the Centre and the States, upholding the Constitution, and ensuring that all branches of government act within their constitutional limits.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, the Council of States, provides representation to the States, but this representation is not equal.  States have different numbers of seats in the Rajya Sabha based on their population.  Larger states have more representatives than smaller states. This reflects a compromise between strict population proportionality and the need to give a voice to smaller states.


**28. Consider the following statements about Local Self-Government:**

1. It is an exercise in federalism.
2. It is an exercise in democratic decentralization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Local self-government is not primarily an exercise in federalism.  Federalism deals with the division of powers between the Centre and the States. Local self-government deals with decentralization of power from the state government to local units.


Statement 2 is correct. Local self-government is fundamentally an exercise in democratic decentralization. It aims to empower local communities by giving them a greater say in decision-making processes that affect their lives. It promotes participatory democracy by bringing governance closer to the people.


**29. Consider the following statements about Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers:**

1. Parliament uses adjournment motions to control the Council of Ministers.
2. Parliament uses supplementary questions to control the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Adjournment motions, while rarely successful, are a tool used by Parliament to express its lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers.  Although they are rarely successful in removing the government, they are a way to bring attention to serious issues and hold the government accountable.

Statement 2 is correct. Supplementary questions, which follow up on initial questions during Question Hour, allow members of Parliament to delve deeper into government policies and actions.  This provides a mechanism for scrutinizing the Council of Ministers' performance and holding them accountable.  Through a series of questions, MPs can expose inefficiencies or lack of transparency in government actions.


**30. Consider the following statements about Private Member's Bills:**

1. A private member is a nominated member of Parliament.
2. A private member's bill has never been passed in Indian Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A private member is not necessarily a nominated member. A private member is any Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a minister. Both elected and nominated members can introduce private member's bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While private member's bills are rarely passed, it is not true that they have never been passed in the history of the Indian Parliament. Some private member's bills have been passed into law, although this is a relatively uncommon occurrence.  The passage of a private member's bill requires significant support and consensus within Parliament.


**31. Consider the following statements about the Parliamentary Form of Government:**

1. The executive and legislature work independently.
2. The executive is responsible to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In a parliamentary form of government, the executive and legislature do *not* work independently.  The executive branch is drawn from the legislature (the Council of Ministers is chosen from the members of Parliament).  There is a close relationship and interdependence between the two branches.

Statement 2 is correct. A defining feature of a parliamentary system is that the executive (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the legislature (Parliament).  This means the executive must retain the confidence of the legislature; otherwise, it can be removed through a vote of no confidence.  This accountability mechanism is central to the functioning of a parliamentary democracy.


**32. Consider the following statements about Judicial Review in India:**

1. It involves questioning the wisdom of laws.
2. It involves reviewing legislative enactments before presidential assent.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India does *not* involve questioning the wisdom of laws.  The courts do not assess the effectiveness or desirability of legislation.  Their role is confined to determining whether laws are consistent with the Constitution.  The courts do not express opinions on policy matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Judicial review in India does *not* involve reviewing legislative enactments before presidential assent.  The courts review laws after they have been passed by the legislature and assented to by the President.  This is because the President's assent is a formal constitutional requirement, and the judiciary's role is to ensure that the enacted laws conform to the Constitution.


**33. Consider the following statements about the Government of India Act of 1935:**

1. It established a federal structure with residuary powers vested in the central legislature.
2. It introduced dyarchy at the center.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 established a federal structure, dividing powers between the Centre and the provinces.  A significant aspect of this federal structure was that residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to either the Centre or the provinces) were vested in the central legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did *not* introduce dyarchy at the centre.  Dyarchy was a feature of the provincial governments introduced earlier under the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms.  The central government under the 1935 Act remained largely under British control.


**34.  Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:**

1. Aadhaar can be used as proof of citizenship.
2. Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is not proof of citizenship.  While it is a unique identification number, it does not, by itself, establish citizenship.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal processes and documentation. Aadhaar is a unique identification number which is provided to every resident of India irrespective of their citizenship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated under certain circumstances.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has procedures for deactivating Aad

**1. With reference to the introduction and passage of bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend or reject a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Money Bill, as defined under Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) does not have the power to initiate a Money Bill.  This is a crucial aspect of India's parliamentary system designed to ensure the Lok Sabha, representing the people directly, has primary control over financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill. While it can review the bill and suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha has the final say.  The Rajya Sabha must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, with or without recommendations. The Lok Sabha can then choose to accept or reject those recommendations.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role reflects the principle of the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial legislation.  This prevents the Upper House from unduly delaying or obstructing crucial financial legislation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President can be impeached by a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha alone.
2. The President's election is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The impeachment of the President is a complex process outlined in Article 61 of the Constitution. It requires a resolution passed by a special majority in both Houses of Parliament – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  A simple majority in Rajya Sabha alone is insufficient to initiate impeachment proceedings.  The process involves specific steps, including the giving of notice, investigation, and a two-thirds majority vote in each House.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While disputes regarding presidential elections can be brought before the Supreme Court, the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the final authority to decide election-related disputes, this isn't a general power of judicial review over the election process itself.  The Court's role is limited to adjudicating disputes according to the established constitutional procedure. The election process itself is not subject to broader judicial review, ensuring the integrity and finality of the electoral outcome.


**3. With reference to the powers and functions of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a motion for the removal of the Vice-President.
2. The Rajya Sabha can introduce a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 67 of the Constitution explicitly grants the Rajya Sabha the sole power to initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President. This is a unique power not shared with the Lok Sabha.  The resolution, if passed by a majority of the Rajya Sabha, is then sent to the Lok Sabha for its approval by a simple majority. The Vice-President's removal showcases a check and balance mechanism within the Indian governmental framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power to introduce a Money Bill is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha. Article 117 of the Constitution clearly delineates this.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha and suggesting amendments, but it cannot initiate or reject such a bill.  This reinforces the Lok Sabha's preeminent role in financial matters.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Council of Ministers:**

1. Ministers, including the Prime Minister, must be members of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Rajya Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While ministers can be members of either House, the Constitution does not mandate this.  However, convention and practicality dictate that they are usually members of one of the two Houses.  If a minister is not a member of either House, they must become a member within six months of their appointment.  This ensures parliamentary accountability and participation in legislative processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. This is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system, emphasizing the Lower House's representation of the people's will.  While the Rajya Sabha can scrutinize the government's actions and policies, it does not hold the power to remove the government through a vote of no confidence.  This power rests solely with the Lok Sabha.


**5. With reference to the emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. A proclamation of financial emergency can be revoked only by the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha alone can approve a proclamation of President's Rule if the Lok Sabha is dissolved.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Lok Sabha plays a central role in the functioning of the government, the revocation of a financial emergency (Article 360) requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. It's not solely the prerogative of the Lok Sabha. The process requires a joint effort from both Houses to address such a critical situation affecting the nation's financial stability.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the unique circumstance where the Lok Sabha is dissolved or its dissolution occurs during the period allowed for approving a proclamation of President's Rule (Article 356), the Rajya Sabha's approval alone suffices to keep the proclamation in effect. This is a constitutional safeguard to prevent a vacuum in governance during a period of political instability.  It highlights the Rajya Sabha's role as a stabilizing force in such exceptional circumstances.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding parliamentary privileges:**

1. Parliamentary privileges extend to the President of India.
2. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the freedom of the press to publish parliamentary proceedings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Parliamentary privileges, while designed to protect the independence and functioning of Parliament, do not extend to the President. The President, while an integral part of the Parliament (as per Article 79), operates independently of its privileges.  The President's position requires a level of detachment and impartiality that is separate from the privileges designed for the legislative branch.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 actually *restored* the freedom of the press to publish true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission from the House. Prior to this amendment, restrictions existed, potentially impacting press freedom.  The amendment aimed to balance the need for open parliamentary proceedings with the rights of the press.


**7. With reference to the functions of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on demands for grants.
2. The Rajya Sabha can remove the Council of Ministers by passing a no-confidence motion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, as the Upper House, can participate in the budget discussion and debate the financial proposals presented by the government.  However, the power to vote on the demands for grants, which are crucial for approving government expenditure, is exclusively reserved for the Lok Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government finances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion rests solely with the Lok Sabha.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. While the Rajya Sabha can criticize and debate government policies, it lacks the power to bring down the government through a vote of no confidence.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment of judges in India:**

1. The appointment of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is always the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court.
2. The President appoints other judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts after consulting the CJI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the convention has generally been to appoint the senior-most judge as the CJI, this is not a constitutional mandate.  There have been instances where this convention has been deviated from, leading to controversies.  The President's decision in such appointments retains a degree of discretion, even if guided by convention.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India appoints judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts. However, the Constitution mandates that the President must consult the CJI before making these appointments.  This consultation is a critical step in ensuring the independence and integrity of the judiciary.  The CJI's recommendation significantly influences the President's decision.


**9. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has 250 members.
2. Twelve members are nominated by the President to represent specific fields of expertise.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, has a maximum strength of 250 members. However, the actual strength may be less than this maximum. The composition reflects representation from the states and union territories.


Statement 2 is correct. The President of India nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, who represent fields such as literature, science, art, and social service. These nominations aim to bring diverse expertise and perspectives to the legislative process. This is a unique feature of the Rajya Sabha's composition.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding the passage of an ordinary bill in the Indian Parliament:**

1.  An ordinary bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2.  If the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha disagree on the amendments to a bill, a joint sitting can be called to resolve the deadlock.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.  Unlike Money Bills, which can only originate in the Lok Sabha, ordinary bills can begin their legislative journey in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  This reflects a more balanced approach to lawmaking compared to financial legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. If both Houses fail to reach an agreement on amendments to an ordinary bill, the President can summon a joint sitting of both Houses to resolve the deadlock. This is a constitutional mechanism to prevent legislative gridlock and ensure the passage of important legislation.  The Lok Sabha, having a larger representation, typically prevails in the joint sitting.  However, this mechanism is not applicable to Money Bills or Constitutional Amendment Bills.


**11. With reference to the state legislative councils, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can be introduced only in the State Legislative Assembly and not in the State Legislative Council.
2. The State Legislative Council can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum period of one year.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Similar to the relationship between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Money Bills in state legislatures can only be introduced in the State Legislative Assembly (the lower house). The State Legislative Council (the upper house) has limited powers regarding Money Bills.  This is a feature reflecting the principle of the lower house's dominance in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The State Legislative Council cannot delay an ordinary bill for a full year.  It can delay the bill for a maximum period of four months (three months initially, and an additional one month after reconsideration), but not a year.  This is significantly less power than the Rajya Sabha's ability to delay an ordinary bill for up to six months.  The State Legislative Council's power is more limited and emphasizes the State Legislative Assembly's prominence.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President for a term of six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and the State Legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President for a term of six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure and age limit contribute to the CAG's independence and impartiality in auditing government accounts.  The appointment process ensures a degree of separation from political influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits audit reports to both the Parliament and the State Legislatures.  This ensures accountability and transparency in the use of public funds at both the Union and State levels.  These reports are essential for parliamentary oversight of government finances.



**13. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. It is constituted every five years.
2. Its recommendations are binding on the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Commission of India is a constitutional body established every five years.  Its primary role is to recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States, and to make recommendations on grants-in-aid to the States.  The five-year cycle ensures regular review and adjustments to the financial arrangements between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the government.  The government considers these recommendations, but it retains the discretion to accept or reject them, or to modify them.  This reflects the government's ultimate responsibility for financial policy.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a single-member body.
2. The Election Commission resolves disputes relating to the splits/mergers of recognized political parties.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  However, the Constitution originally envisioned a three-member commission (one CEC and two ECs).  Currently, the commission can have a maximum of three members, but the current setup is a single member.  The composition is subject to change based on the needs of election management.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Election Commission of India plays a crucial role in resolving disputes related to splits and mergers of recognized political parties. It is empowered to decide on matters relating to party symbols, the allotment of seats, and other electoral disputes.  This ensures the fair and impartial conduct of elections and the stability of the political system.


**15. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are non-justiciable.  This means that they cannot be enforced by courts of law.  They are guidelines for the government to strive towards, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs reflects the Constitution's recognition that the government's ability to implement these principles might be constrained by various factors.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs, as enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, provide a framework for establishing a welfare state in India. They aim to promote social and economic justice, equality, and the well-being of all citizens.  These principles guide government policies and programs aimed at improving the quality of life for all citizens.  They represent the social and economic goals that the Indian state aims to achieve.


**1. With reference to the introduction and passage of ordinary bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay, but not ultimately reject, an ordinary bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2.  A joint sitting of both Houses is convened only if the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha fail to agree on a constitutional amendment bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, as the upper house, can scrutinize and amend ordinary bills originating in the Lok Sabha. However, the Lok Sabha's power to pass a bill ultimately prevails.  If the Rajya Sabha fails to return the bill within 14 days, or if the Lok Sabha rejects the amendments made by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed passed by Parliament. The Rajya Sabha cannot indefinitely block legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament is convened only to resolve disagreements on *ordinary* bills, not constitutional amendment bills. Constitutional amendments have a special procedure defined in Article 368. Although both Houses must pass a constitutional amendment bill, there is no provision for a joint sitting to resolve disagreements.  If the two houses disagree, the bill is deemed defeated.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impeachment of the President of India:**

1. The Rajya Sabha initiates the impeachment process by passing a resolution with a special majority.
2.  The Lok Sabha can reject the impeachment resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 61 of the Constitution outlines the impeachment process for the President. It begins with the Rajya Sabha, where a resolution specifying the charges must be passed by at least two-thirds of the members present and voting.  This is a special majority.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Once the Rajya Sabha passes the resolution, it is transmitted to the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha then investigates the charges and can either pass or reject the resolution. If the Lok Sabha passes the resolution with a simple majority, the President is removed from office.  The Lok Sabha cannot simply reject the resolution without conducting its own proceedings.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a motion for the removal of the Vice-President.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 67 of the Constitution grants the Rajya Sabha the exclusive power to initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President. The Lok Sabha only needs to concur with a simple majority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Money bills, dealing exclusively with financial matters as defined in Article 110, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha has limited powers regarding money bills; it can only suggest amendments, but the Lok Sabha can accept or reject those amendments.


**4. With reference to the role of the Parliament in the appointment of constitutional functionaries, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliament recommends the removal of the Chief Justice of India to the President.
2. Parliament plays a direct role in the selection of the members of the Union Public Service Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the President has the power to remove judges, including the Chief Justice of India, this power is exercised based on a recommendation from Parliament.  The process involves an address by both Houses of Parliament seeking the removal of the judge on grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Parliament approves the terms and conditions of service for the UPSC members, the President appoints them on the recommendation of the government. Parliament doesn't directly select the members.

1. A financial bill, not solely containing matters under Article 110, can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a financial bill, but the Lok Sabha can override this rejection.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Financial bills, even those not exclusively covered under Article 110 (which defines money bills), can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations, the Lok Sabha has the final say.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a financial bill. It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's decision is final.


**6. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can pass a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The principle of collective responsibility means that the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha.  A vote of no-confidence can be moved in the Lok Sabha, and if passed, leads to the resignation of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot move a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers. This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha, reflecting the principle of popular sovereignty.


**7. With reference to the special powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can authorize Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List for a limited period.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the sole power to create new All-India Services.

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 allows the Rajya Sabha, by a two-thirds majority resolution, to authorize Parliament to legislate on subjects mentioned in the State List if it deems necessary in the national interest.  This authorization is for a limited period.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 312 grants the Rajya Sabha the exclusive power to resolve the creation of new All-India Services (like the IAS and IPS) if the need arises.  The Lok Sabha needs to concur with the decision.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the parliamentary privileges:**

1. Parliamentary privileges are explicitly defined and enumerated in the Constitution.
2. The President of India enjoys parliamentary privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 2 is incorrect. Parliamentary privileges are enjoyed by the Houses of Parliament, their committees, and their members. The President, although part of Parliament, does not enjoy these privileges.


**9. With reference to the functioning of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill can be introduced only by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.
2.  The Lok Sabha can reject a private member's bill without debate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is introduced by an MP who is not a minister.  Government bills, on the other hand, are introduced by ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha cannot simply reject a private member's bill without debate.  While the chances of a private member's bill being passed are slim, it still goes through the normal legislative process, including discussions and voting.

1.  The Rajya Sabha has members representing states elected directly by the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Members of the Rajya Sabha representing states are elected indirectly by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies, not directly by the people.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution mandates reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, proportional to their population in different states.


**11. With reference to the powers of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker decides whether a bill is a money bill.
2. The Speaker presides over joint sittings of both houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the final authority to certify whether a bill is a money bill or not.  This power is crucial because money bills have a special legislative process.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the event of a disagreement between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on an ordinary bill, a joint sitting is convened, and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over this joint sitting.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the President's rule in a state:**

1. The President's rule can be imposed only if the state government fails to comply with the directions of the Union government.
2. The President's rule automatically dissolves the state legislative assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While failure to comply with Union government directives can be a reason for imposing President's rule (Article 356), it's not the only reason.  The President's rule can be imposed under various circumstances, including a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's rule under Article 356 does not automatically dissolve the state legislative assembly. The President can choose to dissolve the assembly or allow it to continue.


**13. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a rigid distribution of powers between the Centre and the States.
2. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature at both the Union and State levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian federal system is not entirely rigid. The Constitution allows for the Centre to encroach upon State subjects in certain circumstances (like during emergencies or through concurrent lists).  There is also a degree of flexibility in the distribution of powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature at the Union level (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), but not all States have bicameral legislatures. Many states have only a unicameral legislature (Legislative Assembly).


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List:**

1.  Subjects in the Union List are exclusively within the domain of the Union Parliament.
2. Subjects in the Concurrent List can be legislated upon by both the Union and State legislatures, but Union law prevails in case of conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union List contains subjects of national importance, and only the Union Parliament can legislate on them.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Concurrent List allows both the Union and State legislatures to make laws on the listed subjects. However, in case of conflict, the Union law prevails.  This is a crucial feature of the Indian federal system that allows the Centre to maintain national uniformity on important matters.


**15.  With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Panchayats and Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India is currently a single-member body, headed by the Chief Election Commissioner. Although it used to be a multi-member body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India conducts elections to the Parliament and State legislatures.  The conduct of Panchayat and Municipal elections is usually the responsibility of State Election Commissions, established under state laws.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governor of each state.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  This is a crucial aspect of the relationship between the Centre and the States, ensuring that the Centre retains ultimate control.  However, in practice, this power is rarely used arbitrarily.


**17. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in courts.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable in courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to frame its policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice, equality, and the overall welfare of the people.  They guide government policy towards creating a more equitable society.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State governments.
2. The CAG submits its audit reports directly to the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments, and other bodies as prescribed by the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG submits its audit reports to the Parliament, not the President.  This ensures accountability and transparency in government spending.  The reports are then laid before both Houses of Parliament.


**19. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats, proportional to their population in the respective areas.  This is crucial for ensuring their participation in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act promotes a three-tier Panchayati Raj system, it doesn't mandate it in all states.  The specific structure of Panchayati Raj varies from state to state, depending on the state's geographical and demographic conditions.


**20. Consider the following statements concerning the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, prepared by the Finance Ministry, is presented annually to the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister.  This is a key event in the Indian financial year.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend the Union Budget. It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha's decision is final.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Life, which encompasses the Right to a Healthy Environment.
2. Article 275(1) mandates the provision of grants for improving administration in Scheduled Areas to benefit Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of provisions within the Indian Constitution.  Article 21, while primarily concerned with the right to life, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to a healthy environment.  Numerous landmark judgments have affirmed this interpretation, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental health and human well-being.  The state's obligation under Article 21 extends to protecting citizens from environmental harm.  Similarly, Article 275(1) explicitly addresses the need for special financial provisions to uplift the administrative capacity within Scheduled Areas, primarily to serve the welfare of Scheduled Tribes residing in these regions. This provision acknowledges the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by these communities and aims to ensure their equitable development.  Therefore, both statements correctly reflect constitutional provisions.


**2. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles explicitly mandate the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code.
2. The Constitution explicitly directs Panchayats to prepare plans for economic development and social justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) advocate for a Uniform Civil Code, it's not a mandatory directive. The Constitution does not explicitly compel the government to implement a Uniform Civil Code.  It's a goal to be strived for, but not a legally enforceable obligation. Statement 2 is correct.  Although not explicitly stated in the same way as other directives, the spirit of empowering Panchayats to participate in planning for economic development and social justice is inherent in the Directive Principles, particularly those related to local self-governance and rural development. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act further solidified this by providing constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions, emphasizing their role in local development.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha possesses the sole power to amend the election procedure for the President of India.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to create new All-India Services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the sole power to amend the election procedure for the President.  While the Rajya Sabha plays a role in the process, the Parliament as a whole (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) is involved in any constitutional amendments related to the Presidential election. The process involves a special majority in both houses. Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, through a resolution passed by a two-thirds majority, can empower Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List.  This power extends to the creation of new All-India Services. This power reflects the Rajya Sabha's role in representing the states and ensuring their interests are considered in matters of national importance.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the consumers' rights in India:**

1. Consumers are legally empowered to collect samples of food products for independent testing.
2. Filing a complaint in a consumer forum is always free of charge for consumers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Consumer protection laws in India empower consumers to take samples of food products for testing to verify their quality and safety. This right is crucial for ensuring accountability from producers and businesses regarding the goods they offer to the public.  This right is often exercised when consumers suspect adulteration or substandard quality in products. Statement 2 is incorrect. While consumer forums aim to make the process accessible, filing fees may be required depending on the value of the claim and the level of the forum (District Forum, State Commission, or National Commission).  The fee structure is defined under the Consumer Protection Act, and a nominal fee is usually involved to initiate a complaint.


**5. With reference to the office of the Lok Sabha Speaker, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker holds office during the pleasure of the President of India.
2. A person need not be a member of the Lok Sabha at the time of election as Speaker but must become a member within six months.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha Speaker holds office during the pleasure of the Lok Sabha, not the President.  While the President appoints the Speaker, the Speaker's tenure is linked to the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  A vote of no confidence can lead to the removal of the Speaker. Statement 2 is correct.  A candidate need not be a member of the Lok Sabha at the time of their election as Speaker. However, the Constitution mandates that the person must become a member of the Lok Sabha within six months of their election. This ensures that the Speaker maintains a direct link to the House they preside over.


**6. With reference to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Disputes between the Government of India and a Union Territory fall under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
2. Disputes between two or more States fall under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Disputes between the Government of India and a Union Territory do not fall under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction is specifically defined in Article 131 of the Constitution, primarily encompassing disputes between the Government of India and one or more States or between two or more States. Statement 2 is correct.  Disputes between two or more States are explicitly included within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. This reflects the Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of inter-state conflicts, ensuring the smooth functioning of the federal structure.  The Court's power in this area is crucial for maintaining peace and harmony among the states.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act, 1919:**

1. The Act introduced diarchy at the provincial level, dividing executive functions between Indian ministers and British officials.
2.  The Act introduced separate communal electorates for Muslims, providing them with separate representation in the legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of the Government of India Act, 1919.  The Act introduced diarchy, a system of dual governance at the provincial level.  Executive functions were divided between Indian ministers, responsible for certain "transferred" subjects, and British officials, who retained control over "reserved" subjects. This was an attempt to gradually introduce Indian participation in governance while maintaining British control over key areas.  Crucially, the Act also introduced separate communal electorates, a significant departure from previous systems. This provision allowed Muslims to elect their representatives separately from other communities, marking a step towards separate representation based on religious identity.  This feature has had a lasting impact on Indian politics and the evolution of its electoral system.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG exercises exchequer control on behalf of the Parliament during a national emergency declared by the President.
2. The CAG's reports on project execution are reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG audits government expenditure, they do not directly exercise "exchequer control" during a national emergency.  Exchequer control refers to the government's power to manage public funds, which remains primarily with the executive branch even during emergencies. The CAG's role is to audit government spending, ensuring its compliance with laws and regulations. Statement 2 is correct. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament plays a crucial role in scrutinizing the CAG's reports. The PAC examines these reports, which detail the execution of various government projects and programs. They analyze whether public funds were used efficiently and for their intended purposes.  The PAC's recommendations based on the CAG's audit findings are vital for parliamentary oversight of government finances.


**9. With reference to the appointment of the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister must be a member of one of the Houses of Parliament at the time of appointment.
2. If the appointed Prime Minister is not a member of either House, they must become a member within six months.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prime Minister does not need to be a member of either House of Parliament *at the time of appointment*.  The Constitution only requires the Prime Minister to enjoy the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  Many Prime Ministers have been appointed while not being members of Parliament, and they subsequently joined one of the Houses. Statement 2 is correct.  If the appointed Prime Minister is not a member of either House of Parliament at the time of appointment, they are required to become a member within six months of their appointment. This requirement is crucial to ensure the Prime Minister's accountability to the Parliament.  The Prime Minister's role involves interaction with both houses, participating in debates, and answering questions.


**10. With reference to the Delimitation Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The orders of the Delimitation Commission are judicially reviewable.
2. The Parliament can modify the orders of the Delimitation Commission after they are presented to the Houses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The orders of the Delimitation Commission are generally considered final and not subject to judicial review.  The Commission is a constitutional body established to demarcate electoral constituencies, and its decisions are intended to be definitive to ensure the smooth conduct of elections. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament cannot modify the orders of the Delimitation Commission after they have been presented to the Houses.  Once the Commission submits its report, it is essentially final.  The aim is to maintain the neutrality and integrity of the delimitation process, avoiding political influence after the Commission has completed its work.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India's duty to lay reports before Parliament:**

1. The President must lay before the Parliament the recommendations of the Union Finance Commission.
2. The President must lay before the Parliament the report of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the President's constitutional duty.  The President is constitutionally obligated to lay before Parliament the recommendations of the Union Finance Commission. These recommendations are crucial for determining the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States, and parliamentary scrutiny is vital for ensuring transparency and accountability.  Similarly, the President is required to lay before Parliament the report of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.  This report examines the welfare and rights of Scheduled Castes, and its presentation to Parliament ensures that their concerns receive due attention and action from the legislature.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding a joint sitting of Parliament:**

1. A joint sitting can be convened to resolve a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the passage of an ordinary legislation.
2. A joint sitting can be convened to resolve a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the passage of a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Constitution allows for a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament to resolve deadlocks on the passage of an ordinary bill. If the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha fail to reach an agreement, a joint sitting can be called by the President to resolve the impasse and allow the bill to proceed.  This mechanism ensures that legislative processes are not indefinitely stalled due to disagreements between the two Houses. Statement 2 is incorrect. A joint sitting cannot be convened to resolve a deadlock on a Money Bill. Money Bills are specifically exempted from the joint sitting provision. This is because Money Bills are primarily the domain of the Lok Sabha, reflecting its role as the House of the People, more directly responsible for financial matters.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Fundamental Duties of citizens as enshrined in the Indian Constitution:**

1.  Protecting weaker sections from social injustice is a Fundamental Duty.
2. Striving towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity is a Fundamental Duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Constitution promotes social justice and the protection of weaker sections, it does not explicitly list "protecting weaker sections from social injustice" as a Fundamental Duty. The Fundamental Duties focus on broader societal responsibilities and individual conduct. Statement 2 is correct.  "Strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity" is explicitly listed as a Fundamental Duty in the Indian Constitution.  This duty emphasizes the importance of personal and collective achievement and contribution to the nation's progress.  It promotes a sense of responsibility and the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of life.


**14. Consider the following statements about the autonomy of the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The President consults the Chief Justice of India while appointing Supreme Court judges.
2. The salaries of Supreme Court judges are subject to the approval of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India consults the Chief Justice of India (CJI) while appointing judges to the Supreme Court. This consultation is a crucial element in maintaining the independence of the judiciary.  The CJI's opinion on the suitability of candidates is given significant weight, preventing political influence in judicial appointments. Statement 2 is incorrect. The salaries and allowances of Supreme Court judges are not subject to the approval of the Parliament.  They are charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India, meaning they are automatically allocated and not subject to yearly budgetary approval. This financial independence is a key aspect of judicial autonomy, shielding judges from potential political pressure through budgetary control.


**15. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairman of the Finance Commission is a member of the NDC.
2. The Chief Ministers of all States are members of the NDC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairman of the Finance Commission is not a member of the National Development Council (NDC). The NDC's composition includes the Prime Minister, Union Cabinet Ministers, and Chief Ministers of all States and Union Territories with legislatures. Statement 2 is correct. The Chief Ministers of all States are members of the NDC.  This reflects the NDC's role as a forum for coordinating development planning at the national and state levels.  The inclusion of Chief Ministers ensures that state-level perspectives and priorities are considered in national development strategies.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts:**

1. The Committee consists of not more than 25 members of the Lok Sabha.
2. The Committee scrutinizes the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is not limited to 25 members of the Lok Sabha.  While it is primarily composed of members from the Lok Sabha, the number of members is not fixed at 25.  The size of the committee is determined by the rules of the House. Statement 2 is correct. The PAC's primary function is to scrutinize the reports submitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).  These reports detail the audit of government accounts, and the PAC examines them to assess whether public funds have been used efficiently and for their intended purposes.  The PAC's recommendations based on the CAG's findings are vital for ensuring accountability in government spending.


**17. With reference to the principles implied in Indian parliamentary government, consider the following statements:**

1. Ministers must be members of Parliament.
2. The Cabinet is headed by the Head of State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A fundamental principle of the Indian parliamentary system is that ministers must be members of Parliament. This ensures that the executive branch is accountable to the legislature.  Ministers participate in parliamentary debates, answer questions, and are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.  This direct link between the executive and legislature is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cabinet in India is headed by the Prime Minister, not the Head of State (the President).  The President is the constitutional head, but the Prime Minister, as the head of government, leads the Cabinet and is responsible for its functioning.  This division of powers is a key aspect of India's parliamentary system.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers at the Centre:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to Parliament.
2. Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct principles of the Indian parliamentary system. Statement 1 accurately reflects the principle of collective responsibility. The entire Council of Ministers is accountable to Parliament; a vote of no confidence against the government can lead to its resignation.  This ensures that the executive branch remains answerable to the legislature. Statement 2 also correctly states that Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.  This means that the President can dismiss a minister on the advice of the Prime Minister.  While the President's power is formally exercised, it's practically dependent on the Prime Minister's recommendation, upholding the Prime Minister's leadership of the government.


**19. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is an organ of the Planning Commission.
2. Economic and Social Planning is a subject listed in the Concurrent List of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not an organ of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission was a body established by a resolution of the government, while the NDC is a high-level body involving the Prime Minister, Union Ministers, and Chief Ministers.  The NDC's role is to coordinate development planning, and it's not directly linked to the Planning Commission's structure.  The Planning Commission was replaced by NITI Aayog in 2015. Statement 2 is correct.  Economic and Social Planning is indeed a subject listed in the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution.  This means both the Union and State governments can legislate on this subject.  This reflects the shared responsibility for planning and development between the central and state governments.


**20. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are not members of that House.
2. Nominated members of Parliament have voting rights in the election of the Vice-President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are members of the Rajya Sabha. They are elected from amongst the members of the House.  This ensures that the presiding officers have a direct connection to the House's functioning and membership. Statement 2 is correct. Nominated members of Parliament do have voting rights in the election of the Vice-President. Unlike Presidential elections, where nominated members do not vote, they participate in the Vice-Presidential election, reflecting the different constitutional provisions for each office.


**21. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA's objective is to provide free legal services to weaker sections of society.
2. NALSA issues guidelines for State Legal Services Authorities to implement legal programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the functions and objectives of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA).  NALSA's primary aim is to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker and marginalized sections of society.  This ensures that access to justice is not limited by economic constraints, and all citizens have the opportunity to seek legal redress.  NALSA works towards equal opportunity in accessing justice. Statement 2 is also correct. NALSA plays a crucial role in formulating and issuing guidelines for the State Legal Services Authorities (SLSAs).  These guidelines ensure uniformity and effectiveness in implementing legal aid programs and schemes across the country.


**22. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Forest Department initiates the process for determining forest rights.
2. The Gram Sabha is the primary authority to initiate the process for determining forest rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State Forest Department does not initiate the process for determining forest rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.  The Act emphasizes the role of Gram Sabhas in this process.  The Gram Sabha, the village assembly, is given the primary authority to identify and record the claims of forest rights. Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha is the primary authority to initiate the process for determining the nature and extent of individual or community forest rights. This reflects the Act's focus on empowering local communities and recognizing their traditional rights over forest resources.


**23. Consider the following statements:**

1. "Economic Justice" is mentioned in the Preamble and Fundamental Rights of the Indian Constitution.
2. "Economic Justice" is mentioned in the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Preamble mentions "justice, social, economic and political," and Fundamental Rights aim to secure these, "Economic Justice" isn't explicitly mentioned as a separate element within Fundamental Rights.  The Fundamental Rights focus on individual liberties and freedoms. Statement 2 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy explicitly aim to secure "economic justice."  These principles guide the state towards achieving social and economic equality and welfare.  They set out the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional location of "Economic Justice."


**24. With reference to a Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. If the Rajya Sabha substantially amends a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha can still proceed with the bill, accepting or rejecting the amendments.
2. If the Rajya Sabha rejects a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha can still pass the bill after a certain period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on a Money Bill. If the Rajya Sabha makes substantial amendments, the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject those amendments.  The Rajya Sabha's power is limited to recommending changes, not vetoing the bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters. Statement 2 is incorrect. If the Rajya Sabha rejects a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha does *not* have the power to pass it after a certain period.  The Lok Sabha can only consider the recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha, but the Rajya Sabha cannot block the passage of a Money Bill indefinitely.  The Lok Sabha’s authority on Money Bills is constitutionally protected.


**25. With reference to the appointment of Governors in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The same person can be appointed as Governor for two or more States simultaneously.
2. The Constitution lays down a specific procedure for the removal of a Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution allows for the appointment of the same person as Governor for two or more States simultaneously. This is a pragmatic arrangement, especially given the large number of states in India.  It's more efficient to utilize the expertise and experience of a single Governor across multiple states rather than appointing separate individuals for each. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* lay down a specific procedure for the removal of a Governor.  The Governor holds office at the pleasure of the President, implying that the President can remove the Governor at any time without a specific process.  This reflects the President's executive power and the Governor's subordinate position within the federal structure.


**26. With reference to the Constituent Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. Members of the Constituent Assembly from the Provinces were directly elected by the people.
2. The Government selected members of the Constituent Assembly based on expertise in constitutional matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Members of the Constituent Assembly from the Provinces were *not* directly elected by the people. They were elected indirectly by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies.  This was a reflection of the existing political structure at the time. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Government did not directly select members based on constitutional expertise alone, the composition did include individuals with significant legal and political experience.  The selection process was primarily based on the Provincial Assemblies' elections, and these Assemblies tended to elect individuals with relevant expertise and standing.


**27. Consider the following statements about constitutional amendments in India:**

1. Constitutional amendments can be initiated only by introducing a bill in the Lok Sabha.
2. Amendments affecting the federal character of the Constitution require ratification by all State legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a constitutional amendment bill can be introduced in the Lok Sabha, it can also be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.  Both Houses play an equal role in the amendment process.  The bill needs to be passed by both Houses with special majorities. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Amendments affecting the federal character of the Constitution do not require ratification by *all* State legislatures.  Certain amendments require ratification by at least half of the State legislatures, but it is not a requirement for all states to ratify the amendment. The specific requirements for ratification vary depending on the nature of the amendment.


**28. Consider the following statements about the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General can vote in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Attorney General can speak in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Attorney General of India cannot vote in the Lok Sabha.  They are not a member of Parliament and do not have voting rights.  The Attorney General's role is primarily advisory to the government on legal matters. Statement 2 is correct. The Attorney General can speak in the Lok Sabha. They can participate in debates and offer legal opinions on matters under discussion.  This right to speak allows the Attorney General to provide expert legal advice and insight to the House.


**29. Consider the following statements about bodies mentioned in the Indian Constitution:**

1. The National Development Council is mentioned in the Constitution.
2. The Planning Commission is mentioned in the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Neither the National Development Council (NDC) nor the Planning Commission is explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. The NDC is a high-level body established by a government resolution, and the Planning Commission was also a body created through a government resolution.  Their functions relate to economic planning and development, but they are not constitutional bodies.  The Planning Commission was replaced by NITI Aayog.


**30. Consider the following statements about the Parliament's power to make laws for implementing international treaties:**

1. Parliament needs the consent of all States to make laws implementing international treaties.
2. Parliament needs the consent of the majority of States to make laws implementing international treaties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Parliament does *not* require the consent of any State to make laws implementing international treaties.  The power to enter into international treaties and implement them through legislation rests with the Union government, reflecting India's unitary nature in foreign affairs.  The Parliament's power in this area is supreme, and it doesn't need the approval of individual States.  This is a crucial aspect of India's sovereignty and its ability to conduct independent foreign policy.


**31. With reference to the objectives of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. One objective of PESA is to create autonomous regions in tribal areas.
2. One objective of PESA is to free tribal people from exploitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PESA does not aim to create autonomous regions in tribal areas in the sense of separate administrative units.  Its focus is on empowering existing Gram Sabhas and giving them greater control over local governance within the existing administrative framework.  While it enhances self-governance, it does not create separate administrative entities. Statement 2 is correct.  A primary objective of PESA is to protect tribal people from exploitation and ensure their equitable development.  The Act aims to prevent the marginalization and exploitation of tribal communities by vesting greater authority in their local governance structures.  It seeks to empower them to manage their own affairs and resources.


**32. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Gujarati has been declared a Classical Language by the Government of India.
2. Kannada has been declared a Classical Language by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Both Gujarati and Kannada have been officially declared as Classical Languages by the Government of India.  This recognition reflects the rich history, literary tradition, and cultural significance of these languages.  The declaration of a language as "Classical" entails certain benefits, including increased government support for its preservation and promotion.


**33. Consider the following statements:**

1. The largest committee of Parliament is the Committee on Public Accounts.
2. The sales tax on goods is imposed and collected by the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The largest committee of Parliament is the Committee on Estimates, not the Committee on Public Accounts.  The Committee on Estimates is responsible for examining the estimates included in the Union Budget.  The Committee on Public Accounts scrutinizes the CAG's reports on government expenditure. Statement 2 is correct. Sales tax on goods is primarily imposed and collected by State Governments in India.  This is a key aspect of India's federal tax structure, with States having significant control over indirect taxes on goods and services within their territories.


**34. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions regarding anti-defection.
2. In the Constitution of India, the promotion of international peace and security is included in the Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with anti-def

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is a constitutional body established under Article 280 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Economic and Social Planning is explicitly mentioned in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a constitutional body. It was established in 1952 by a resolution of the government, not by a constitutional provision.  The NDC plays a crucial role in coordinating the planning process at the national level but lacks the constitutional backing of a body established directly through the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States.  While economic and social planning are significant aspects of governance, they aren't exclusively or explicitly assigned to the Union List.  The Concurrent List allows for both Union and State legislation on matters related to planning, reflecting the shared nature of these responsibilities.  The Constitution's framework is flexible enough to accommodate national planning initiatives without rigidly defining them within a single list.

Therefore, neither statement is correct.



**2. With reference to the Union Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and the President appoints other ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha but not to the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then advises the President on the appointment of other ministers. This reflects the parliamentary system where the executive is responsible to the legislature. While the President holds the formal power of appointment, the actual choice of ministers rests with the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is correct. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, which represents the people directly.  While the Rajya Sabha, the upper house, plays a vital role in the legislative process, it does not have the power to remove the government through a vote of no confidence.  The Lok Sabha's power to dismiss the government underscores its central role in the parliamentary system of accountability.

Both statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions and the dynamics of the Union Council of Ministers.



**3. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA is an autonomous body established under Article 39A of the Constitution of India.
2. NALSA's primary function is to provide legal aid to the marginalized and vulnerable sections of society, but it does not directly handle individual cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NALSA is not established under Article 39A. While Article 39A deals with equal justice and free legal aid, NALSA's establishment is through the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987,  a legislative act, not a direct constitutional provision.  Although the Act aims to give effect to the constitutional guarantee of free legal aid, NALSA itself doesn't derive its existence from a specific constitutional article.

Statement 2 is largely correct. NALSA's primary mandate is to ensure access to justice for the poor and marginalized. It functions by establishing a framework for legal aid programs across the country through state-level authorities,  laying down policies and guidelines.  While NALSA doesn't directly handle individual cases, it plays a vital role in enabling legal aid at the ground level.

Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially correct.



**4. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the constitution of Special Courts exclusively to try cases under the Act.
2. The Act provides for stringent punishments for atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, including provisions for anticipatory bail.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, mandates the setting up of Special Courts to deal exclusively with cases under the Act. This ensures faster disposal of cases and specialized handling of these sensitive matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act provides for stringent punishments, it explicitly restricts the grant of anticipatory bail in cases registered under the Act.  The intention is to prevent potential intimidation of victims and witnesses.  The Act aims to ensure effective prosecution of crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.



**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President, but the tenure is not during the President's pleasure. The CAG holds office until the age of 65 or until the completion of a fixed term, whichever comes earlier.  The CAG’s independence is constitutionally guaranteed to ensure impartiality in auditing government accounts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  This is a crucial aspect of financial oversight, ensuring accountability and transparency in public expenditure at all levels of government. The CAG’s reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively.

Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct (regarding the appointment and tenure).



**6. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted every five years by the President of India.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union Government but not on the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President constitutes the Finance Commission every five years, or as per the need and situation.  This ensures regular reviews of the financial relations between the Union and the States. The commission's composition and term are specified by the President.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding, they carry significant weight and are generally accepted by both the Union and State Governments. The government's acceptance of recommendations reflects the importance of maintaining fiscal federalism.  The recommendations are considered crucial for maintaining balance and fairness in the distribution of resources.

Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct.



**7. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.  Although the Governor enjoys a certain degree of autonomy, the ultimate authority rests with the President.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration. This power allows for a check on the State Legislature's actions, particularly on matters of national importance or constitutional significance.


Therefore, both statements correctly describe powers and functions of the Governor.



**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable in a court of law.
2. They aim to establish a welfare state by providing social and economic justice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles are non-justiciable. They are not directly enforceable in a court of law.  They serve as guidelines for the State to frame its policies and laws to achieve social and economic justice.  The courts cannot compel the State to implement them.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by ensuring social and economic justice. They outline the State's responsibilities in ensuring the well-being of its citizens.  They are aspirational goals that guide the government's actions.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**9. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a State Finance Commission to review the financial position of Panchayats.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act empowers Panchayats to levy taxes on property and profession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) mandates the establishment of a State Finance Commission to review the financial position of Panchayats and make recommendations on their financial resources. This ensures that Panchayats have adequate resources to perform their functions.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment empowers Panchayats to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, and fees. This enhances their financial autonomy and enables them to raise funds independently.  The specific taxes and duties may vary depending on State legislation.

Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the provisions of the 73rd Amendment.



**10. With reference to the Fundamental Rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Right to Equality includes the abolition of untouchability and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
2. Right to Freedom includes the freedom of speech and expression, but it doesn't include the right to form associations or unions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Right to Equality, enshrined in Articles 14-18 of the Indian Constitution, includes the abolition of untouchability (Article 17) and the prohibition of discrimination on various grounds (Article 15). This is a cornerstone of social justice in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Right to Freedom, under Articles 19-22, includes the freedom of speech and expression, as well as the freedom to form associations or unions (Article 19). These freedoms are essential for a democratic society.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of only one Chief Election Commissioner and a variable number of Election Commissioners appointed by the President.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India's composition is not fixed by the Constitution. It comprises a Chief Election Commissioner and such other Election Commissioners as the President may appoint.  The number of Election Commissioners can vary depending on the workload and the needs of the commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body, is responsible for deciding the election schedule. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does not have this power; it deals with legal matters and the formulation of laws, not the operational aspects of elections.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's rule necessitates the immediate dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, irrespective of the circumstances leading to its imposition.
2. The removal of the State Council of Ministers is a mandatory consequence of the President's rule proclamation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not mandatory. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, especially if there's a chance of restoring normalcy without an election.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The removal of the State Council of Ministers is a usual consequence of the President’s rule but not a mandatory one.  The President may decide to retain the council of ministers for a short period to facilitate the smooth transition.  The decision is based on the specific circumstances and the assessment of the situation.


**3. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a bicameral legislature with the Rajya Sabha providing equal representation to all states.
2. The division of powers between the Centre and the States is clearly defined and unalterable, ensuring a rigid federal structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India has a bicameral legislature, the Rajya Sabha doesn't provide equal representation to all states.  States have unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha based on their population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian federal structure is flexible.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and States, while largely defined, can be altered through constitutional amendments.  The system is not rigid; it allows for adjustments based on evolving needs.


**4. With reference to the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can directly remove individual ministers through a vote of no confidence.
2.  The Question Hour is a mechanism primarily aimed at scrutinizing the conduct of individual bureaucrats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament can remove the entire Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister. However, it cannot directly remove individual ministers through a separate vote of no confidence. Individual ministers are accountable to the Prime Minister, who is accountable to the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Question Hour is primarily designed to hold the Council of Ministers accountable for their actions and policies. While it can indirectly touch upon bureaucratic actions, its main focus is on ministerial responsibility.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill in the Indian Parliament can only be introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.
2.  The President of India can introduce a private member's bill in either House of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill is introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a member of the Council of Ministers.  These bills often deal with issues of public interest not directly addressed by the government's legislative agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President of India cannot introduce a bill in Parliament; this right is vested in the Members of Parliament.  The President plays a crucial role in the legislative process through assent to bills passed by Parliament, but not through introducing bills.


**6. With reference to the Parliamentary form of government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The executive and legislature are completely independent of each other in this system.
2.  This system ensures that the executive is accountable to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In a parliamentary system, the executive (Council of Ministers) and legislature (Parliament) are interdependent. The executive is drawn from the legislature, and the legislature holds the executive accountable.

Statement 2 is correct. A defining feature of a parliamentary system is the executive's accountability to the legislature.  The legislature can remove the government through a vote of no confidence, ensuring that the executive remains responsive to the will of the representatives of the people.


**7. With reference to the Cabinet form of Government, consider the following statements:**

1. It is primarily a mechanism to minimize criticism against the government by ensuring collective responsibility.
2. It is a device designed to strengthen the position of the head of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Cabinet form of government operates on the principle of collective responsibility. This means that all ministers are jointly responsible for government decisions and actions. This collective responsibility, to some extent, minimizes the criticism against the government as the blame cannot be placed on a single individual.

Statement 2 is incorrect or at best a secondary effect. While the Cabinet system does strengthen the head of government, it's not the primary purpose. The main goal is to ensure accountability and coordinated governance. The strengthening of the head of government is a consequence of the system, not its primary objective.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. Judicial review in India implies the Judiciary's power to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2. Judicial review in India empowers the Judiciary to review all legislative enactments before presidential assent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India allows the Judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws, not their wisdom.  The legislature's decision-making process is not subject to judicial scrutiny unless it violates the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Judicial review is exercised after a law has been enacted, not before. The Judiciary doesn't have the power to pre-emptively review and block legislation before it receives presidential assent.


**9. With reference to the concept of equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1. Equality implies the absence of privileges for certain sections of society.
2. The concept of equality inherently necessitates the absence of competition within society.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Equality in a society means that all individuals have equal rights and opportunities, and no specific group or individual enjoys special privileges or advantages over others.  The absence of privileges is a fundamental aspect of equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Equality does not imply the absence of competition. Competition is a natural part of a dynamic society; it can be beneficial provided it is fair and doesn't undermine the equal rights and opportunities of individuals.  Equality focuses on ensuring a level playing field, not eliminating competition altogether.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile in India.
2.  Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or modified under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Aadhaar card is a significant identity document, it does not serve as definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.  Separate processes and documents are required to establish citizenship and domicile. Aadhaar primarily establishes identity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated or modified under certain circumstances, such as if there are errors in the information or if the individual requests changes or cancellation.  The UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) has procedures for managing such situations.


**11. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly guaranteed as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has recognized the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Privacy was not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original Constitution of India.  It was through subsequent judicial interpretations and pronouncements that the Supreme Court established its fundamental nature.

Statement 2 is correct.  In several landmark judgments, the Supreme Court of India has held that the Right to Privacy is an intrinsic part of Article 21, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, and thus a fundamental right.


**12. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The electoral value of each MLA's vote is uniform across all states.
2.  The electoral value of an MP's vote in the Lok Sabha is higher than that of an MP's vote in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The electoral value of an MLA's vote varies from state to state, depending on the state's population.  A state with a larger population will have a higher electoral value for its MLAs' votes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The electoral value of an MP's vote is the same in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The formula for calculating the electoral value takes into account the population of the state and the total number of elected members in the state legislative assembly.  This ensures a balance between the representation of states and the representation of the people in the Parliament.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor of a State in any court during his term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor cannot be reduced during his term of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution provides immunity to Governors from criminal proceedings during their term of office. This protection is essential to ensure their independence and impartial functioning.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution safeguards the emoluments and allowances of a Governor, preventing any reduction during their term. This provision ensures financial security and stability for the Governor's office.


**14. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Government Assurances scrutinizes whether the assurances given by ministers in Parliament are fulfilled.
2. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines whether the powers to make regulations, rules, etc., are properly exercised by the executive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances plays a crucial role in ensuring governmental accountability by monitoring the fulfillment of assurances given by ministers in Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation is responsible for scrutinizing the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive, ensuring that these powers are used within the bounds of the law and the Constitution.  This is a key aspect of parliamentary oversight.


**15. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly automatically vacates his office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.
2.  The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly vacates his office if he ceases to be a member of the Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Speaker does not automatically vacate his office upon the dissolution of the Assembly. He continues in office until the next Assembly is constituted.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker's position is intrinsically linked to his membership of the Assembly. If he ceases to be a member for any reason, he automatically vacates the Speaker's office.


**16. If the President of India invokes Article 356 (President's Rule) in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 19 (Freedoms) is automatically suspended in that State.
2. The Parliament automatically gains the power to make laws for that State on any subject.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President's rule can lead to restrictions on fundamental rights, it doesn't automatically suspend Article 19 in its entirety.  The extent of restrictions depends on the specific circumstances and the orders issued by the President.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament's power to make laws for a State under President's Rule is not automatic and unlimited. It is limited to subjects in the State List only when a resolution to that effect is passed by both houses of Parliament.  The power is subject to constitutional constraints and is not absolute.


**17. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament of India can place any law in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.
2. Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, and this includes adding laws to the Ninth Schedule. This power, however, has been subject to significant debate and criticism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws in the Ninth Schedule were initially considered immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court can still review laws in the Ninth Schedule if they violate fundamental rights or basic structure of the Constitution.


**18. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In the first Lok Sabha, the Swatantra Party was the single largest party in the opposition.
2.  The post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was first recognized in 1969.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the first Lok Sabha, the Swatantra Party emerged as the single largest opposition party.  This reflects the multi-party political landscape of India even in its early years.

Statement 2 is correct. The formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was established in 1969.  Before that, while the largest opposition party existed, the post and its associated privileges were not formally defined.


**19. With reference to the relationship between law and liberty, consider the following statements:**

1. More laws always mean less liberty.
2. The absence of laws implies the absence of liberty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between law and liberty is not a simple inverse correlation.  Well-crafted laws can actually protect and enhance liberty by establishing order and protecting individual rights.  Excessive or poorly designed laws can restrict liberty, but the mere presence of laws does not automatically diminish liberty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Liberty requires a framework of laws to define and protect individual rights.  Without laws, there is no guarantee of order or protection against arbitrary actions, which would negate liberty.  A balance between laws and individual freedoms is essential for a just society.


**20. With reference to the "Rule of Law," consider the following statements:**

1. The Rule of Law necessitates the limitation of governmental powers.
2. People's responsibility to the government is a core component of the Rule of Law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A cornerstone of the Rule of Law is the limitation of governmental powers.  This prevents arbitrary exercises of authority and ensures that the government itself is subject to the law.  Checks and balances, judicial review, and other mechanisms are crucial for this limitation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While citizens have responsibilities within a society governed by the Rule of Law,  the core principle is the government's accountability to the law, not the people's responsibility to the government.  The focus is on the government being subject to legal constraints and not on a hierarchical relationship of responsibility.


**21. Consider the following statements:**

1.  According to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, teacher eligibility in a State is determined solely by the concerned State Council of Teacher Education.
2.  The RTE Act mandates a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) for all primary school teachers, irrespective of the State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While State Councils of Teacher Education play a role in setting teacher qualifications, the RTE Act also establishes national standards and the requirement of passing the TET.  It's not solely determined by the State Council.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTE Act mandates a TET for all primary school teachers across the country, ensuring a minimum level of qualification irrespective of the State. This is a key provision to enhance the quality of primary education.


**22. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament, while the CPCB was established through an executive order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament, giving it statutory backing and powers.  The CPCB, on the other hand, is a body established by the government through an executive order.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both the NGT and the CPCB are concerned with environmental protection, their functions differ significantly. The NGT focuses on environmental justice and adjudication of environmental disputes, while the CPCB plays a more regulatory and monitoring role in pollution control.


**23. With reference to a Money Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can only contain provisions related to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxes.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While a Money Bill primarily deals with financial matters, including taxation, it can also include other provisions that are closely related to the financial provisions. The definition of a Money Bill is fairly broad.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only make recommendations or suggest amendments within a stipulated time frame (14 days). The Lok Sabha has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power over financial matters.


**24.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The executive power of a State in India is vested in the Governor.
2. A person must have attained the age of 35 years to be eligible for appointment as a Governor.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 154 of the Constitution explicitly vests the executive power of a State in the Governor.  This power is exercised either directly or through officers subordinate to him.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution mandates a minimum age of 35 years for appointment as a Governor.  This requirement reflects the need for experience and maturity in holding such a high constitutional office.


**25. With reference to the recommendations of the Ashok Mehta Committee on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended a three-tier panchayati raj system.
2. The committee advocated for compulsory powers of taxation for Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashok Mehta Committee actually recommended a three-tier Panchayati Raj system.  Its report suggested a system with Zila Parishads at the district level, Mandal Panchayats at the intermediate level, and Gram Panchayats at the village level.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ashok Mehta Committee strongly advocated for granting Panchayati Raj Institutions compulsory powers of taxation to enhance their financial autonomy and strengthen their ability to function effectively.  This was seen as crucial for their self-governance.


**26. District Judges in India are appointed by:**

(a) The Chief Justice of the High Court
(b) The State Public Service Commission
(c) The Chief Minister of the State
(d) The Governor of the State

District Judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the High Court of the respective state.  This ensures the independence of the judiciary and prevents political interference in the appointment process.  The Chief Justice's recommendation is generally followed by the Governor.


**27. In a State Legislature, a Money Bill can be introduced only on the recommendation of:**

(a) The Speaker
(b) The Finance Minister
(c) The Chief Minister
(d) The Governor

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A Money Bill in a State Legislature can only be introduced on the recommendation of the Governor.  This is similar to the procedure at the national level, where the President's recommendation is required for introducing a Money Bill in Parliament.  This ensures that financial matters are handled with due constitutional process.

(a) Kept out of the Zila Parishad

(d) The Chairman of the Zila Parishad

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This was to ensure that the Collector's administrative role did not overshadow the democratic functioning of the Parishad. The committee aimed to balance administrative efficiency with democratic participation.

(a) Democratic decentralization
(b) Panchayati Raj institutions

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(d) Articles 356, 360, and 352

**1. With reference to the functions of the Public Accounts Committee, consider the following statements:**

1.  It examines the CAG's report on the appropriation accounts to ascertain whether funds voted by Parliament were spent within the scope of the demand.
2.  It suggests the form in which estimates should be presented to Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a parliamentary committee in India that plays a crucial role in overseeing public expenditure.  Statement 1 accurately reflects one of its core functions. The PAC meticulously examines the Comptroller and Auditor General of India's (CAG) report on the appropriation accounts. This report details how government funds, approved by Parliament, were actually spent. The PAC's role is to ensure that the expenditure aligns with the approved allocations and that there is no misuse or misappropriation of funds.  This involves scrutinizing the details of government spending, identifying irregularities, and recommending corrective measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PAC is involved in reviewing the government's financial management practices, suggesting the format for presenting estimates to Parliament is not within its purview. The responsibility of determining the presentation format of estimates lies with other parliamentary committees and the Ministry of Finance, which are responsible for the budgeting process.  The PAC's focus is on post-expenditure scrutiny and accountability.  Confusing the PAC's post-expenditure audit role with the pre-expenditure budgeting process is a common misconception.  The PAC's role is to ensure accountability after the funds have been allocated and spent, not to influence the initial budget proposal's format.


**2. With reference to the Committee on Estimates, consider the following statements:**

1.  It examines whether the money is well laid out within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.
2.  It suggests alternative policies to improve administrative efficiency and economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

The Committee on Estimates is a parliamentary committee that plays a vital role in examining the efficiency and economy of government spending before funds are allocated. Statement 1 accurately describes a key aspect of its function. The committee scrutinizes the estimates—the proposed budget—to assess whether the funds are being allocated efficiently and effectively. This involves analyzing if the proposed spending aligns with the government's stated policies and whether the planned activities are likely to achieve the desired outcomes.  The committee goes beyond merely checking for arithmetic accuracy; it delves into the value for money aspect of each proposed expenditure.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A significant part of the Committee on Estimates' work involves suggesting improvements in government policy and procedures.  Based on its examination of the estimates, the committee can identify areas where alternative policies or administrative changes could lead to greater efficiency and economy in the use of public funds.  This proactive approach helps to improve the quality of government spending and enhance public accountability.  The committee's recommendations are not binding, but they carry significant weight due to the committee's expertise and its parliamentary oversight function.


**3. With reference to the provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act on Panchayati Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates the organization of Gram Sabhas.
2.  The Act makes the reservation of seats for backward classes a voluntary provision.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 introduced significant reforms in India's Panchayati Raj system, aiming to strengthen local self-governance at the village level.  Statement 1 correctly identifies a key provision of the Act.  The Act makes the constitution of Gram Sabhas—village assemblies—mandatory.  Gram Sabhas are intended to be the foundation of grassroots democracy, providing a platform for villagers to participate in local decision-making processes. Their role extends to planning and implementation of development programmes and monitoring of government schemes at the village level.  The establishment of Gram Sabhas is a central pillar of the Act's objective to empower rural communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 73rd Amendment Act makes the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Panchayats a mandatory provision, not a voluntary one.  This reservation is aimed at ensuring that marginalized communities have adequate representation in local governance, promoting social justice and inclusive participation.   The Act explicitly requires that seats be reserved for these groups in proportion to their population in the concerned area.  Therefore, the provision is not optional; it is a crucial component of the Act's design to address historical inequalities and promote social justice.


**4. With reference to the functions of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UPSC is consulted on matters related to the reservation of posts for Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.
2.  The President of India can exclude posts, services, and matters from the purview of consultation with the UPSC.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is a constitutional body responsible for recruiting civil servants in India.  Its role is crucial in ensuring merit-based appointments and maintaining the integrity of the civil services.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UPSC is *not* consulted on matters relating to the reservation of posts for Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.  These decisions are made by the government based on policies and guidelines concerning affirmative action and social justice. While the UPSC conducts recruitment processes, the criteria for reservation are determined separately by the government to address historical inequalities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution grants the President of India the power to exclude specific posts, services, and matters from the purview of mandatory consultation with the UPSC. This power is exercised sparingly and generally in exceptional circumstances.  This provision allows for flexibility in certain situations where immediate action or specialized expertise might be needed, without the usual UPSC consultation process.  However, the President's power to exclude matters from UPSC consultation is subject to constitutional limitations and judicial review.


**5. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
2.  The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a crucial aspect of the CAG's independence and accountability.  The CAG is constitutionally responsible only to Parliament. This means that the CAG is not subject to the control or influence of the executive branch (the government).  The CAG submits its audit reports directly to Parliament, ensuring transparency and accountability in government finances.  This independent status is vital in maintaining the integrity of public accounts and preventing potential manipulation or bias in the auditing process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG does audit the accounts of State Governments, but it does not compile and maintain these accounts.  Each State Government is responsible for maintaining its own accounts. The CAG's role is to audit these accounts to ensure their accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.  The CAG's audit reports then highlight any irregularities or discrepancies found during the audit process.  This distinction between account maintenance and audit is essential to understanding the CAG's role in ensuring financial accountability.


**6. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2.  The Governor has the power to allocate the business of the government among the various Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor is the constitutional head of a State in India.  Statement 1 accurately describes a key aspect of the Governor's position. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time, although this power is rarely exercised.  The Governor's tenure is not fixed; it's entirely at the President's discretion.  This provision ensures that the Governor acts in accordance with the overall interests of the Union and does not act against the policies of the Central Government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor does not have the power to allocate the business of the government among the various Ministers.  This power rests with the Chief Minister, who heads the Council of Ministers in a state. The Chief Minister, in consultation with the other Ministers, decides the allocation of portfolios and responsibilities within the government.  The Governor's role is primarily ceremonial and constitutional; he or she does not actively participate in the day-to-day governance or administrative decisions of the state.


**7.  With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anti-Defection Law is enshrined in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India.
2.  A legislator who votes against the party line on a money bill is subject to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Anti-Defection Law, aimed at curbing political defections, is a significant feature of India's political landscape. Statement 1 is correct. The Anti-Defection Law is indeed enshrined in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India.  This schedule lays down the provisions for disqualification of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of State Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) who defect from their elected party.  The law seeks to maintain political stability and prevent the erosion of democratic principles by discouraging legislators from switching parties for personal gain or political expediency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A legislator who votes against the party line on a money bill is *not* automatically subject to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law. The law focuses primarily on defections caused by changing party affiliation or abstaining from voting in accordance with the party whip. While voting against the party line can be seen as a breach of discipline, it does not automatically lead to disqualification unless it involves a change of party affiliation or is done in violation of a specific party directive.  Money bills hold significant importance in the financial functioning of the government, and voting against the party whip on such bills warrants separate disciplinary actions within the party but not necessarily disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law.


**8. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NDC is a constitutional body.
2.  The Chief Ministers of all States are members of the NDC.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The National Development Council (NDC) is a crucial body in India's planning process, facilitating coordination between the Union and State Governments on development matters. Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is *not* a constitutional body; it was established by a resolution of the Union Government.  It does not derive its authority from the Constitution of India, unlike bodies like the Election Commission or the UPSC.  Its existence and functions are based on government decisions, making it a non-constitutional body.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chief Ministers of all States are members of the NDC.  This ensures that the Council represents the perspectives and priorities of different regions of the country.  The inclusion of Chief Ministers is crucial in the NDC's role of coordinating national development plans and policies with the specific needs and circumstances of individual states.  The NDC's composition reflects the cooperative federal nature of India's governance structure.



**9. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill.
2.  The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, is the upper house of India's Parliament.  Its powers are different from those of the Lok Sabha, the lower house.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does *not* have the power to reject a Money Bill.  While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations on a Money Bill, it cannot reject it.  The Lok Sabha, the lower house, has the final say on Money Bills, and the Rajya Sabha's role is limited to offering suggestions within a stipulated time frame.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in matters of finance and taxation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.  The Demands for Grants are part of the budget presented by the government, outlining planned expenditures. The Lok Sabha has the exclusive power to vote on these demands.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss the Demands for Grants but cannot vote on them.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling the government's purse strings and holding the executive accountable for its spending.  This asymmetry in power reflects the principle of the Lok Sabha's greater representation of the people's will.


**10. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are justiciable in nature.
2.  They aim to establish a welfare state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are a set of guidelines enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution.  They outline the socio-economic goals that the State should strive to achieve.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPSPs are *not* justiciable in nature, which means they are not legally enforceable by courts. Courts cannot issue orders or injunctions based on the DPSPs.  They are non-justiciable because they represent aspirational goals, often requiring significant policy changes and resource allocation, which are best left to the legislative and executive branches.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs does not diminish their importance; they serve as guiding principles for policymaking and social progress.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India. This means the State is expected to promote social and economic welfare for its citizens. They cover various aspects, including social security, education, healthcare, and economic justice.  The DPSPs provide a framework for the government to create policies that improve the quality of life for all citizens, particularly the vulnerable and marginalized sections of society.  The welfare state ideal is a key principle underlying the DPSPs, guiding the government's efforts towards a just and equitable society.


**11. With reference to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI).
2.  The President appoints other Supreme Court judges after consulting the CJI and other senior judges.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

The appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of India is a crucial process that ensures the independence and integrity of the judiciary. Statement 1 is correct. The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI). While the President has the formal power of appointment, the selection process usually involves consultations with the outgoing CJI and the government, leading to a consensus on the most senior and qualified judge to be appointed as the next CJI.  This convention, though not legally binding, has largely been followed, ensuring the appointment of the most senior judge to this crucial position.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The President appoints other Supreme Court judges after consulting the CJI and other senior judges.  This collegium system, though evolved through judicial pronouncements, emphasizes the judiciary's role in selecting judges based on merit, experience, and integrity.  The consultation process involves the CJI and a collegium of senior judges, ensuring a transparent and objective selection process.  This process aims to maintain the independence of the judiciary by minimizing political interference in judicial appointments.  The collegium system, while subject to ongoing debate, aims to safeguard the judiciary's independence and integrity.


**12. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial document outlining the government's financial plans for a fiscal year. Statement 1 is correct. The Department of Revenue, under the Ministry of Finance, plays a central role in preparing the Union Budget. While the entire Ministry of Finance is involved, the Department of Revenue has primary responsibility for compiling the budget documents, including revenue projections, expenditure estimates, and fiscal policy proposals.  The department works closely with other departments and ministries to gather data and formulate the budget.

Statement 2 is also correct.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government's spending is subject to legislative scrutiny and approval.  The Consolidated Fund of India is where all government revenues are deposited, and no money can be spent without the explicit approval of Parliament through the appropriation process.  This safeguard prevents the executive from spending public money arbitrarily and ensures accountability in public finance.


**13. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates that one-third of the seats in Panchayats be reserved for women.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act makes the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats a voluntary provision.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 aimed to revitalize Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India, promoting local self-governance and empowering rural communities. Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates that at least one-third of the total number of seats in Panchayats at all levels be reserved for women. This is a crucial provision aimed at promoting gender equality and ensuring that women have a significant voice in local governance.  This reservation is not optional; it's a constitutionally mandated requirement to address historical gender imbalances and empower women in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 73rd Amendment Act makes the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Panchayats a *mandatory* provision, not voluntary.  This reservation is intended to ensure that these historically marginalized communities have adequate representation in local governance, promoting social justice and inclusive participation.  The seats are reserved in proportion to the population of SCs and STs in the respective areas.  The mandatory nature of this reservation reflects the Act's commitment to addressing historical inequalities and promoting social justice.


**14. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can promulgate ordinances even when Parliament is in session.
2.  The President can return a Bill passed by Parliament for reconsideration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India holds significant powers as the head of state, but these powers are largely exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President cannot promulgate ordinances when Parliament is in session.  The power to issue ordinances is intended to address urgent situations when Parliament is not in session.  If Parliament is in session, the normal legislative process of introducing and passing Bills should be followed.  The use of ordinances when Parliament is in session would undermine the legislative process and the principle of parliamentary supremacy.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to return a Bill passed by Parliament for reconsideration. This is a form of the President's veto power.  However, this power is not absolute. If Parliament passes the Bill again with or without amendments, the President is bound to give assent.  This power of returning a Bill for reconsideration allows the President to seek further clarification or modifications from Parliament, ensuring that the legislation is carefully considered before becoming law.  This mechanism acts as a check and balance in the legislative process.


**15. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha itself.
2.  The Lok Sabha Speaker can be removed from office only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha Speaker presides over the lower house of India's Parliament and plays a crucial role in maintaining order and conducting parliamentary proceedings.  Statement 1 is correct.  The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha itself.  The election is typically held at the commencement of a new Lok Sabha or if the previous Speaker has resigned or been removed from office.  The Speaker is usually a member of the ruling party, reflecting the majority's will in the house.  The election of the Speaker by the Lok Sabha itself underscores the principle of parliamentary autonomy and the house's control over its own internal affairs.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lok Sabha Speaker can be removed from office only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha. This resolution must be moved with a notice of at least 14 days and must be passed by a majority of the total membership of the house.  This provision underscores the Lok Sabha's authority over its own internal affairs and prevents external interference in the Speaker's position.  The process of removal ensures that the removal of a Speaker is not arbitrary and needs the explicit support of a majority of the members.  This safeguard protects the position of the Speaker from undue political pressure.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising three members, including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is currently a three-member body, consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.  While the Constitution does not explicitly fix the number of members, the present structure ensures a balance of power and prevents any single individual from dominating the decision-making process.  The number of members can be changed by Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India itself is responsible for deciding the election schedule, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice or any other ministry. This independence is crucial to maintaining free and fair elections.  The Ministry of Law and Justice primarily deals with legal matters and the framing of laws, not the operational aspects of elections.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President's rule in a State:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The President's rule suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution in the affected State.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it's not an automatic consequence.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, especially if there's a possibility of forming a stable government soon. The decision rests on the assessment of the situation by the Union government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President's rule does not automatically suspend all fundamental rights in the affected state.  While certain rights under Article 19 might be suspended in specific circumstances, the entire gamut of fundamental rights is not necessarily affected. The suspension of fundamental rights needs a separate legal process, and it is usually done only during a national emergency (Article 352), not merely during President's Rule.



**3. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by asymmetric federalism, where some states have more autonomy than others due to special provisions in the Constitution.
2.  The Indian Constitution explicitly mentions the principle of "cooperative federalism" as a guiding principle for Centre-State relations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India showcases asymmetric federalism, where certain states enjoy special provisions and greater autonomy than others. This is evident in the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir (before 2019), and the provisions for certain tribal areas in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.  This reflects the diverse nature of India and the need to accommodate regional specificities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the spirit of cooperative federalism is often invoked in Centre-State relations, the Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly mention it as a codified principle. Cooperative federalism is a more recent political concept emphasizing collaboration and coordination between different levels of government.  The Constitution primarily outlines the division of powers, but the practical working of Centre-State relations involves a degree of cooperation and negotiation.


**4. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments mandate the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj institutions in all states.
2.  The concept of Gram Sabha, as a body of village residents, is explicitly mentioned in the 73rd Amendment Act and plays a significant role in local governance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Amendments aim to establish Panchayati Raj institutions, they don't mandate a strict three-tier structure in all states.  The specific structure (number of tiers) can vary based on the state's population and geographical conditions.  The amendments provide a framework, allowing flexibility for states to adapt the system to their specific needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act explicitly recognizes the Gram Sabha as a vital component of local governance in rural areas.  It grants the Gram Sabha certain powers and responsibilities, making it a key player in decision-making processes at the village level.  This strengthens participatory democracy and empowers local communities.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A private member's bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament by any Member of Parliament, irrespective of their party affiliation.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A private member's bill can indeed be introduced in either House of Parliament by any MP, regardless of their party affiliation.  This is a crucial aspect of parliamentary democracy, allowing individual MPs to raise issues and propose legislation. However, private member's bills rarely become law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these recommendations.  The Lok Sabha's supremacy in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting its role as the directly elected House of the people.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Attorney General of India is a member of both Houses of Parliament and can participate in their proceedings but cannot vote.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India (AGI) is appointed by the President and holds office during the President's pleasure.  This ensures that the AGI's advice is independent and unbiased, reflecting the government's legal position.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The AGI is not a member of either House of Parliament.  They can participate in the proceedings of both Houses, offering legal advice and opinions, but they cannot vote.  Their role is primarily advisory and legal, not legislative.


**7. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, but not the accounts of Public Sector Undertakings.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President and holds office for a term of six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier. This ensures the independence and impartiality of the office.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG audits not only the accounts of the Union and State Governments but also the accounts of all Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).  This is a significant part of their responsibility in ensuring financial accountability and transparency across the government and its related entities.


**8. With reference to the judicial review in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The power of judicial review enables the Supreme Court to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament and State Legislatures.
2. The power of judicial review is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India under a specific Article.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, which allows it to determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions. This power is essential in upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.  The court can strike down laws that violate the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the power of judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the Indian judicial system, it is not explicitly mentioned in any specific article of the Constitution. It's a power that has been developed and affirmed by the Supreme Court through its judgments, particularly in cases like Golak Nath v. State of Punjab.  The power is implied rather than explicitly stated.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act applies to all public authorities, including private bodies that receive government funding.
2.  The Act guarantees the right to information to all citizens of India, irrespective of their nationality or residency status.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Right to Information Act, 2005 applies primarily to public authorities. While some private bodies that receive substantial government funding might be brought under its purview through specific interpretations, it does not automatically include all privately funded entities.  The focus is on government transparency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act grants the right to information primarily to Indian citizens.  While there might be provisions for certain categories of non-citizens, it does not extend the right to all individuals irrespective of nationality or residency status.  The Act's focus is on empowering Indian citizens to hold their government accountable.


**10. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  The NHRC has the power to punish individuals found guilty of human rights violations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established through legislation (Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993), not a constitutional body.  While it plays a crucial role in protecting human rights, its establishment is not directly mandated by the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC does not have the power to punish individuals.  Its primary function is to investigate human rights violations, make recommendations, and advise the government.  It does not possess the judicial power to impose punishments.  The actual prosecution of offenders remains the responsibility of the judicial system.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is a constitutional body established under Article 280 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The National Development Council includes representatives from the Union Government, State Governments, and Union Territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a constitutional body.  It was established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet in 1952, not by a constitutional provision.  Article 280 deals with the Finance Commission, not the NDC. The NDC's role in planning and development is significant, but it lacks the constitutional backing of a body like the Finance Commission.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDC's composition includes the Prime Minister as Chairman, Union Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers of all States, and administrators of Union Territories.  This ensures representation from various levels of government in the process of national development planning.  Its broad-based membership is crucial for its coordination and consensus-building role.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate and pass any type of bill, including money bills, but the Lok Sabha has the final say on all bills.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a money bill passed by the Lok Sabha, but the Lok Sabha can override this rejection with a simple majority.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a money bill (only the Lok Sabha can), it can consider and amend any other type of bill. However, the Lok Sabha retains the final authority on all bills, including the power to reject amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and suggest amendments, not to veto legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a money bill.  It can only suggest amendments within 14 days, and the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept those suggestions. The Lok Sabha's decision on a money bill is final.  The Rajya Sabha's limited power in this area is a crucial aspect of the Indian parliamentary system's design.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. The Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable, meaning courts cannot directly enforce them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are not justiciable. They are guidelines for the government to strive towards, but courts cannot directly enforce them.  They represent the socio-economic goals of the Constitution, guiding the government's policy-making, but not directly enforceable through legal action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Fundamental Rights are justiciable.  They are legally enforceable rights guaranteed to all citizens, and courts can intervene if these rights are violated.  The judiciary plays a crucial role in protecting fundamental rights through various legal mechanisms, including writ petitions.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is central to the protection of these rights.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment of the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
2. The Governor's term of office is five years, but he/she can be removed by the President at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly state that the Prime Minister recommends the Governor's appointment, in practice, the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. The selection process typically involves consultations within the government, but the ultimate decision rests with the President.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor holds office for a term of five years from the date he/she assumes office.  However, the President can remove the Governor at any time before the completion of the five-year term. This power is a crucial aspect of the relationship between the Centre and the States in the Indian federal system.  The President's power to remove a Governor is not subject to judicial review.


**5. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Finance Minister is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha, and only after it is passed by the Lok Sabha is it presented to the Rajya Sabha. This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing the budget, not initiating it.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Minister is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget. This is a key role of the Finance Ministry, encompassing the formulation of fiscal policy, revenue projections, and expenditure allocation. The budget's presentation to Parliament is a significant event in India's annual political and economic calendar.


**6. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chief Election Commissioner heads the Election Commission of India,  the Commission is not a single-member body. It also includes other Election Commissioners, whose number is determined by the President from time to time.  This collegial structure is designed to ensure impartiality and prevent any single individual from dominating the election process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice President.  The Commission's role is crucial for the functioning of India's democratic system.  Its independence is safeguarded by the Constitution.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and the States.
2. The Supreme Court of India can only hear appeals from High Courts, not directly from lower courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States. This is a crucial aspect of its role in upholding the federal structure of India.  Its original jurisdiction ensures that inter-state disputes are resolved at the highest level.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court does hear appeals from High Courts, it also has the power to hear appeals directly from lower courts in certain cases, particularly those involving fundamental rights or questions of national importance.  The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is broad, encompassing both High Court judgements and, in specific circumstances, lower court decisions.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then presents them to the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India is appointed by the President of India. This appointment ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch of the government, thereby enhancing the credibility of its audit reports.  The appointment process usually involves consultations to ensure the selection of a highly qualified and impartial individual.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who is then constitutionally obligated to lay them before Parliament. This ensures that Parliament has access to the CAG's findings and can use them for accountability and oversight of government spending. The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary scrutiny of government finances.


**9. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act made PRIs a constitutional body.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in PRIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX to the Constitution, enshrining Panchayati Raj Institutions as constitutional bodies. This provided a legal and constitutional framework for the functioning of PRIs, enhancing their legitimacy and authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates the reservation of seats for SCs and STs in PRIs, ensuring their representation in local governance.  The specific proportion of reservation is determined by the state legislature, based on the population of these communities in the respective areas. This reservation policy aims to address historical social inequalities.


**10. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.
2. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor possesses the power to reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration. This power allows for a review of State legislation by the Centre, particularly concerning matters of national importance or those that may conflict with Union laws.  The President can either give assent to the bill, withhold assent, or return it for reconsideration by the State Legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Governor has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, it is not an absolute power exercised at will.  The Governor typically acts on the advice of the Chief Minister, and the dissolution is subject to certain constitutional constraints.  The Governor's power to dissolve the Assembly is a significant aspect of the relationship between the Centre and the States, and its exercise is subject to judicial scrutiny in certain circumstances.


**1. With reference to the Right to Healthy Environment, consider the following statements:**

1. It is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the Constitution of India.
2.  It is judicially interpreted as being intrinsically linked to the Right to Life under Article 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India does not explicitly mention "Right to Healthy Environment" as a separate fundamental right.  However, the Supreme Court of India, through various landmark judgments, has interpreted the Right to Life (Article 21) expansively to include the right to a healthy environment.  This means the state has a positive obligation to protect and improve the environment for the citizens' well-being.  The right to a healthy environment is, therefore, a judicially evolved right, stemming from the broader interpretation of Article 21, not an explicitly stated fundamental right.  Option (a) is incorrect because the right isn't explicitly stated. Option (c) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because the right to a healthy environment is implicitly guaranteed through Article 21's interpretation.  The correct answer highlights the crucial role of judicial interpretation in expanding the scope of fundamental rights in India.


**2. With reference to Article 275(1), consider the following statements:**

1. It mandates the provision of grants for the development of Scheduled Castes.
2. It empowers the Union Government to make grants to states for raising the level of administration in Scheduled Areas for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 275(1) of the Indian Constitution deals with grants to states for Scheduled Areas. It specifies that the Parliament may provide for the making of grants to the states out of the Consolidated Fund of India in such cases as it deems appropriate, for the purpose of raising the level of administration in Scheduled Areas for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  It does *not* mandate grants for Scheduled Castes; that's addressed under different constitutional provisions.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional provision regarding grants for Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes' welfare. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the specific focus of Article 275(1) on Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes, not Scheduled Castes.  Understanding the nuances of constitutional provisions related to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is crucial for the UPSC examination.


**3. With reference to the powers and functions of Gram Sabha under Article 243(A), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gram Sabha has the power to levy taxes and collect revenue independently of the Gram Panchayat.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of a Panchayat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 243A of the Constitution defines a Gram Sabha as a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of a Panchayat at the village level. This is a key aspect of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, aiming at decentralization and participatory governance.  The Gram Sabha does *not* have independent power to levy taxes or collect revenue; its role is primarily advisory and participatory in the decision-making process of the Gram Panchayat.  Thus, statement 1 is incorrect, while statement 2 correctly describes the composition of the Gram Sabha.  The other options are incorrect as they misinterpret the powers and functions of the Gram Sabha, which are primarily focused on providing a platform for local participation in development planning and governance.


**4. With reference to the Gandhian Principles reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principle on organizing village Panchayats directly reflects Gandhi's vision of Gram Swaraj.
2.  The principle of securing a uniform civil code is a direct reflection of Gandhi's emphasis on social unity and equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gandhi's philosophy of Gram Swaraj, emphasizing self-governance at the village level, aligns directly with the Directive Principle advocating for the organization of village Panchayats. This principle is a clear manifestation of Gandhi's vision of decentralized governance and empowerment of rural communities.  However,  Gandhi's views on a uniform civil code are complex and not unequivocally supportive. While he advocated for social unity and equality, his approach was more nuanced and didn't necessarily endorse a uniform civil code as a means to achieve that goal.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options are incorrect as they misinterpret the relationship between Gandhian philosophy and specific Directive Principles.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of Gandhian thought and its influence on the Indian Constitution.


**5. With reference to the composition of the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament consists of the President, the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha.
2. Union Territories are represented in the Rajya Sabha through nominated members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament of India, as defined by the Constitution, consists of the President, the Lok Sabha (House of the People), and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  The President is an integral part of Parliament, although he/she doesn't participate in the legislative process in the same way as the two Houses.  Union Territories are *not* directly represented in the Rajya Sabha; the Rajya Sabha's composition includes elected representatives from states and nominated members representing special interests, but not directly elected representatives from Union Territories.  Thus, statement 1 is correct, while statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the constitutional composition of the Indian Parliament.  This tests knowledge of the fundamental structure of Indian governance.


**6. With reference to the adjudication of election disputes in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India has the exclusive power to adjudicate all election-related disputes.
2.  The High Courts and the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear appeals against the Election Commission's decisions on election disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India plays a crucial role in conducting elections, but it does not have the exclusive power to adjudicate *all* election-related disputes.  While the Election Commission initially investigates and decides on election petitions, its decisions are subject to appeal in the High Courts and ultimately the Supreme Court.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 correctly points out the appellate jurisdiction of the higher courts in election disputes. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the roles and powers of the Election Commission and the judiciary in resolving election disputes.  This question assesses understanding of India's electoral system.


**7. With reference to consumers' rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Consumers are empowered to take samples for food testing independently without any legal process.
2.  Legal heirs can file a complaint in a consumer forum on behalf of a deceased consumer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While consumers have certain rights, taking samples for food testing independently without following due legal process is not generally permitted.  There are established procedures for obtaining samples and conducting tests, often involving official agencies.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, legal heirs *can* file a complaint in a consumer forum on behalf of a deceased consumer, as this is a provision under the Consumer Protection Act.  Thus, statement 2 is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the legal framework governing consumer rights and redressal mechanisms in India.  This question tests the knowledge of consumer protection laws.


**8. With reference to the office of the Lok Sabha Speaker, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Lok Sabha Speaker must be a member of the Lok Sabha at the time of election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha Speaker's tenure is not dependent on the President's pleasure; the Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha and holds office until the next general election or until they resign or are removed through a resolution of the House.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Lok Sabha Speaker must be a member of the Lok Sabha at the time of their election.  This is a fundamental requirement for holding the office. Statement 2 correctly reflects this constitutional requirement.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the constitutional provisions governing the Lok Sabha Speaker's office.  This question tests knowledge of parliamentary procedures.


**9. With reference to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Disputes between the Government of India and one or more states fall under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.
2. Disputes between two or more states fall under the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, as defined in the Constitution, includes disputes between the Government of India and one or more states.  This is a critical aspect of the Supreme Court's role in maintaining federal balance.  Disputes between two or more states also fall under the Supreme Court's *original*, not appellate jurisdiction. This is another crucial aspect of the Court's role in resolving inter-state conflicts.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is incorrect. The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the constitutional framework governing the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. This question tests the understanding of the Supreme Court's role in the Indian federal system.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduced dyarchy at both the central and provincial levels.
2. It introduced separate communal electorates for Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced dyarchy (dual governance) only at the provincial level, not at the central level.  The central government remained under the control of the British executive.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Act did introduce separate communal electorates for Muslims, a significant step in recognizing separate Muslim representation in the legislative councils.  This was a response to Muslim demands for separate representation.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the key features of the 1919 Act.


**11. With reference to the special powers of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can pass a resolution authorizing Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a Money Bill; this power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Rajya Sabha does have the power to pass a resolution to enable Parliament to legislate on subjects in the State List (Article 249).  This is a crucial power that allows the Rajya Sabha to address matters of national importance even if they fall outside the Union List.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this special power of the Rajya Sabha. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional powers of the Rajya Sabha.


**12. With reference to Parliamentary control over public finance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament has the power to reduce or reject the demands for grants.
2. The Parliament's approval is required for the withdrawal of money from the Contingency Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Parliament, specifically the Lok Sabha, has the power to scrutinize, reduce, or even reject the demands for grants presented in the Union Budget. This is a critical mechanism of parliamentary control over government spending.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, the withdrawal of money from the Contingency Fund of India does *not* require Parliament's prior approval; it is done by the President in emergencies, and Parliament is informed later.  This is a safeguard to handle unforeseen exigencies.  Statement 2 is, therefore, incorrect.  The other options misrepresent the parliamentary control mechanisms over public finance.


**13. With reference to the constitutional provisions related to education in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy contain provisions related to free and compulsory education.
2. The Seventh Schedule (Union, State, and Concurrent Lists) allocates the subject of education primarily to the Union List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV of the Constitution) include provisions related to providing free and compulsory education to all children until they complete the age of 14 years. This reflects the constitutional commitment to education.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, the subject of education is not primarily in the Union List; it's in the Concurrent List (Seventh Schedule), meaning both the Union and State governments can legislate on it, subject to certain conditions.  Statement 2 is, therefore, incorrect. The other options misrepresent the constitutional allocation of powers regarding education.


**14. With reference to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG exercises exchequer control on behalf of the Parliament during a financial emergency.
2. The CAG has judicial powers to prosecute those who violate financial laws while managing public finances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CAG's role is primarily auditing and reporting, not exercising direct exchequer control during a financial emergency.  The President's powers are invoked during such emergencies.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG does not possess judicial powers to prosecute individuals; it only submits reports to Parliament, which can then take appropriate action.  The CAG's role is to audit and report on financial irregularities.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the CAG's constitutional role and powers.


**15. With reference to the appointment of the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Prime Minister.
2.  The Prime Minister must be a member of either House of Parliament at the time of appointment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Prime Minister, but this appointment is generally based on the person who commands the majority in the Lok Sabha.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, while it is customary and expected, the Prime Minister is not constitutionally *required* to be a member of either House at the time of appointment; they must become a member within six months.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options misrepresent the constitutional process of appointing the Prime Minister.


**16. With reference to the Delimitation Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The orders of the Delimitation Commission are justiciable in a court of law.
2. The Parliament can modify the orders of the Delimitation Commission after they are presented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The orders of the Delimitation Commission are generally considered final and not justiciable in a court of law.  There are limited grounds for challenging its decisions.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Similarly, Parliament cannot modify the orders of the Delimitation Commission once they have been laid before it.  The Commission's work is to delineate constituencies, and its orders are intended to be definitive for a specified period.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the powers and functions of the Delimitation Commission.


**17. With reference to the reports that the President of India is mandated to lay before the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The President must lay before the Parliament the report of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.
2. The President must lay before the Parliament the report of the Public Accounts Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution mandates the President to lay before the Parliament the reports of certain constitutional bodies.  The report of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes is one such report.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, the report of the Public Accounts Committee is not directly laid before Parliament by the President; it is presented by the Committee itself.  The President's role is different in this context.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the President's constitutional responsibilities.


**18. With reference to a joint sitting of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A joint sitting is convened only for passing ordinary legislation.
2. A joint sitting is convened only when there is a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on a Constitution Amendment Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A joint sitting of Parliament is not limited to ordinary legislation; it can be convened to resolve deadlocks on ordinary bills and Constitution Amendment Bills.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  A joint sitting is also not exclusively convened for deadlocks on Constitution Amendment Bills; it can be convened for resolving deadlocks on other types of bills.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The correct answer highlights the broader application of the joint sitting provision.


**19. With reference to the Fundamental Duties of citizens in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Protecting weaker sections from social injustice is a Fundamental Duty.
2.  Developing the scientific temper and spirit of inquiry is a Fundamental Duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Constitution emphasizes the importance of protecting weaker sections, it doesn't explicitly list it as a Fundamental Duty.  The Fundamental Duties primarily focus on individual responsibilities and national development.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, developing the scientific temper and spirit of inquiry *is* explicitly included as a Fundamental Duty.  This reflects the constitutional emphasis on reason and critical thinking. Statement 2 is correct. The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the list of Fundamental Duties.


**20. With reference to the provisions safeguarding the autonomy of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court judges' salaries are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, making them independent of legislative approval.
2. The Chief Justice of India alone can remove Supreme Court judges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The salaries and allowances of Supreme Court judges are charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring their financial independence from the legislature.  This is a crucial safeguard for judicial independence.  Statement 1 is correct.  However, Supreme Court judges cannot be removed by the Chief Justice of India alone; a complex impeachment process is involved, requiring the involvement of Parliament. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the mechanisms ensuring the Supreme Court's autonomy.


**21. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDC includes the Chairman of the Finance Commission.
2. The NDC includes the Chief Ministers of all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Development Council (NDC) is a body that plays a significant role in India's planning process, bringing together representatives of the Union and State governments.  The Chairman of the Finance Commission is *not* a member of the NDC.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Chief Ministers of all states are members of the NDC, representing the states' interests in national planning.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options misrepresent the composition of the NDC.


**22. With reference to the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee consists of members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Committee examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts is composed solely of members from the Lok Sabha, not from both Houses.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, a key function of the Committee is to examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), scrutinizing government expenditure and ensuring accountability.  Statement 2 is correct. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the composition and functions of the Committee on Public Accounts.


**23. With reference to the principles implied in India's parliamentary government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet is headed by the Head of State (President).
2. Ministers hold office till they enjoy the confidence of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In India's parliamentary system, the Cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister, not the President (Head of State). The President is the nominal head, while the Prime Minister is the real executive head. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy is that the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) must retain the confidence of the Parliament (Lok Sabha).  If it loses this confidence (through a no-confidence motion), it must resign.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options incorrectly represent the key tenets of India's parliamentary system.


**24. With reference to the Council of Ministers at the Union level, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The Union Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Council of Ministers at the Union level is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  This is a cornerstone of India's parliamentary system.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, Union Ministers do not hold office during the pleasure of the Lok Sabha; they hold office during the pleasure of the President, although this is largely dependent on the Lok Sabha's confidence in the government.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options misrepresent the constitutional framework governing the Council of Ministers.


**25. With reference to the process of law-making in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Most important bills are proposed by private members of Parliament.
2. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in passing all types of bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Most important bills in India are proposed by the government (Council of Ministers), not private members.  Private members' bills have a lower chance of passage.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have equal powers with the Lok Sabha in passing all types of bills;  the Lok Sabha has more power in financial matters (Money Bills).  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the law-making process in India.


**26. With reference to the anti-defection law in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The anti-defection law has strengthened the independence of legislators.
2.  A legislator who defects can be disqualified from being a minister for a specified period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The anti-defection law, while aiming to curb political instability, has arguably strengthened party discipline rather than the independence of legislators.  Legislators who switch parties face disqualification.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The anti-defection law does not provide for automatic disqualification from being a minister for a specified period upon defection; the consequences are determined on a case-by-case basis by the Speaker.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the impact of the anti-defection law.


**27. With reference to the stages involved in passing a bill into law in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill must be passed by both Houses of Parliament before it is sent to the President for assent.
2. If the President does not sign a bill within six months, it automatically becomes law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A bill must be passed by both Houses of Parliament (or by the Lok Sabha alone in the case of money bills) before it is sent to the President for assent.  This is a fundamental aspect of the law-making process.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, if the President does not sign a bill within six months, it does *not* automatically become law;  the President can withhold assent.  The President's power to return a bill for reconsideration is also available.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly represent the stages of bill passage.


**28. With reference to the independence of the judiciary in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The process of appointing judges is completely free from political influence.
2. The salaries and allowances of judges are subject to the approval of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the Constitution aims to ensure judicial independence, the process of appointing judges is not entirely free from political influence.  There are established procedures, but political considerations can sometimes play a role.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The salaries and allowances of judges are *not* subject to the approval of Parliament; they are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India to ensure their financial independence.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The other options misrepresent the safeguards for judicial independence in India.


**29. With reference to the factors that can constrain judges in giving their rulings, consider the following statements:**

1. Public opinion significantly influences judicial decisions.
2.  The Constitution and legal precedents are binding constraints on judicial decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While judges ideally strive for impartiality, public opinion can indirectly influence judicial decisions, particularly in cases involving sensitive social issues.  However, it is not a direct or binding constraint.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution and legal precedents, however, are binding constraints on judicial decisions.  Judges must adhere to the law and established judicial principles.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options incorrectly represent the factors that influence judicial decisions.


**30. With reference to the appointment of judges in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The senior-most judge of the Supreme Court is always appointed as the Chief Justice of India.
2. The President appoints other Supreme Court judges after consultation with the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While there is a convention of appointing the senior-most judge as the Chief Justice of India, this convention has been broken in the past.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the President does appoint other Supreme Court judges after consultation with the Chief Justice of India; this is a key constitutional provision.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options incorrectly represent the procedure for appointing Supreme Court judges.


**31. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. They are enforceable by courts of law.
2. They aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are not directly enforceable by courts; they are guidelines for the state to strive towards.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, they aim to establish a socio-economic democracy by promoting social and economic justice, welfare, and equality.  Statement 2 is correct.  The other options misrepresent the nature and purpose of the Directive Principles.


**32. With reference to the powers of the Rajya Sabha in financial matters, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend or reject a Money Bill; it can only offer suggestions, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are incorrect.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.


**33. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. It clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.
2. It clearly defined the jurisdiction of central and provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, did not significantly address the separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature. This was a later development.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the Act did clarify, to some extent, the division of powers between the central and provincial governments, though it was not as comprehensive as later Acts.  Statement 2 is correct.


**34. With reference to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A joint sitting can be called for passing a Constitution Amendment Bill.
2. A joint sitting requires a special majority to pass a bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A joint sitting of Parliament can be convened to resolve deadlocks between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and this includes Constitution Amendment Bills.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, a joint sitting requires a simple majority for passing a bill, not a special majority.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.


**35. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.
2. NITI Aayog is a constitutional body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog was established to replace the Planning Commission; this is a well-known fact.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, NITI Aayog is not a constitutional body; it was established by a government resolution.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.


**36. With reference to the executive power of the Union of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive power of the Union is vested in the President.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the Civil Services Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Prime

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy, ensuring social and economic justice.
2.  These principles are justiciable, meaning courts can enforce them directly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Part IV of the Indian Constitution outline the socio-economic goals the state should strive for.  They aim to create a society that is both socially just and economically equitable, fostering a welfare state. While not explicitly using the term "socio-economic democracy," the principles strongly support its underlying ideals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key characteristic of the DPSP is that they are *not* directly justiciable.  This means courts cannot directly enforce them.  While they serve as guidelines for the government's actions and inform judicial interpretations of other fundamental rights, they do not themselves provide grounds for legal action against the state for non-compliance.  The courts might consider DPSPs when interpreting other parts of the Constitution, particularly fundamental rights, but they cannot be enforced independently.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs is a deliberate constitutional choice, balancing the need for social and economic progress with the limitations on judicial intervention in policy matters.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to amend Money Bills, subject to certain conditions.
2. The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the Annual Financial Statement but cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha *cannot* amend Money Bills.  It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's power over Money Bills is absolute.  This reflects the principle that control over the nation's finances rests primarily with the lower house, which is directly elected by the people.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.  This is another crucial aspect of financial control residing with the Lok Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can discuss the Annual Financial Statement (the Union Budget), it cannot vote on the individual demands for grants that constitute the budget. This ensures that the Lok Sabha retains ultimate control over government spending.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.
2.  The Act established a system of bicameral legislature at both the central and provincial levels.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive. While the Act made some provisions for the judiciary, it did not establish a clear separation of powers as envisioned in some other constitutional systems. The executive continued to hold significant influence over the judicial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 did not establish a bicameral legislature at both the central and provincial levels.  While the central legislature was bicameral (with the Council of State and Legislative Assembly), many provinces retained a unicameral structure. The Act introduced significant changes to the legislative system, but it did not uniformly create bicameral legislatures across all levels of government.


**4. With reference to the process of passing a bill in Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. If a bill is referred to a joint sitting, it must be passed by a simple majority of members present and voting.
2.  A joint sitting can be convened only for bills that have been passed by one house and rejected by the other.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. If a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it must be passed by a simple majority of the total number of members of both Houses present and voting.  A simple majority is sufficient, not a special majority.  The joint sitting is a mechanism to resolve disagreements between the two houses.

Statement 2 is correct. A joint sitting can only be convened by the President when there is a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on a bill (except a money bill). This deadlock implies that the bill has been passed by one house and rejected by the other, or substantial amendments made by one house are not accepted by the other.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Finance Commission as the primary body for fiscal planning and resource allocation.
2.  NITI Aayog is a statutory body established under a specific Act of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, not the Finance Commission. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body responsible for recommending the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the states.  NITI Aayog's role is primarily focused on development planning and policy coordination, not direct fiscal allocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog is not a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament. It was established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet.  Therefore, it does not derive its authority from a specific Act but operates under the executive powers of the government.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Executive Power of the Union of India:**

1. The Executive Power of the Union is vested in the President, who exercises it through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the National Security Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 53 of the Constitution vests the executive power of the Union in the President.  However, in practice, the President exercises this power on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.  This is a fundamental principle of the parliamentary system of government in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not the ex-officio Chairman of the National Security Council (NSC).  The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister, but this is not a constitutionally mandated position.  The composition and functions of the NSC are determined by the government, and the Prime Minister's role as chairman is a matter of convention and practice, not constitutional requirement.


**7. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and the Sixth Schedule with the administration of tribal areas in specific states.
2. The provisions of the Fifth Schedule apply to all states, while the Sixth Schedule applies only to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas (tribal areas) in several states. It outlines the powers of the Governor and the role of the Parliament in regulating these areas. The Sixth Schedule, on the other hand, deals specifically with the administration of tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It establishes Autonomous District Councils with specific powers and responsibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Fifth Schedule's provisions apply to Scheduled Areas in various states, not all states. The identification of Scheduled Areas is done based on specific criteria, and the schedule outlines the mechanism for governance in these areas. The Sixth Schedule, as mentioned, applies only to the four northeastern states listed above.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Economic Affairs is primarily responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget.
2. No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Economic Affairs plays a significant role in economic policy and budget-related matters, the Department of Revenue is the primary department responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament.  The Department of Economic Affairs focuses more on broader economic policy and management.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 266 of the Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India except under the authority of law made by Parliament. The President, as the head of state, plays a role in the process by giving assent to the Appropriation Act, which authorizes the withdrawal of funds.


**9. With reference to the custodian of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India is the custodian of the Constitution, as he/she is the head of state and upholds the Constitution's supremacy.
2. The Supreme Court of India is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, ensuring its proper application and resolving constitutional disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The President of India, as the head of state, is the constitutional head and symbol of the nation's unity and integrity.  The President swears to uphold the Constitution, and this symbolic role implies a responsibility to protect the Constitution's principles and values. However, the President does not have the power to interpret the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.  Its power of judicial review allows it to determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.  The Supreme Court’s decisions on constitutional matters are binding, ensuring that the Constitution is applied correctly and consistently.


**10. With reference to classical languages, consider the following statements:**

1.  The status of "Classical Language" is conferred by the Ministry of Culture based on specific criteria.
2.  The recognition of a language as "Classical Language" does not automatically lead to financial benefits for its development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India confers the status of "Classical Language" on languages that meet specific criteria, including antiquity, a rich body of ancient literature, and its continued influence on modern culture. The Ministry of Culture is the agency responsible for this process.

Statement 2 is correct. While the recognition of a language as a "Classical Language" is a prestigious honor and acknowledges its cultural significance, it does not automatically guarantee any specific financial aid or support for its development.  Funding for language development programs often depends on separate budgetary allocations and initiatives.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Legislative Council of a State:**

1. The size of the Legislative Council cannot exceed one-third of the total strength of the Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor of a State nominates one-sixth of the members to the Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 171(3) of the Constitution stipulates that the maximum strength of a Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) of that state.  This reflects a balance of power between the two houses of the state legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor nominates one-twelfth of the members of the Legislative Council, not one-sixth.  The remaining members are elected by various electoral colleges, such as graduates, teachers, and members of the Legislative Assembly.  The nomination provision reflects the idea of including experts and individuals with special knowledge in the upper house.


**12. With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution, reflecting the foundational goals of the Indian state.
2.  This provision is part of the Fundamental Duties, emphasizing the citizen's responsibilities towards the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The phrase "To secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" is present in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution.  The Preamble sets out the fundamental objectives and ideals that guided the framing of the Constitution.  The unity and integrity of the nation are central to these objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While upholding the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India is a fundamental duty of every citizen (added by the 42nd Amendment), the original phrasing of this aspiration is found in the Preamble. The Fundamental Duties are citizen's responsibilities towards the nation, whereas the Preamble lays down the ideals for which the Indian state was established.


**13. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayati Raj system is primarily aimed at ensuring efficient financial management and resource mobilization at the local level.
2.  The system aims to promote democratic decentralization, empowering local communities to participate in governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While efficient financial management is an important aspect of Panchayati Raj, it is not the primary objective. The system's main goal is not just financial efficiency but also effective governance and development at the grassroots level.  Resource mobilization is a tool to achieve broader developmental goals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core of the Panchayati Raj system is democratic decentralization.  It aims to bring governance closer to the people, enabling greater participation and empowerment of local communities in decision-making processes concerning their own development. This is a key aspect of strengthening grassroots democracy and improving local governance.


**14. With reference to the "Welfare State" ideal in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The ideal of a Welfare State is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution.
2.  The Directive Principles of State Policy provide the constitutional basis for the concept of a Welfare State, guiding the government towards social and economic justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Preamble mentions "social, economic and political justice," it does not explicitly use the term "Welfare State." The Preamble outlines the broad goals of the Constitution, but the specific concept of a welfare state is developed more fully in other parts of the document.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) constitute the constitutional foundation for the concept of a welfare state in India.  They direct the state to work towards social and economic justice, ensuring a minimum standard of living, providing education and healthcare, and promoting social welfare. The DPSPs outline the government's responsibility to create a society where the well-being of all citizens is a priority.


**15. With reference to the Parliamentary System of Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliamentary system in India is characterized by the fusion of powers between the executive and the legislature.
2. The Rajya Sabha's power to delay legislation acts as a check on the Lok Sabha's dominance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian parliamentary system is characterized by the fusion of powers between the executive and the legislature. The Council of Ministers, which forms the executive, is drawn from and accountable to the Parliament (primarily the Lok Sabha).  This fusion ensures that the executive is responsive to the legislature and maintains its support.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, as the upper house, has certain powers that act as checks and balances on the Lok Sabha's dominance, especially in matters of legislation. While the Lok Sabha has greater power in financial matters, the Rajya Sabha can delay the passage of non-money bills, providing an opportunity for review and debate. This helps prevent hasty legislation and ensures a more considered legislative process.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the lapsing of Bills in Parliament:**

1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses if the Lok Sabha is prorogued.
2. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses automatically if the Lok Sabha is prorogued (its session is adjourned indefinitely).  This is a significant aspect of the parliamentary legislative process.  The bill must be reintroduced in a new session if it is to be considered further.

Statement 2 is correct. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not yet been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  This is because the Rajya Sabha is a permanent house, unlike the Lok Sabha, which is subject to dissolution.  The bill will continue to be considered in the Rajya Sabha even after the Lok Sabha is dissolved and new elections are held.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment of the Chief Secretary in a State:**

1. The Chief Secretary is appointed by the Governor of the State, but the selection process usually involves consultation with the Chief Minister.
2. The Chief Secretary has a fixed tenure, ensuring stability and continuity in the administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the Governor formally appoints the Chief Secretary, the appointment is usually made after consultations with the Chief Minister, reflecting the principles of the parliamentary system. The Chief Minister, as head of the state government, has significant influence over the senior bureaucracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure.  While there might be certain norms or expectations regarding the length of service, the Chief Secretary's tenure is not constitutionally or statutorily fixed.  The government retains the power to transfer or replace the Chief Secretary at any time.


**18. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas Act, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas can hear both civil and criminal cases, promoting access to justice at the grassroots level.
2. The Act encourages the use of mediation and reconciliation to resolve disputes, reducing the burden on formal courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, empowers Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) to hear both civil and criminal cases, focusing on expeditious and accessible justice at the village level. This is intended to reduce the burden on higher courts and promote quicker dispute resolution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act explicitly encourages the use of mediation and reconciliation to resolve disputes.  This reflects a policy emphasis on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, recognizing their potential to reduce the formal court caseloads and promote amicable settlements.


**19. With reference to the Parliament's power to legislate on State List subjects, consider the following statements:**

1.  Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List only if a resolution is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority.
2.  The power to legislate on State List matters is restricted to situations of national emergency.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 of the Constitution allows Parliament to legislate on any subject in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to do so.  This resolution requires a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.  This provision reflects the exceptional circumstances where national concerns may require the Parliament to override the normal division of powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a national emergency under Article 352 does grant Parliament wider legislative powers, including the power to legislate on State List subjects, this is not the only circumstance where such power can be exercised.  The normal mechanism under Article 249 provides a separate and distinct route for Parliament to legislate on State List matters in the national interest, even in the absence of a national emergency.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding Panchayats:**

1. The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years.
2. A Panchayat reconstituted after premature dissolution continues for the remaining period of its original term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years, not 25 years as stated. This is specified in the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with Panchayati Raj institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. If a Panchayat is dissolved prematurely, the reconstituted Panchayat serves only for the remainder of the term for which the original Panchayat was constituted.  This ensures that the normal term of the Panchayat is not extended beyond its original mandate.


**21. With reference to the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposals aimed to introduce a system of dyarchy (dual government) in the provinces.
2. The proposals significantly expanded the franchise and broadened the basis of representation in the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms (1919) introduced a system of dyarchy in the provinces.  This involved dividing the provincial subjects into two categories: transferred subjects (under the control of Indian ministers) and reserved subjects (under the control of the Governor).  This represented a limited step towards self-government.

Statement 2 is also correct. The reforms did expand the franchise, albeit modestly, broadening the basis of representation in the legislatures.  While the franchise was still limited, it extended voting rights to a larger section of the population compared to previous systems.


**22. With reference to the objectives of the Preamble to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble aims to establish a secular state, ensuring freedom of religion for all citizens.
2. The Preamble guarantees economic liberty, ensuring the right to pursue economic opportunities without undue state intervention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Preamble to the Constitution aims to establish a secular state, guaranteeing freedom of religion and conscience for all citizens.  Secularism is a fundamental principle of the Indian state, ensuring religious tolerance and equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Preamble mentions "liberty" and "equality," it does not explicitly guarantee economic liberty as a separate and independent right. Economic policies and regulations are subject to the legislature's discretion, and the state's role in the economy is not explicitly limited by the Preamble.  The Directive Principles address economic justice and social welfare, but they do not guarantee complete freedom from state intervention in economic activities.


**23. With reference to the Right against Exploitation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right against Exploitation prohibits bonded labour and traffic in human beings.
2. The Right against Exploitation includes the right to form trade unions and collective bargaining.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution, which constitute the Right against Exploitation, explicitly prohibit forced labour (bonded labour) and traffic in human beings.  These provisions aim to protect vulnerable sections of society from exploitation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to form trade unions and engage in collective bargaining is not specifically part of the Right against Exploitation.  These rights are related to the right to freedom of association and the right to work, but they are not explicitly included under the specific provisions dealing with exploitation.  These rights are derived from other parts of the Constitution and laws.


**24. With reference to the nature of rights, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are claims of citizens against the state, limiting the state's power and protecting individual liberties.
2. Rights are privileges granted by the state, subject to the state's discretion and control.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fundamental rights, in particular, are claims that citizens can make against the state.  These rights limit the state's power, placing constraints on its actions to protect individual freedoms and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory treatment. This concept of rights as limitations on state power is central to constitutional democracies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Rights, especially fundamental rights, are not simply privileges granted by the state.  They are inherent rights that the state is bound to respect and protect.  The state does not have the discretion to arbitrarily withdraw or restrict these rights, which are considered essential for a just and free society.


**25. With reference to the Fundamental Duties, consider the following statements:**

1.  A legislative process is provided in the Constitution to enforce the Fundamental Duties.
2.  The Fundamental Duties are correlative to Fundamental Rights, emphasizing the citizen's responsibilities alongside their rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable.  There is no specific legislative process provided in the Constitution to enforce these duties.  They are primarily meant to guide citizen behavior and promote national unity and social responsibility.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Fundamental Duties are considered correlative to Fundamental Rights.  This means that while citizens enjoy certain rights, they also have responsibilities towards the nation and other citizens.  This reciprocal relationship between rights and duties is essential for a well-functioning society.  The duties emphasize the ethical and social responsibilities that accompany the enjoyment of rights.


**26. With reference to the relationship between Rights and Duties in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights and Duties are mutually exclusive concepts, with rights being primarily individual claims and duties being social obligations.
2.  Rights and Duties are interdependent, with the exercise of rights implying the fulfillment of corresponding duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In a democratic society, rights and duties are not mutually exclusive but are intertwined.  The enjoyment of rights often entails the fulfillment of certain duties.  For example, the right to freedom of speech comes with the duty to use it responsibly and not to infringe on the rights of others.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rights and duties are interdependent.  The exercise of a right often implies a corresponding duty.  A citizen's rights are balanced by their duties to uphold the law, respect the rights of others, and contribute to the well-being of society.  This interconnectedness is essential for a just and harmonious society.


**27. With reference to the Directive Principles added by the 42nd Amendment, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women.
2. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of providing free legal aid to the poor and weaker sections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution (1976) added several new Directive Principles, including the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women.  This principle reflects a commitment to gender equality and fair labor practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The principle of providing free legal aid to the poor and weaker sections was not added by the 42nd Amendment.  While the Constitution does promote access to justice, the specific principle of free legal aid is not directly part of the Directive Principles added by the 42nd Amendment.  Other constitutional provisions and legal frameworks address this issue.


**28. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy as limitations on state functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles act as limitations on the legislative functions of the state.
2. The Directive Principles act as limitations on the executive functions of the state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) act as guidelines for the state's legislative and executive functions.  While they are not directly judicially enforceable, they influence the interpretation and application of laws.  Legislatures are expected to consider the DPSPs when formulating laws, aiming to create legislation that aligns with the broader socio-economic goals of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs also guide the executive branch's actions. The government's policies and programs should be informed by the principles outlined in the DPSPs. While the courts cannot directly enforce the DPSPs, they can influence judicial review of executive actions by considering whether those actions are consistent with the spirit and intent of the DPSPs.


**29. With reference to the eligibility for election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. A person must be a citizen of India to contest the Lok Sabha election.
2. A person must be a resident of the constituency from which he/she is contesting to be eligible for the election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  To contest a Lok Sabha election, a person must be a citizen of India. This is a fundamental requirement for representing the Indian people in Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a candidate must be registered in an electoral roll, this does not necessarily mean that they must be a resident of the specific constituency from which they are contesting.  The candidate must meet the criteria for registration in any electoral roll in India. The requirement is primarily about citizenship and eligibility for voting, not specific residency within the constituency.


**30. Consider the following statements regarding elections in India:**

1. In Lok Sabha elections, the winning candidate must secure at least 50% of the total votes polled to be declared elected.
2. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is always from the majority party, and the Deputy Speaker is from the opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In Lok Sabha elections, there is no requirement for a winning candidate to secure 50% of the votes polled.  The candidate with the highest number of votes in a constituency is declared the winner, regardless of the percentage of votes received. This is a feature of the "first-past-the-post" electoral system used in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is usually from the majority party, the Deputy Speaker's position is not necessarily held by a member from the opposition.  The choice of the Deputy Speaker depends on various political factors and is not a rigid constitutional requirement.


**31. With reference to the Right to Vote and to be Elected in India, consider the following statements:**

1. This right is a Fundamental Right, guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
2. This right is a Constitutional Right, derived from the provisions of the Constitution but not explicitly listed as a Fundamental Right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The right to vote and to be elected is not explicitly stated as a Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution.  While it is a cornerstone of democracy and essential for political participation, it is not categorized as a fundamental right in the same way as freedom of speech or equality before the law.

Statement 2 is correct.  The right to vote and to be elected is a Constitutional Right, derived from the provisions of the Constitution that establish the electoral system and the structure of the legislature.  It is a crucial aspect of the

**1. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The number of representatives from each state is determined by the population of that state, ensuring proportional representation.
2.  The President of India nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha based on their expertise in various fields like literature, science, art, and social service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha's composition doesn't solely rely on proportional representation based on state population. While population is a factor considered in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, it doesn't guarantee strict proportionality.  Some states with smaller populations have a higher number of representatives than their population might strictly warrant to ensure representation for all states.  The aim is a balance between population representation and ensuring every state has a voice in the upper house.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India does indeed nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha. These nominations are made to ensure representation for individuals with specialized knowledge and experience in areas such as literature, science, art, and social service, which might not otherwise be adequately represented through direct elections.  This provision reflects the Constitution's intention to include expertise beyond purely political representation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha is directly elected by the people of India, making it the body that most directly represents the popular will.
2. The term of the Lok Sabha is five years, unless it is dissolved earlier by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lok Sabha, also known as the House of the People, is directly elected by the adult citizens of India.  This direct election ensures that the Lok Sabha is the most representative chamber of the Parliament, reflecting the preferences and choices of the Indian electorate. Its members are directly accountable to the people who elected them.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The normal term of the Lok Sabha is indeed five years from the date of its first sitting. However, the President can dissolve the Lok Sabha before the expiry of its term, typically on the advice of the Prime Minister. This power is an important aspect of the parliamentary system, allowing for the dissolution of the lower house if the government loses its majority support.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through the prescribed amendment procedure.
2.  The Parliament has the exclusive power to legislate on matters listed in the Union List, while the State Legislatures have exclusive power over the State List. Concurrent List subjects are legislated upon by both, with the Union law prevailing in case of conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution grants Parliament the power to amend its provisions, including Fundamental Rights.  However, this power is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations and procedures.  While the basic structure doctrine limits the extent of permissible amendments, the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is a significant feature of its sovereignty.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution divides legislative powers between the Union and the States.  The Union List contains subjects exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Parliament.  The State List details subjects exclusively under the State Legislatures' power.  The Concurrent List allows both levels of government to legislate on specified subjects. In case of a conflict between Union and State laws on a Concurrent subject, the Union law prevails. This division of powers is a key element of India's federal structure.


**4. With reference to the Indian President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Prime Minister, typically selecting the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The President can withhold assent to a bill passed by the Parliament, effectively vetoing it, but this power is subject to limitations and conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Prime Minister. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mandate this choice, convention and practice dictate that the President appoints the leader of the party or coalition that enjoys a majority in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the essence of the parliamentary system, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President possesses the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament—a form of veto.  However, this power is not absolute.  The President generally acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  Moreover, if a bill is passed again by the Parliament after being returned by the President, the President must give assent. This demonstrates the balance of power between the executive and the legislature.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the Governor in a State:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, typically inviting the leader of the majority party or coalition in the State Legislative Assembly to form the government.
2. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President, exercising a form of scrutiny over State legislation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a state appoints the Chief Minister.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly detail the process, convention and practice dictate that the Governor invites the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the State Legislative Assembly to form the government.  This ensures that the executive branch at the state level is accountable to the state legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President. This power allows for a review of state legislation from a national perspective, particularly on matters of national importance or constitutional significance.  It's a mechanism to safeguard national interests and unity.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts of law.
2.  The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by outlining the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are not legally enforceable by courts.  This is a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes them from Fundamental Rights.  While the DPSPs are significant in guiding government policy and shaping the nation's socio-economic landscape, they do not provide grounds for legal action if the state fails to fulfill them.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India.  They outline the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve to promote the well-being of its citizens.  These principles relate to various aspects of social and economic life, including education, healthcare, social security, and economic equality.  They serve as guidelines for the government to frame policies and legislation.


**7. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister.
2. The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament before it can be implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget, which outlines the government's financial plans for the upcoming fiscal year, is presented to the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister. This presentation initiates the parliamentary process of scrutiny and approval for the budget.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Union Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) before it can be implemented.  This parliamentary approval is crucial for ensuring that the government's financial plans align with the legislative will and are subject to democratic oversight. The Rajya Sabha's power is limited to recommending amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a multi-member body, currently comprising three members, including the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.
2. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections.  While originally a single-member body, it has evolved into a multi-member body. Currently, it consists of the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, ensuring a more robust and impartial electoral process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The ECI's primary function is to conduct elections for the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice-President of India.  It ensures the integrity and impartiality of the electoral process, playing a crucial role in upholding India's democratic values.



**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Equality prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2.  The Right to Freedom includes the freedoms of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Equality, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This principle is foundational to a just and equitable society, promoting equal opportunities for all citizens.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Article 19 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Freedom, which includes several crucial freedoms.  These are the freedoms of speech and expression, assembly (peaceful and unarmed), association, movement, residence, and profession.  These freedoms are essential for individual liberty and the functioning of a democratic society, although they are subject to reasonable restrictions.


**10. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats in proportion to their population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 introduced a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in India.  This system consists of Gram Panchayats at the village level, Panchayat Samitis at the intermediate level (block or taluka), and Zila Parishads at the district level.  This amendment aimed to empower local self-government and enhance participation in rural development.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 73rd Amendment Act mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Panchayats.  This reservation is proportional to their population in the respective areas, ensuring their representation in local governance and promoting social justice.


**11. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament has the power to make laws on any subject included in the State List, if it deems it necessary for national interest.
2.  The Parliament can create new states and alter the boundaries of existing states with the consent of the state legislatures concerned.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament does possess the power to legislate on any subject in the State List, if it passes a resolution declaring that doing so is in the national interest. This is a significant aspect of the Union's power to override state legislative authority in matters affecting the nation as a whole.  This power is used judiciously to address national priorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Parliament has the power to create new states and alter the boundaries of existing ones, it does not require the consent of only the concerned state legislatures. It requires a more extensive process involving presidential assent and other constitutional provisions, not simply the consent of affected states.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General of India must possess the same qualifications as are required for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India. This appointment reflects the Attorney General's role as the highest law officer of the country, acting as the government's legal advisor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Attorney General holds a high position, the Constitution does not stipulate that they must meet the exact same qualifications as a Supreme Court judge.  The Constitution only requires that they be a person qualified to be appointed a judge of a High Court.  This difference highlights the distinct nature of the Attorney General's role, which focuses on legal advocacy and advice rather than judicial decision-making.


**13. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India constitutes the Finance Commission every five years or earlier, as deemed necessary.  This regular establishment of the Commission ensures the ongoing review and distribution of financial resources between the Union and the states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential, they are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments. The government can consider the recommendations and implement them partially or fully, but it is not obligated to accept them completely. This acknowledges the government's ultimate authority in financial matters.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, and submits its reports to the Parliament and State Legislatures, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is appointed by the President of India. This appointment ensures the CAG's independence and autonomy in carrying out its crucial auditing functions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and the State Legislatures, respectively.  This ensures transparency and accountability in government finances, providing a crucial check on the executive's financial management.  The reports are vital for parliamentary scrutiny and public awareness.


**15. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
2. The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  This Act defines its powers, functions, and composition.

Statement 2 is also correct. The NHRC has the mandate to investigate allegations of human rights violations and recommend remedial action to the concerned government authorities.  It plays a vital role in protecting and promoting human rights in India, acting as an independent mechanism for redressal and advocacy.  Its recommendations, while not legally binding, carry significant moral weight and influence government policy.


**16. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on the Union Territories, consider the following statements:**

1.  Union Territories are administered directly by the President of India.
2.  Union Territories with legislatures have a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister, responsible to the Legislative Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India directly administers Union Territories that do not have their own legislatures.  This direct administration reflects the Union government's ultimate control over these territories.

Statement 2 is also correct. Union Territories with legislatures have a system of governance similar to that of states.  They have a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister, who is responsible to the Legislative Assembly of that Union Territory.  This reflects a degree of self-governance within the framework of the Union's overall authority.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the procedure for the impeachment of the President of India:**

1. The impeachment process can be initiated in either House of Parliament.
2.  A resolution for impeachment must be supported by at least two-thirds of the members present and voting in each House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The impeachment process of the President can be initiated in either House of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).  This provision reflects the importance of ensuring that the process is not controlled by a single chamber.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The resolution for the impeachment of the President must be supported by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.   This stringent requirement underscores the gravity of the impeachment process and ensures that such a step is not taken lightly.


**18.  With reference to the working of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Question Hour is a crucial part of parliamentary proceedings, allowing members to question ministers on various government policies and actions.
2.  The Zero Hour is an informal period during which members can raise matters of urgent public importance, typically immediately after the Question Hour.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Question Hour is a dedicated time slot in Parliament's daily proceedings where members can ask questions to ministers regarding government policies, actions, and administrative matters. This is a crucial mechanism for parliamentary oversight and accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Zero Hour is an informal period that follows the Question Hour.  During this time, members can raise issues of urgent public importance without prior notice. This allows for the discussion of matters that may not have been included in the formal agenda.  It's a significant part of parliamentary debate and helps keep the government responsive to public concerns.


**19. With reference to the features of the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a strong central government with significant powers compared to the state governments.
2.  The Indian Constitution explicitly mentions the division of powers between the Union and State governments through three lists (Union List, State List, and Concurrent List).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's federal system leans towards a strong central government. The Union government has significant powers, particularly in areas of national importance, and can override state legislation in certain circumstances.  This reflects the historical context and the need for national unity and integration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Constitution explicitly lays out the division of legislative powers between the Union and the States through three lists: the Union List (subjects exclusively under the Union government), the State List (subjects exclusively under the State governments), and the Concurrent List (subjects on which both levels of government can legislate).  This division is a defining feature of the Indian federal structure.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the procedure for passing a bill in the Indian Parliament:**

1. A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to a money bill; it cannot reject or substantially amend it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Money bills, which deal with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament). This provision reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role as the body that directly represents the people and is most accountable for financial matters.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Rajya Sabha (upper house) can review and suggest amendments to money bills, but it cannot reject them or make changes that would fundamentally alter their nature.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on money bills, reflecting its greater accountability to the electorate in matters of finance.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to offering recommendations.




**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to vote is explicitly guaranteed as a Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The Election Commission of India is constitutionally mandated as an independent body to ensure free and fair elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Constitution of India guarantees the right to vote, it's not explicitly classified as a Fundamental Right in Part III.  The right to vote is a Constitutional Right, derived from the provisions related to elections and representation in the Constitution.  Fundamental Rights primarily deal with basic freedoms and liberties of citizens, while the right to vote is more specifically a feature of the electoral system.  The Supreme Court has also clarified this distinction in various judgments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is indeed a constitutionally mandated body, established under Article 324.  Its independence is crucial to the functioning of a democratic system, ensuring that elections are conducted impartially and fairly.  The Constitution specifically grants it the power to supervise and control all aspects of the electoral process.  The independence of the Election Commission is a cornerstone of India's democratic framework, preventing undue influence from the executive or legislative branches.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1.  The President's power to pardon extends to all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a court-martial or for an offence against a Union law, including death sentences.
2.  The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, but the appointment process is guided by the collegium system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 72 of the Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions of punishment, or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. This power extends to all cases where the punishment is by a court-martial, for an offence against a Union law, and in cases of death sentences.  The President's power in this regard is absolute and not subject to judicial review.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, the process is significantly influenced by the collegium system. The collegium, comprising the Chief Justice of India and four senior-most judges, recommends names for judicial appointments.  The President acts largely on the collegium's recommendations, though the President's formal power to appoint remains.  The collegium system, while not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, has evolved through judicial pronouncements and conventions.


**3. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House, possesses the power to initiate a motion of no-confidence against the Council of Ministers.
2.  The Lok Sabha, the Lower House, enjoys the exclusive power to vote on the Demands for Grants presented in the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A motion of no-confidence can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, meaning it must retain the confidence of the Lower House to remain in power. The Rajya Sabha, while it can discuss and debate government policies, cannot directly bring down the government through a no-confidence motion.  This reflects the principle of parliamentary accountability, where the Lower House, directly elected by the people, holds the executive accountable.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha has the exclusive power to vote on the Demands for Grants, which are part of the Union Budget.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's control over government spending and its crucial role in financial matters. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on the demands for grants.  This distinction reflects the Lok Sabha's greater power in matters of finance.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts of law.
2.  They aim to establish a welfare state by outlining the socio-economic goals that the state should strive to achieve.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, are not justiciable. This means that they cannot be enforced by courts of law. They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate its policies and are meant to inspire the state to work towards a just and equitable society.  The non-justiciable nature of these principles is a deliberate constitutional choice, allowing flexibility in policy-making while still setting a clear direction for social and economic development.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by guiding the state towards achieving socio-economic justice and equality.  They cover a wide range of issues, including providing adequate means of livelihood, promoting education and healthcare, securing a living wage, and protecting the interests of weaker sections of society.  These principles reflect the Constitution's commitment to social justice and economic development.



**5. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Minister of Finance.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Union Budget is indeed presented in the Lok Sabha by the Minister of Finance. The Lok Sabha plays a central role in the budgetary process, having the power to discuss, amend, and approve the budget.  This reflects the principle of parliamentary control over public expenditure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  It can only make recommendations within 14 days; the Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject these recommendations.  The Lok Sabha's dominance over Money Bills reflects the principle of financial accountability to the directly elected Lower House.  The Rajya Sabha's limited role in the passage of Money Bills is a key constitutional feature.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a State:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the State.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Although the Governor's power is largely formal, the Constitution mandates that the Governor appoints the Chief Minister who commands the majority in the State Legislative Assembly.  The Governor acts on the advice of the majority party and, in practice, has no discretion in this matter unless there is a hung assembly or a significant political crisis.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. This means that the President can dismiss the Governor at any time. However, such dismissals are rare and usually occur only in exceptional circumstances such as a serious breach of constitutional norms or during a major political upheaval. The President's power here serves as a check on the Governor's actions.


**7. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Right to equality includes the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2. Right to freedom guarantees freedom of speech and expression without any reasonable restrictions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 15 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.  This is a core component of the right to equality, aiming to ensure equal treatment for all citizens regardless of their background.  However, the Constitution does allow for reasonable classification in certain circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the right to freedom, under Article 19, does include freedom of speech and expression, it's subject to reasonable restrictions. The Constitution itself lists several grounds for such restrictions, including incitement to violence, defamation, and national security.  These restrictions are crucial to maintain public order and prevent harm.  The nature and extent of these restrictions are often subject to judicial review.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Federal System:**

1.  The Indian federal structure is characterized by a rigid Constitution that is difficult to amend.
2.  Powers are divided between the Union and States through a system of three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution is not entirely rigid; it incorporates a system of amendment that allows for changes to be made, though certain provisions are more difficult to alter than others. The amendment process involves a special majority in both houses of Parliament, and in some cases, ratification by state legislatures.  The balance between flexibility and stability is a key feature of the Indian constitutional design.

Statement 2 is correct.  The distribution of powers between the Union and the States is a central feature of India's federal system.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List.  The Union List enumerates subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government; the State List covers subjects under the exclusive jurisdiction of state governments; and the Concurrent List includes subjects on which both the Union and state governments can legislate.


**9. With reference to the judicial system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in the country.
2.  The High Courts in India are established only by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country, having final appellate jurisdiction over all other courts.  Its decisions are binding on all other courts within the country and are crucial in interpreting the Constitution and ensuring consistent application of laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Parliament has the power to establish new High Courts, it does so through an Act of Parliament.  The Constitution itself provides for the establishment of High Courts and outlines their jurisdiction.  Existing High Courts are established under the provisions of the Constitution.  The Parliament's role is to legislate on aspects of their structure and functioning, but the initial establishment is not solely within the Parliament's purview.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.  This ensures the independence of the CAG from the executive branch. The CAG's independence is vital for maintaining financial accountability and transparency in government operations.  The appointment process is designed to ensure the selection of a highly qualified and impartial individual.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union Government and the State Governments. This broad mandate ensures that public funds are used efficiently and effectively at both the national and state levels. The CAG's reports are presented to Parliament and State Legislatures, providing crucial oversight of government finances.  The CAG's role in maintaining financial accountability is critical to a well-functioning democracy.



**1. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha represents the states of India with each state having equal representation regardless of its population.
2.  Members of the Rajya Sabha are directly elected by the people of their respective states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not provide equal representation to all states irrespective of their population.  The number of representatives allocated to each state is based on its population, but subject to certain upper and lower limits to prevent disproportionate representation by very populous or very small states. This system aims to balance the principle of representation based on population with the need to ensure representation for all states.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Members of the Rajya Sabha are not directly elected by the people. They are indirectly elected by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies. This indirect election method ensures a degree of insulation from direct public pressure and allows for a more considered and less volatile composition of the Upper House compared to the directly elected Lok Sabha.  The system aims to provide representation to the states as political entities, not just their populations.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Rajya Sabha:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha, but the Lok Sabha can accept or reject the amendments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to reject a Money Bill.  While the Rajya Sabha can review and make recommendations on a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha has the final say. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to suggesting amendments, but the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject these suggestions.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters reflects its position as the house of the people, directly elected and thus more closely representing the popular will concerning taxation and spending.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha can propose amendments to a Money Bill, but the Lok Sabha's decision on these amendments is final. The Rajya Sabha's power to amend is a check and balance mechanism, but it's a limited one, ensuring that the legislative process doesn't get stalled over financial matters.  The process reflects the constitutional balance between the two houses, with the Lok Sabha having ultimate authority on financial legislation.


**3. With reference to the appointment of the Prime Minister, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President appoints the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister.
2.  If no single party has a clear majority, the President appoints the leader of the coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a parliamentary system, the head of state (President) typically appoints the leader of the majority party in the lower house (Lok Sabha) as the Prime Minister.  This reflects the principle of responsible government, where the executive branch is accountable to the legislature.  The President's role is largely formal in this case; they act based on the established democratic norms and the clear mandate from the election results.

Statement 2 is also correct.  When no single party holds a clear majority, coalition governments are common in parliamentary systems.  The President, in such a scenario, appoints the leader of the coalition that can demonstrate it has the confidence of the Lok Sabha (i.e., commands a majority of seats in the house). This reflects the need for stable governance even in situations where no single party enjoys a clear majority.  The President's role here is more active, involving negotiation and assessment of political support before making the appointment.


**4. With reference to the National Development Council (NDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NDC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  The NDC plays a crucial role in coordinating the planning process between the Union and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body. It is a non-statutory body established by a resolution of the government.  Its existence and functions are not enshrined in the Indian Constitution, but rather established and governed through government policy and practice.  This non-constitutional status reflects a degree of flexibility in its operations and allows the government to adapt its role based on evolving policy needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDC is a crucial forum for the coordination of planning between the Union government and the states.  It brings together representatives from the Union and the States to discuss development policies and priorities.  The NDC's role is essential for ensuring a consistent and integrated approach to national development, particularly in a federal system where significant policy-making powers rest with state governments.  Its non-constitutional nature doesn't detract from its significant practical influence on development planning.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the President's powers:**

1. The President can refuse assent to any bill passed by the Parliament.
2. The President can return any bill passed by the Parliament for reconsideration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President possesses the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by the Parliament. This is a form of veto power, though it’s rarely exercised in practice due to the conventions of the parliamentary system.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers and typically assents to bills passed by Parliament. However, the constitutional provision granting this power underscores the President's formal role as a head of state with certain checks and balances on the legislative process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President can send a bill passed by the Parliament back for reconsideration. This power is usually exercised only once, and if the Parliament passes the bill again, the President is bound to assent. This power of returning a bill for reconsideration is another aspect of the President's formal powers, acting as a check on the legislative process and providing an opportunity for a more considered review of the legislation before it becomes law.  Again, it’s a power rarely used in practice.


**6. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India.  This reflects the constitutional framework of a federal system, where the President, as the head of the Union, plays a role in appointing key officials in the states. This also ensures a consistent approach to the appointment of governors across different states and prevents any undue influence by regional political entities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can remove the Governor at any time.  While this power is rarely used in practice except in exceptional circumstances, it is a constitutionally established check on the Governor's actions and ensures accountability to the Union government.  This provision is crucial for maintaining the unity and integrity of the nation.


**7. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights.
2. The Parliament can make laws on any subject in the State List only if a resolution to that effect has been passed by the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights. This power is subject to certain procedures and limitations, such as special majorities required for amendments relating to certain specific provisions. However, the power to amend underscores the Parliament's ultimate authority in shaping the Constitution.  This power reflects the dynamic nature of constitutional law and allows for adaptation to changing social and political contexts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State List in the national interest even without a prior resolution from the Rajya Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can pass a resolution recommending that Parliament legislate on State List matters, it isn't a mandatory prerequisite.  The power to legislate on State List subjects in national interest is a crucial aspect of the Union government's authority to ensure national unity and consistency in policy implementation, even on issues that have traditionally been within the domain of state governments.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Budget:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters, as the house directly elected by the people and thus more closely representing the popular will regarding taxation and spending. The presentation in the Lok Sabha emphasizes the importance of popular consent in financial decisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend the Union Budget.  The Rajya Sabha can only review and suggest amendments to the budget, but the Lok Sabha has the final say.  This reflects the constitutional balance between the two houses, with the Lok Sabha having ultimate authority on financial legislation. The limited role of the Rajya Sabha in budget matters is a key aspect of the parliamentary system's checks and balances.


**9. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President is elected by an electoral college consisting of only elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.
2. The value of votes of MLAs is uniform across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electoral college for the President of India includes both elected and nominated members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies. The inclusion of nominated members reflects the need for broader representation beyond directly elected officials. The weighting of votes based on population ensures that the larger states have a proportionally larger voice in the election.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The value of votes of MLAs varies across different states, based on the ratio of the state's population to the number of its elected MLAs.  This system of differential voting power is designed to balance the representation of larger and smaller states in the presidential election, preventing dominance by larger states with larger populations.  It is a complex system aiming to ensure fair representation across diverse states.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of only the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India. This appointment process ensures the CAG’s independence and impartiality. The President's role reflects the need for a neutral and independent authority to oversee government finances. The appointment is usually made after consultation with appropriate bodies to ensure the selected candidate has the necessary qualifications and experience.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of both the Union and State Governments. This broad mandate underscores the CAG’s crucial role in maintaining financial accountability and transparency across the entire country. The CAG’s audit reports are presented to Parliament and State Legislatures, thereby promoting public scrutiny of government finances. This comprehensive mandate is crucial for maintaining financial discipline and good governance.


**1. With reference to the provisions related to the Indian President, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can be removed from office only through impeachment, initiated by either House of Parliament.
2.  A resolution for the removal of the President requires a two-thirds majority of the total membership of each House of Parliament present and voting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution outlines the process of impeachment for removing the President.  It's a rigorous procedure that requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament, and the initiation can come from either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. The process involves a resolution being passed in the initiating house, followed by a similar resolution in the other house. This highlights the seriousness of the process and the high threshold for removing the head of state.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Constitution mandates a two-thirds majority of the total membership of each House present and voting to pass the resolution for the removal of the President. This is a significant threshold, ensuring that the decision is not taken lightly and reflects the broad consensus of the legislature.  This high bar is crucial for protecting the stability of the executive branch and prevents impulsive actions.


**2. With reference to the Indian Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to Parliament.
2.  No amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without prior authorization from the Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in the Union Budget process, particularly in tax-related aspects, the preparation and presentation involve multiple departments and ministries within the Union government. The Department of Economic Affairs, for instance, is involved in the formulation of economic policies reflected in the budget. The Finance Ministry as a whole oversees the entire process.  The budget's preparation is a collaborative effort, not the sole responsibility of one department.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution explicitly states that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament. This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary financial control, ensuring the legislature's oversight over government spending. This safeguard prevents the executive from spending public funds arbitrarily.


**3. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha, but it can suggest amendments.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, plays a crucial but limited role in the passage of Money Bills.  It cannot reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. However, it can make recommendations for amendments.  The Lok Sabha, however, has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The no-confidence motion, a vital mechanism for holding the executive accountable, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, the lower house. This is because the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, and a no-confidence motion tests this responsibility. The Rajya Sabha, while a crucial part of the legislative process, does not have this specific power.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution's Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by the courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a socio-economic democracy in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is that the Directive Principles are not justiciable. This means they are not directly enforceable by courts. They serve as guidelines for the state to create policies that promote social and economic welfare.  However, their non-justiciable nature doesn't diminish their importance; they influence policymaking and judicial interpretation of other laws.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, aim to create a society based on social and economic justice.  They outline the state's responsibility to promote the welfare of its citizens, including provisions related to education, healthcare, and economic equality. This reflects a commitment to a holistic approach to governance that addresses social and economic disparities.


**5. With reference to the Indian Governor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India, but he/she holds office during the pleasure of the Prime Minister.
2. The Governor has the power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India,  he/she holds office during the pleasure of the President, not the Prime Minister. This is a crucial aspect of the Indian federal system, ensuring the independence of the Governor from the central government's immediate political pressures. The President's power to remove a Governor at any time is a significant check and balance within the system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor has the power to promulgate ordinances when the State Legislature is not in session. This power is similar to the President's power to issue ordinances at the national level, allowing for swift action on urgent matters when the Legislature cannot convene. However, these ordinances must be approved by the Legislature within a specified time frame.


**6. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Although headed by the Chief Election Commissioner, the Election Commission of India is not a single-member body; it also includes other Election Commissioners. The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the President according to the need and situation.  This collegiate structure is designed to ensure impartiality and prevent any single individual from dominating the decision-making process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Election Commission of India is the constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, the President, and the Vice-President.  It plays a vital role in upholding the democratic process and ensuring the integrity of the electoral system.  Its independence is crucial for maintaining public trust in the democratic institutions.


**7. With reference to the Indian Judiciary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and the States.
2. The High Courts are courts of record, meaning their records are considered authentic and admissible in evidence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction in certain matters, including disputes between the Union government and one or more States, or between States inter se. This is a crucial aspect of its role in maintaining federal balance and resolving intergovernmental conflicts.  This power prevents escalations of disputes and ensures a neutral forum for resolution.

Statement 2 is also correct. High Courts in India are courts of record. This status signifies that their proceedings and records are considered authentic and legally binding.  This attribute is essential for maintaining the integrity of the judicial process and ensuring the enforceability of court orders.  It also strengthens the authority of the High Courts within their respective jurisdictions.


**8. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier system of PRIs in all States.
2. PRIs have the power to levy taxes and collect revenue.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act does not mandate a uniform three-tier system of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) across all states.  The structure of PRIs is flexible and can vary based on the state's needs and population distribution.  Some states might have a two-tier or even a single-tier system, depending on their specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct.  PRIs are empowered to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, and fees. This financial autonomy is crucial for their effective functioning and self-governance. This power allows them to manage their affairs independently and implement development programs within their respective regions.  This financial independence is a key aspect of their empowerment.


**9. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights.
2. The Parliament cannot curtail the powers of the Supreme Court to issue writs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament of India possesses the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights. This power, although subject to certain limitations (as per the Kesavananda Bharati case), reflects the supreme legislative authority of the Parliament.  This power allows for adapting the Constitution to evolving needs and societal changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Parliament cannot directly curtail the Supreme Court's power to issue writs, it can make laws that indirectly influence the Court's functioning.  However, any such law would be subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court itself.  The Supreme Court's power to issue writs is a fundamental aspect of its role as a guardian of the Constitution and protector of citizen's rights.  Therefore, any attempt to directly limit this power would likely be challenged and struck down.


**10. With reference to the composition of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha represents the States of India and is indirectly elected.
2.  The number of members from each State in the Rajya Sabha is equal regardless of its population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, represents the States of India, providing representation for different regions. However, this representation is indirect; members are elected by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies, not directly by the people.  This system aims to balance representation based on both population and regional diversity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The number of members representing each State in the Rajya Sabha is not equal; it varies based on the State's population.  While there is a minimum and maximum number of representatives per state, the allocation isn't uniform, reflecting the varying populations of different Indian states.  This ensures that larger states have a proportionally greater voice in the upper house.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission of India is a body with a fixed number of members, as specified in the Constitution.
2.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs plays a crucial role in determining the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not specify the exact number of members in the Election Commission of India.  While it currently functions with a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners, this number is not constitutionally mandated and can be altered by the government. The size of the commission is a matter of administrative decision and can be adjusted based on the needs of the election process.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body, is solely responsible for determining the election schedule. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does not have any direct role in this crucial aspect of the electoral process. The Commission’s independence is vital to ensure impartiality and fairness in elections.  Any interference from the executive branch would be a serious breach of this independence.


**2. With reference to President's Rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's Rule automatically leads to the dissolution of all local bodies within the affected state.
2.  The removal of the Council of Ministers is a necessary consequence of the imposition of President's Rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While President's Rule often results in significant changes to state governance, the dissolution of local bodies is not an automatic or mandatory consequence. The decision to dissolve local bodies rests with the central government, considering various factors and the specific circumstances of the state.  The central government might choose to keep existing local bodies functional or dissolve them selectively depending on the situation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Although the existing Council of Ministers is typically dismissed upon the imposition of President's Rule, it's not a definitive, legally binding consequence. The state government's functions are assumed by the central government, but the dismissal of ministers is a practical outcome rather than a constitutional requirement. The central government has the discretion to handle the situation as deemed necessary.


**3. With reference to Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indian federalism is characterized by equal representation of all federating units in the Rajya Sabha.
2.  The establishment of an independent judiciary is a defining feature of Indian federalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key aspect of Indian federalism is the unequal representation of states in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  States are represented based on their population, leading to a disproportionate representation between larger and smaller states. This unequal representation is a deliberate feature of the Indian Constitution to balance the interests of both larger and smaller states.


Statement 2 is correct. The presence of an independent judiciary is a fundamental pillar of Indian federalism.  The judiciary plays a vital role in resolving disputes between the central government and state governments, ensuring the balance of power and upholding the federal structure. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is crucial in safeguarding the constitutional framework of federalism.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament of India utilizes only the Question Hour mechanism to exercise control over the Council of Ministers.
2.  The Adjournment Motion is a parliamentary tool exclusively used for discussing matters of urgent public importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Parliament employs several mechanisms to hold the Council of Ministers accountable, including the Question Hour, debates on the budget and other bills, no-confidence motions, and adjournment motions. The Question Hour is a significant tool, but it is not the sole mechanism for parliamentary oversight of the executive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While adjournment motions are primarily used to discuss urgent matters, their application is not limited exclusively to issues of urgent public importance.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the discretion to determine the admissibility of such motions, considering various factors. Their use is subject to the rules and procedures of Parliament.


**5. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes the exercise of rule-making powers by the executive.
2. The Committee on Government Assurances monitors the implementation of assurances given by ministers on the floor of the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation in the Indian Parliament plays a crucial role in overseeing the executive branch's exercise of delegated legislative power.  This committee examines whether the executive is using its rule-making powers within the scope of the authority granted by Parliament. The committee's scrutiny helps prevent executive overreach and ensures that delegated legislation aligns with the principles of parliamentary democracy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Committee on Government Assurances is responsible for tracking the implementation of assurances given by ministers in Parliament.  This committee ensures that the government keeps its promises and commitments made to the House. It investigates the progress of these assurances and reports its findings to Parliament, fostering government accountability and transparency.



**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of "Judicial Review" empowers the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2.  "Judicial Review" solely pertains to the power of the judiciary to pronounce on the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While judicial review involves examining the legality of laws and actions, it doesn't extend to questioning the wisdom or policy considerations behind them. The judiciary's role is to assess whether a law or action conforms to the Constitution, not to judge the effectiveness or appropriateness of the policy itself. This distinction safeguards the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature.

Statement 2 is correct. The core function of judicial review is to determine the constitutionality of laws and executive actions.  The judiciary's power to strike down laws or actions that violate the Constitution is a fundamental aspect of judicial review. This ensures that the government operates within the bounds of the Constitution and protects fundamental rights.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In India, the right to vote is a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The right to be elected in India is considered a natural right inherent to every citizen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The right to vote is a fundamental right enshrined in the Indian Constitution under Part III, specifically related to the right to equality. This right is essential for the functioning of a democratic system and ensures that citizens have a voice in electing their representatives.  The Constitution protects this right from infringement by the government or any other entity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to be elected is not a natural right. While citizenship grants certain rights and freedoms, the right to be elected is a constitutional right, subject to qualifications and procedures laid down by law.  It is not an inherent, inalienable right existing independently of legal frameworks.  A person must fulfill specific criteria to be eligible for election, such as age, citizenship, and other legal requirements.


**8. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is a result of an agreement among the federating units.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India is clearly defined.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike some federations that emerge from an agreement among constituent states, the Indian federal structure was established by a single constitutional document. The Constitution of India created the federation, not an agreement among pre-existing entities. While there were negotiations and debates during the drafting of the Constitution, it was ultimately imposed, not agreed upon.

Statement 2 is correct. A defining feature of Indian federalism is the clear division of powers between the Union and the States. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the three lists—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List—specifying which subjects fall under the jurisdiction of the Centre, the States, or both. This division of powers is crucial for maintaining the balance of power and preventing encroachment by either the Centre or the States.


**9. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Local self-government can be best described as a process of administrative delegation.
2.  Democratic decentralization is a core principle underlying the concept of local self-government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While local self-government involves delegation of certain administrative powers to local bodies, it's not merely a process of administrative delegation.  It is much broader and more significant than that, representing a transfer of power and decision-making authority to local communities.  Local self-government aims to empower local communities to manage their affairs and participate in governance.

Statement 2 is correct. Democratic decentralization is the foundational principle behind local self-government. It aims to bring governance closer to the people, ensuring their meaningful participation in decision-making processes that affect their lives.  This principle empowers local communities and strengthens grassroots democracy.


**10. With reference to the Parliament's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. Supplementary questions are a crucial tool for Parliament to seek clarifications and details from Ministers.
2. The Adjournment Motion is primarily used by the Parliament to express its disapproval of government policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Supplementary questions are an integral part of the Question Hour in Parliament.  They allow members to delve deeper into the answers provided by ministers, seeking clarifications, additional information, and details on specific aspects.  This mechanism helps ensure transparency and accountability in government functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Adjournment Motion can be used to express disapproval, it primarily serves as a tool to discuss urgent matters of public importance. It is not specifically designed for expressing disapproval of government policies; other parliamentary procedures are better suited for that purpose. The Adjournment Motion's primary function is to bring attention to urgent issues that require immediate parliamentary debate.



**11. With reference to Private Member's Bills in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill can only be introduced by a nominated member of Parliament.
2.  Private member's bills have never been passed in the history of the Indian Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A private member's bill can be introduced by any Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a minister.  It is not restricted to nominated members.  Any MP, whether elected or nominated, who is not a minister, can introduce a private member's bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While private member's bills are less frequently passed than government bills, they have been passed on several occasions in the history of the Indian Parliament. Although rare, it is possible for a private member's bill to successfully complete the legislative process and become law.  The passage of such bills demonstrates that private members can contribute to law-making in India.


**12.  Consider the following statements:**

1.  In the parliamentary form of government, the executive and legislature function independently.
2.  The main advantage of the parliamentary system is the executive's responsibility to the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A core feature of the parliamentary system is the close relationship between the executive and the legislature.  The executive branch (the government) is drawn from and accountable to the legislature (Parliament).  They do not function entirely independently; instead, the executive's actions are subject to the legislature's scrutiny and control.

Statement 2 is correct. The executive's accountability to the legislature is a key strength of the parliamentary system.  The government's ability to govern effectively depends on maintaining the confidence of the legislature.  This accountability mechanism helps prevent executive overreach and ensures that the government acts in accordance with the will of the people's representatives.


**13. With reference to the Cabinet form of Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet form of Government is primarily a mechanism to expedite government activities.
2.  The Cabinet form of Government is a mechanism of parliamentary democracy to ensure collective responsibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While efficiency is a desirable outcome of the Cabinet form of Government, it is not the primary objective. The Cabinet form of Government is primarily designed to ensure collective responsibility and coordinated decision-making.  Efficiency is a consequence of the system's structure and functioning, not its core purpose.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cabinet form of Government, a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy, is designed to ensure that the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the legislature.  This means that the entire Cabinet is accountable for government policies and actions.  Collective responsibility enhances government stability and prevents individual ministers from acting unilaterally.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Equality in society necessarily implies the absence of competition.
2.  One implication of equality is the absence of privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Equality in society does not preclude competition.  Competition can exist even in a society striving for equality, provided it's fair and just.  Equality focuses on equal opportunities and fair treatment, not the elimination of competition altogether.  A competitive environment can be compatible with principles of equality, as long as the rules of competition are fair and equitable.

Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental aspect of equality is the absence of privileges.  Privileges grant unfair advantages to certain individuals or groups, undermining the principle of equal treatment.  Equality demands that all individuals have equal rights and opportunities, without any special advantages based on factors such as birth, wealth, or social status.  The elimination of privileges is essential for creating a truly egalitarian society.


**15. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act vested residuary powers in the Federal Legislature.
2.  The Act established a federation based on a clear division of powers between the Centre and the Provinces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1935, vested residuary powers in the Governor-General. This meant that any powers not explicitly assigned to the federal or provincial legislatures remained with the Governor-General, reflecting a centralized tendency within the federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Government of India Act 1935 is notable for establishing a federal structure in India, albeit with a strong central bias. While not perfectly balanced, the Act did attempt to define the division of powers between the Centre and the Provinces, laying the groundwork for future constitutional developments.  It introduced a system of federal governance, even though the balance of power leaned heavily towards the Centre.


**16.  Consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar card serves as conclusive proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2.  Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Aadhaar card is a proof of identity and address, but it does not serve as conclusive proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes, while domicile is established through different legal and administrative procedures.  Aadhaar is a biometric identification system and not a document determining citizenship or domicile.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aadhaar numbers are intended to be permanent, they are not immutable. Under certain circumstances, an Aadhaar number can be deactivated or updated.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has provisions for deactivation or correction of Aadhaar data if errors are found or if there are legitimate reasons for such actions. The UIDAI has mechanisms in place to address issues and correct errors related to Aadhaar data.


**17. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has upheld the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Right to Privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  However, the Supreme Court of India has recognized and upheld this right as an intrinsic part of other fundamental rights, particularly the Right to Life and Personal Liberty.

Statement 2 is correct. In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of India recognised the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.  The Court ruled that the right to privacy is an integral part of Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  This judgment significantly expanded the scope of fundamental rights in India.


**18. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The value of each Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA)'s vote is uniform across all states.
2.  The value of a vote of a Member of Parliament (MP) from the Lok Sabha is higher than that of an MP from the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The value of each MLA's vote in the presidential election varies from state to state.  This value is calculated based on the state's population and is not uniform.  The formula for calculating the value of an MLA's vote takes into account the state's population and its representation in the Lok Sabha.  Larger states have MLAs with higher vote values.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The value of an MP's vote in the presidential election does not differ between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs have the same value of vote, reflecting the principle of equal representation in the presidential electoral college.  This ensures that both houses of Parliament have equal weight in the presidential election.


**19. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor of a State during his term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor cannot be reduced during his term of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Governor of a State enjoys immunity from criminal proceedings during his term of office. This protection applies to both official and personal acts.  This immunity is designed to safeguard the independence and impartiality of the Governor's office and prevent any undue influence or pressure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The emoluments and allowances of a State Governor are protected from reduction during his term.  This provision ensures the financial security of the Governor and prevents any attempts to influence his decisions through financial means.  This protection is essential for maintaining the dignity and independence of the Governor's office.


**20. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rules Committee is responsible for scrutinizing and reporting on the exercise of rule-making powers by the Executive.
2. The Business Advisory Committee is primarily concerned with the allocation of time for legislative business in the House.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rules Committee is responsible for the smooth functioning of the House. It deals with matters related to the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the House but does not scrutinize the Executive's exercise of rule-making powers. That is the responsibility of the Committee on Subordinate Legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Business Advisory Committee's primary function is to allocate time to various legislative items.  This committee helps ensure that the Parliament's time is used effectively and efficiently, facilitating the smooth progress of legislative business.  It plays a crucial role in the scheduling and management of parliamentary proceedings.


**21. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly automatically vacates his office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.
2.  The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly vacates his office if he ceases to be a member of the Assembly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly does not automatically vacate his office upon the dissolution of the Assembly.  While the Assembly's dissolution necessitates a new election for the Speaker after the next Assembly is formed, the incumbent Speaker's term does not end immediately. The Speaker continues in office until the newly elected Assembly chooses a new Speaker.

Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental requirement for holding the office of Speaker is membership in the Legislative Assembly. If a Speaker ceases to be a member of the Assembly (e.g., through resignation, disqualification, or defeat in an election), he automatically vacates his office as Speaker. This ensures that the Speaker always remains a member of the body he presides over.



**22. With reference to Article 356 of the Indian Constitution (President's Rule), consider the following statements:**

1.  The imposition of President's Rule automatically suspends Article 19 (fundamental rights related to freedom of speech, assembly, etc.) in the affected State.
2.  The imposition of President's Rule empowers the Parliament to exercise the legislative powers of the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The imposition of President's Rule does not automatically suspend Article 19 in the affected State. While the central government assumes the State's executive functions, the suspension of fundamental rights is a separate process that requires specific legal justification.  The government would need to justify the suspension of these rights based on specific circumstances, using proper legal procedures.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of President's Rule is that the Parliament can exercise the legislative powers of the State Legislature.  This power allows the central government to enact laws for the State when its own legislature is unable to function effectively.  This provision is crucial for maintaining governance and stability during periods of constitutional emergency in a State.


**23. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament of India can place any law within the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  Once a law is included in the Ninth Schedule, its validity cannot be challenged in any court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. This power was intended to protect certain land reforms and other laws from judicial review.  However, this power has been used extensively, sometimes raising concerns about its potential for undermining judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Ninth Schedule was initially intended to provide immunity from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws included in the Ninth Schedule are not completely immune from judicial scrutiny.  The Court can still review the constitutionality of such laws, particularly if they violate fundamental rights or other basic constitutional principles.  The Supreme Court has limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection from judicial review.


**24. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swatantra Party was the single largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.
2. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was first formally recognized in 1969.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Swatantra Party emerged as the single largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.  This party played a significant role in the early years of Indian parliamentary democracy, providing a voice for those who held different views from the ruling Congress Party.

Statement 2 is also correct. The formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha began in 1969.  Before this, the role of the leader of the largest opposition party was not officially recognized.  The formalization of this position enhanced the role of the opposition in Parliament and strengthened the system of checks and balances.


**25.  Consider the following statements:**

1. More laws necessarily imply less liberty.
2.  The absence of laws implies the absence of liberty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between laws and liberty is not a simple inverse proportion.  While excessive or unjust laws can restrict liberty, a well-structured legal framework is essential for protecting and ensuring liberty.  Laws can both protect and restrict liberty depending on their nature and how they are applied.  The quality and fairness of laws are crucial determinants of liberty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The absence of laws does not necessarily mean the absence of liberty.  In fact, it can lead to anarchy and insecurity, which severely threaten liberty.  Laws are important for maintaining order and protecting individual rights, which are essential components of liberty.  A legal framework is needed to guarantee liberty and prevent its erosion through chaos or tyranny.


**26. With reference to the Rule of Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rule of Law necessitates the limitation of governmental powers.
2.  People's responsibility to the government is a central tenet of the Rule of Law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core principle of the Rule of Law is the limitation of governmental powers.  This principle ensures that the government operates within the bounds of the law and does not exercise arbitrary or unchecked authority.  The limitation of governmental powers is crucial for protecting individual rights and preventing tyranny.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While responsible citizenship is important for a well-functioning society governed by the Rule of Law, the Rule of Law primarily focuses on the government's accountability to the law, not the people's responsibility to the government. The Rule of Law emphasizes the government's subjection to the law, not the people's subordination to the government.  The focus is on the government's accountability, not citizen's responsibility.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Education (RTE) Act:**

1.  The RTE Act mandates that a person must pass the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) to teach primary classes.
2.  The RTE Act stipulates that the minimum qualification for teacher appointments in a state is determined by the respective State Council of Teacher Education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTE Act mandates that for teaching primary classes, a candidate must pass the TET.  This requirement aims to ensure a minimum standard of teaching competency in primary schools.  The TET is a crucial component of the RTE Act's efforts to improve the quality of primary education.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RTE Act designates the State Council of Teacher Education as the authority to determine the minimum qualification for teacher appointments in a state.  This allows states to adapt the requirements to their specific circumstances while maintaining a national standard for teacher training.  The State Councils have the authority to set minimum qualification standards, ensuring that teachers possess the necessary knowledge and skills.


**28. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NGT and the CPCB are both established through Acts of Parliament.
2.  The NGT's primary function is to provide environmental justice, while the CPCB's focus is on pollution control and monitoring.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament (National Green Tribunal Act, 2010), while the CPCB was established through an executive order of the government.  The NGT's establishment through legislation underscores its judicial role, while the CPCB's creation through executive order reflects its administrative function.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT's primary focus is on providing environmental justice and reducing the burden on higher courts.  The CPCB, on the other hand, plays an administrative role, focusing on pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement.  The NGT's judicial role complements the CPCB's administrative and monitoring functions in environmental protection.


**29. With reference to Money Bills, consider the following statement:**

A bill is deemed a Money Bill if it contains only provisions exclusively related to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax.

Which of the following options is correct regarding the above statement?

(a) The statement is completely correct.
(b) The statement is partially correct.
(c) The statement is completely incorrect.
(d) The statement is misleading.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement is partially correct. While a bill containing *only* provisions related to taxation would be considered a Money Bill, the definition of a Money Bill is broader than that.  A Money Bill can also include provisions related to the borrowing of money or the custody of the Consolidated Fund of India.  The statement correctly identifies one aspect of a Money Bill but fails to encompass the entire definition.  A Money Bill can include provisions beyond just taxation.




**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and, as per the Constitution's provisions, up to two other Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the President of India, on the advice of the CEC.  The CEC is the head of the ECI and has overriding authority over the other Election Commissioners.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India itself, and not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice,  decides the election schedule for both general and by-elections. The ECI enjoys complete autonomy in this matter, ensuring its impartiality and independence. The Ministry of Law and Justice plays no role in the scheduling of elections.  The ECI's independence is crucial to the fairness and credibility of the electoral process.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding President's rule in a state:**

1. The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the state legislative assembly.
2. The President's rule suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution in the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule under Article 356 often leads to the dissolution of the state legislative assembly, it's not automatic. The President can choose to keep the assembly in session if deemed necessary.  The decision to dissolve the assembly rests with the President, based on advice from the central government, and is a discretionary power that can be exercised depending on the specific circumstances of the state's political situation.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's rule does not automatically suspend fundamental rights in the affected state.  While the central government assumes control of the state's administration during President's rule, fundamental rights are not suspended unless specific provisions are invoked under the Constitution, such as during a National Emergency (Article 352) which has separate and distinct conditions for invocation.  The preservation of fundamental rights is a cornerstone of Indian democracy, even under extraordinary circumstances like President's rule.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal system is characterized by a rigid constitution that cannot be amended easily.
2. The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States in India is based on a clear-cut division of powers with no overlapping jurisdictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution is not rigid; it allows for amendments through a relatively flexible process.  While some amendments require a special majority and ratification by states, the process is not so difficult as to be considered completely inflexible. The Constitution's flexibility allows for adaptation to changing circumstances and societal needs.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian federal system does not adhere to a strict division of powers. The Constitution includes provisions for concurrent lists, where both the Centre and the States have legislative power.  Furthermore, there are instances of overlapping jurisdictions and the Centre's power extends over certain areas, such as the administration of Union Territories and the power to intervene in State matters under certain conditions. This flexibility is essential for the smooth functioning of a diverse nation.


**4. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament of India can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a simple majority vote.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Parliament of India can amend the Constitution, but it doesn't require merely a simple majority for all amendments.  Certain provisions, especially those related to the basic structure of the Constitution, require a special majority and, in some cases, ratification by state legislatures.  The process of constitutional amendment is designed to ensure that changes are made thoughtfully and not arbitrarily.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does not have the power to reject a Money Bill. While it can suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha (House of the People) has the final say and can accept or reject those suggestions. The Lok Sabha's dominance in matters of finance is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to scrutinize and review, but not to veto financial legislation.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Indian Judicial System:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can only hear cases that involve disputes between the Centre and the States.
2. The High Courts in India have original, appellate, and advisory jurisdictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court of India's original jurisdiction extends beyond disputes between the Centre and States. It can also hear cases involving fundamental rights, disputes between the Centre and one or more States, and disputes between the Government of India and any State or States. Its appellate and advisory jurisdictions are even broader. The Supreme Court's wide-ranging jurisdiction reflects its role as the apex court of the Indian judicial system.


Statement 2 is correct. High Courts in India possess original, appellate, and advisory jurisdictions.  Original jurisdiction refers to the power to hear cases first, appellate jurisdiction is the power to review decisions from lower courts, and advisory jurisdiction is the power to give opinions on questions of law referred to it by the government or other authorized bodies.  This broad range of powers ensures that High Courts are central to the administration of justice within their respective states.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning that they can be enforced through the courts.
2. The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPSPs are not justiciable; they are not legally enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to frame its policies and legislation to promote social and economic justice.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs reflects the Constitution's recognition that the state may require flexibility in addressing complex socio-economic issues and achieving long-term goals.


Statement 2 is correct. The DPSPs are aimed at establishing a welfare state in India.  They outline the social and economic goals that the state should strive to achieve, including providing social security, promoting education, protecting workers' rights, and ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens.  The DPSPs represent the Constitution's commitment to social justice and the improvement of the living standards of all citizens.


**7. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the State, irrespective of whether the Chief Minister commands a majority in the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor formally appoints the Chief Minister, it's a constitutional convention that the person who commands a majority in the State Legislative Assembly is appointed.  The Governor's discretion in this matter is limited, and deviating from this convention would be highly unusual and likely to lead to political instability.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President of India. This power is primarily used for bills that have significant implications for national interests or those that might be unconstitutional.  The reservation of bills is a mechanism to ensure that the Centre has a say in matters of importance to the nation as a whole.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Union Budget in India:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously.
2. The Finance Commission is responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha (House of the People), and only after its consideration in the Lok Sabha is it presented to the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater authority in financial matters.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Finance Minister and the Department of Revenue are responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget to Parliament. The Finance Commission's role is distinct; it is responsible for making recommendations to the President on the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and the States.  The two bodies have different roles and responsibilities in the financial system.


**9. With reference to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Equality prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
2. The Right to Constitutional Remedies allows citizens to approach the courts for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 15 of the Indian Constitution, under the Right to Equality, explicitly prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.  This principle is fundamental to the establishment of a just and equitable society.


Statement 2 is correct. Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, under the Right to Constitutional Remedies, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights. This right is considered the 'heart and soul' of the Constitution, empowering citizens to seek judicial redressal for violations of their fundamental rights.  This provision underscores the importance of judicial review in upholding the Constitution.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG is appointed by the President of India and holds office for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  This ensures the CAG's independence and impartiality, which is critical to their role in auditing government accounts.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments. This broad mandate reflects the CAG's importance in ensuring financial accountability across all levels of government.  The CAG's reports are presented to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively, ensuring transparency and public scrutiny of government finances.


**11. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of three-tier PRIs in all states.
2. The PRIs are empowered to levy taxes and collect fees within their respective jurisdictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act does not mandate a three-tier system of PRIs in all states.  The structure of PRIs is left to the discretion of individual states, depending on their geographical and demographic characteristics.  States may choose to have a three-tier, two-tier, or even a single-tier system of PRIs.


Statement 2 is correct. The PRIs are empowered to levy taxes and collect fees within their respective jurisdictions.  This financial autonomy is essential to enable them to function effectively and carry out their responsibilities.  The specific taxes and fees that PRIs can levy are determined by state legislation, subject to the provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act.


**12.  Consider the following statements regarding the features of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Indian Constitution incorporates elements of both federal and unitary systems of government.
2. The Indian Constitution is based on a written document and not on conventions and precedents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Constitution is a blend of federal and unitary features. While it establishes a federal structure with a division of powers between the Centre and States, it also incorporates several unitary elements, such as the power of the Centre to intervene in State matters and the single citizenship provision.  This unique blend is designed to accommodate the diversity and complexity of the Indian nation.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Indian Constitution is primarily based on a written document, it also incorporates several conventions and precedents that are not explicitly mentioned in the written text.  These unwritten aspects of the Constitution evolve over time and shape the functioning of the government and its various institutions.  The interplay between written provisions and unwritten conventions is a characteristic feature of the Indian constitutional system.


**13. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act guarantees the right to information to all citizens, regardless of their citizenship status.
2. The RTI Act mandates that all public authorities must proactively disclose certain categories of information.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act, 2005 grants the right to information to Indian citizens only.  While the scope of the Act aims to promote transparency and accountability, it is not applicable to non-citizens.  The limitation on citizenship is a key aspect of the Act's design and reflects the focus on domestic transparency and accountability.


Statement 2 is correct. The RTI Act mandates that public authorities must proactively disclose certain categories of information.  This proactive disclosure is meant to enhance transparency and reduce the need for citizens to file individual requests for information.  The categories of information that must be proactively disclosed are specified in the Act and aim to provide citizens with access to key government data and activities.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the process of amending the Indian Constitution:**

1. An amendment to the Constitution can be initiated by introducing a bill in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. The President of India has the power to veto a constitutional amendment bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A constitutional amendment bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  Once introduced, it follows the same process as other bills, involving readings, debates, and voting in both Houses. The flexibility in initiating the amendment process in either House reflects the principle of legislative equality between the two Houses.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India does not have the power to veto a constitutional amendment bill.  While the President has the power to assent to or withhold assent to ordinary bills, this power does not extend to constitutional amendment bills.  Once a constitutional amendment bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament with the required majority, it becomes law upon the President's assent.  The President's role is essentially a formal one in this process.


**15. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
2. The NHRC has the power to summon and enforce the attendance of any person and examine him on oath.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  Its establishment reflects India's commitment to protecting human rights and providing a mechanism for investigating allegations of human rights violations.


Statement 2 is correct. The NHRC has the power to summon and enforce the attendance of any person and examine them on oath.  This power is essential for the NHRC to conduct effective investigations into human rights violations.  The Commission's investigative powers are designed to ensure that it can gather the necessary evidence to determine whether human rights violations have occurred and to make recommendations for redressal.


**1. With reference to the right to vote and to be elected in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  This right is explicitly guaranteed as a fundamental right under Part III of the Constitution.
2.  The exercise of this right is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law, such as age limits and eligibility criteria.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the right to vote is a crucial aspect of democratic participation, it's not explicitly classified as a fundamental right in the same way as, for example, freedom of speech or religion.  The Constitution of India does not define the right to vote as a fundamental right, although it is a cornerstone of the democratic process and is enshrined in the Constitution.  The right to vote is a constitutional right, derived from the structure and principles of the Constitution, rather than being explicitly listed as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct.  The right to vote, although a fundamental aspect of a democracy, is not absolute.  The Constitution and subsequent laws establish reasonable restrictions, such as minimum age requirements (18 years),  and provisions for disqualification based on factors such as criminal convictions.  These restrictions aim to maintain the integrity and fairness of the electoral process.  The Supreme Court has upheld the legality of these restrictions as justifiable limitations on the right to vote.


**2. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission is a multi-member body, with a Chief Election Commissioner and a variable number of Election Commissioners appointed by the President.
2.  The Union Ministry of Law and Justice is primarily responsible for deciding the election schedule for both general and by-elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is not a fixed five-member body. While it always includes a Chief Election Commissioner, the number of Election Commissioners can vary, depending on the needs of the ECI.  The President of India appoints the CEC and other Election Commissioners.  The number of Election Commissioners can be increased or decreased by the President on the advice of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), not the Ministry of Law and Justice, plays a significant role in the election process.  However, the Election Commission of India itself is the ultimate authority on deciding the election schedule.  The MHA provides logistical support and facilitates the process, but the ECI's independence is constitutionally protected. The election schedule is announced by the Election Commission.


**3. With reference to the proclamation of President's Rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly is an automatic consequence of the imposition of President's Rule.
2.  The removal of the State Council of Ministers is a necessary prerequisite for the imposition of President's Rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the State Legislative Assembly is often dissolved when President's Rule is imposed, it's not an automatic consequence.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, especially if there's a possibility of restoring normalcy relatively quickly.  The decision to dissolve the Assembly is a matter of political judgment and expediency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The removal of the State Council of Ministers usually precedes or accompanies the imposition of President's Rule, but it's not a strict prerequisite.  The President's Rule is imposed due to a breakdown of constitutional machinery, and the removal of the council is a consequence of this breakdown. However, the President's Rule is not exclusively because of the removal of the Council of Ministers.


**4. With reference to Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian federal system is characterized by a highly centralized structure, with significant power concentrated at the Union level.
2.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and the States is primarily based on a written agreement among the federating units at the time of Independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian federal system, while having features of both federalism and unitary systems, is often described as a quasi-federal system.  The Union government possesses considerable power, especially in areas like defense, foreign affairs, and currency, and has the power to intervene in state matters under various circumstances (e.g., Article 356).  The states have significant autonomy within their assigned domains but are ultimately subordinate to the Centre.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Indian federal system is not based on a written agreement among the federating units.  The Constitution of India, drafted by the Constituent Assembly, established the framework for the distribution of powers between the Centre and States.  The Constitution itself serves as the fundamental agreement outlining the powers and responsibilities of each level of government.  There was no formal agreement among the states before the Constitution came into effect.


**5. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Local self-government primarily functions as a mechanism for administrative delegation of powers from higher levels of government.
2.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments have enhanced the democratic decentralization aspect of local self-government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While local self-government involves some delegation of administrative functions from higher tiers, its primary focus is not merely administrative delegation.  Local self-government aims to empower local communities to participate in decision-making and development processes relevant to their specific needs and contexts. It's an exercise in democracy, with local bodies elected by the people.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd (Panchayats) and 74th (Municipalities) Constitutional Amendments were landmark legislation that significantly enhanced the democratic decentralization aspect of local self-government in India. They enshrined local bodies in the Constitution, providing them with constitutional status and powers, and mandating periodic elections, thus promoting greater participation and accountability.


**6. With reference to the Parliament of India's control over the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The adjournment motion is a primary tool for the Parliament to directly remove the Council of Ministers.
2.  Question Hour and supplementary questions provide mechanisms for the Parliament to scrutinize the activities of the Council of Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The adjournment motion is used to discuss urgent matters of public importance, but it is not a direct mechanism for removing the Council of Ministers.  The primary method for removing the Council of Ministers is through a no-confidence motion passed by the Lok Sabha.  An adjournment motion may indirectly lead to a no-confidence motion, but it does not directly remove the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is correct. Question Hour and supplementary questions are integral parts of parliamentary procedure.  They provide opportunities for members of Parliament to question ministers about government policies, actions, and performance. This scrutiny keeps the executive accountable to the legislature and the public.  The ability to ask detailed supplementary questions allows for a thorough examination of government affairs.


**7. With reference to private member's bills in the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A private member's bill can only be introduced by a nominated Member of Parliament.
2.  Private member's bills have been passed by the Parliament on several occasions in its history.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Private member's bills can be introduced by any Member of Parliament (MP), whether elected or nominated.  The distinction lies in whether the bill is introduced by a government minister (government bill) or by a non-ministerial MP (private member's bill).  The right to introduce bills is a fundamental aspect of parliamentary democracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While private members' bills are introduced, they rarely get passed into law due to limited parliamentary time and the government's legislative agenda taking precedence.  Although there have been instances of private member's bills being passed, it is extremely rare.


**8. With reference to the advantages of the parliamentary form of government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The executive and legislature operate independently, ensuring a clear separation of powers.
2.  The executive branch remains accountable to the legislature, fostering responsiveness and preventing tyranny.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key feature of the parliamentary system is the fusion of the executive and legislature.  The executive branch (Council of Ministers) is drawn from and accountable to the legislature (Parliament).  This close relationship ensures that the government's actions are subject to parliamentary oversight and debate.  A clear separation of powers, as seen in the presidential system, is not a characteristic of the parliamentary system.

Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental strength of the parliamentary system is the accountability of the executive to the legislature.  The Council of Ministers needs to maintain the confidence of the legislature to remain in power.  This accountability mechanism helps to ensure that the government acts in the best interests of the people and prevents the accumulation of unchecked power.


**9. With reference to the principle underlying the Cabinet form of Government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cabinet form of government primarily serves to minimize criticism of the government.
2.  The Cabinet form of government is a mechanism to ensure collective responsibility of the government to the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cabinet system may indirectly lead to a degree of collective responsibility and thus reduce some criticism, its primary function is not to minimize criticism.  The Cabinet system is fundamentally a mechanism of governance, not a tool for public relations.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core principle of the Cabinet form of government is collective responsibility.  This means that the entire Cabinet is collectively accountable to the legislature for its actions.  If the Cabinet loses the confidence of the legislature, it must resign.  This collective responsibility prevents individual ministers from acting independently and potentially undermining the government's policies.


**10. With reference to Judicial Review in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Judicial Review empowers the judiciary to question the wisdom of laws enacted by the legislature.
2.  Judicial Review allows the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Judicial review in India primarily focuses on the constitutionality of laws, not on their wisdom or efficacy.  The courts do not substitute their judgment for that of the legislature on policy matters.  The courts' role is to ensure that legislation does not violate the fundamental rights or other constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Judicial review is a cornerstone of India's constitutional framework.  It empowers the judiciary to determine whether laws passed by the legislature or executive orders issued by the government are consistent with the Constitution.  If a law or order is found to be unconstitutional, the court can declare it void.  This power ensures that the government remains within its constitutional limits.


**11. With reference to the superior virtue of democracy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Democracy primarily promotes the development of exceptional individuals with strong leadership qualities.
2.  Democracy enhances the active participation and engagement of ordinary citizens in decision-making processes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While democracy can create opportunities for exceptional individuals to emerge as leaders, its superior virtue does not lie solely in fostering exceptional leadership.  Democracy's strength lies in the broader participation of ordinary citizens.  A focus on exceptional individuals risks undermining the core principles of inclusivity and representation that are central to democracy.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core strength of democracy is its ability to harness the intelligence, wisdom, and experiences of a broad range of citizens.  Democratic systems provide avenues for participation—voting, public discourse, and engagement in civic organizations—that empower citizens to contribute to decision-making processes. This engagement is vital for both the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic governance.


**12. With reference to equality in society, consider the following statements:**

1.  Equality in society implies the absence of competition among individuals.
2.  Equality in society necessitates the elimination of privileges enjoyed by certain groups.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Equality in society does not mean the absence of competition.  Competition is a natural aspect of human interaction, and a healthy level of competition can be beneficial for societal progress.  Equality, however, aims to ensure that all individuals have a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the competition, regardless of their background or social status.  The focus is on equal opportunity, not eliminating competition itself.

Statement 2 is correct.  Equality in society requires the elimination of privileges that disproportionately benefit certain groups at the expense of others.  These privileges can be based on factors such as caste, class, gender, or religion.  Eliminating these privileges is crucial for creating a truly equitable society where all individuals have equal opportunities and rights.  The idea is to establish a level playing field.


**13. With reference to the residuary powers under the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  Residuary powers were vested in the Federal Legislature under the 1935 Act.
2.  The 1935 Act established a clear division of powers between the Federal and Provincial Legislatures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under the Government of India Act 1935, residuary powers (powers not explicitly assigned to either the federal or provincial legislatures) were vested in the Governor-General. This is a significant departure from the later Indian Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Government of India Act 1935 established a detailed system for the division of powers between the federal and provincial legislatures.  It categorized subjects into three lists—Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent—clearly outlining the legislative competence of each level of government.  This division was a crucial aspect of the Act's structure.


**14. With reference to Aadhaar card, consider the following statements:**

1.  An Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2.  Once issued, an Aadhaar number cannot be deactivated or modified by the issuing authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a unique identification number, not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  While it can be used as proof of identity, it does not definitively establish citizenship or residency.  Other documents are required to prove citizenship and domicile.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar numbers are intended to be unique and permanent, they are not immutable.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has mechanisms for updating information and, in certain circumstances, deactivating or modifying Aadhaar numbers.  This is necessary to correct errors or address security concerns.


**15. With reference to the Right to Privacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Right to Privacy is explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Constitution of India.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has recognized the Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the original text of the Constitution.  However, the Supreme Court of India has interpreted various provisions of the Constitution to imply a right to privacy.

Statement 2 is correct. In the landmark *Puttaswamy* case, the Supreme Court of India affirmed that the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.  The Court's reasoning involved interpreting Article 21 broadly to encompass the right to life with dignity, which includes the right to privacy.


**16. With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The value of each Member of Legislative Assembly's (MLA) vote is uniform across all states.
2.  The value of votes of Lok Sabha MPs is higher than the value of votes of Rajya Sabha MPs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The value of an MLA's vote is not uniform across all states. It varies from state to state, based on a formula that considers the state's population.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The value of votes for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs is determined by a formula in the Constitution and the value of votes for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs is not necessarily different.  The formula does not inherently make one higher than the other.


**17. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a Governor during their term of office.
2.  The emoluments and allowances of a Governor cannot be diminished during their term of office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution provides immunity from criminal proceedings against a Governor during their term of office.  This protection is intended to safeguard the Governor's independence and prevent undue influence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution explicitly states that the emoluments, allowances, and privileges of a Governor cannot be reduced during their term of office.  This provision is designed to ensure the financial security and independence of the Governor.


**18. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes the exercise of powers to make regulations, rules, etc., by the executive.
2. The Committee on Government Assurances monitors the implementation of assurances given by ministers in Parliament.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation is a parliamentary committee that reviews the rules, regulations, and by-laws issued by the executive branch to ensure they are within the scope of the powers delegated by the Parliament or the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Committee on Government Assurances is responsible for tracking and monitoring the implementation of assurances or promises made by ministers during parliamentary debates. This ensures that the government keeps its commitments to the Parliament.


**19. With reference to the Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker vacates their office upon the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.
2.  If the Speaker ceases to be a member of the Assembly, they automatically vacate their office.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker's position is directly linked to the functioning of the Assembly. When the Assembly is dissolved, the Speaker's term also comes to an end.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker must be a member of the Assembly to hold the office. If they lose their membership (e.g., through disqualification), they automatically vacate the Speaker's position.  This maintains the integrity of the Assembly's leadership.


**20. With reference to Article 356 of the Constitution (President's Rule), consider the following statements:**

1. The imposition of President's Rule automatically suspends Article 19 (Fundamental Rights related to freedom of speech, etc.).
2.  The imposition of President's Rule leads to the Parliament exercising the powers of the State Legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 19 is not automatically suspended during President's rule. While the government may take actions that restrict these rights in a state of emergency, these restrictions must be justified and comply with the Constitution. Article 19 is not automatically suspended.

Statement 2 is correct. Under Article 356, when President's Rule is imposed, the Parliament can exercise the legislative powers of the State Legislature.  This is a significant aspect of the Union government's power to intervene in state affairs.


**21. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can add laws to the Ninth Schedule.
2. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule are immune from judicial review.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliament has the power to add laws to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  This was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny, but it has been used for a wider range of legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws in the Ninth Schedule were initially intended to be immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has ruled that even laws placed in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate fundamental rights or other provisions of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has limited the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protection.



**22. With reference to the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swatantra Party was the single largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha.
2. The recognition of the Leader of the Opposition was established in 1969.
3. A party needs at least 75 members to have its leader recognized as the Leader of the Opposition.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the first Lok Sabha, the Swatantra Party was the single largest opposition party.

Statement 2 is correct. The formal recognition of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was established in 1969. Before that, there was no formal mechanism for recognizing the Leader of the Opposition.

Statement 3 is correct.  There is a numerical threshold for the recognition of the Leader of the Opposition. Currently, a party needs at least 10% of the total strength of the Lok Sabha (approximately 55 members) to have its leader recognized as the Leader of the Opposition. The number is not fixed and may change over time.


**23. With reference to the relationship between law and liberty, consider the following statements:**

1.  More laws necessarily imply less liberty.
2.  The absence of laws implies the absence of liberty.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between law and liberty is not a simple inverse correlation.  Well-crafted laws can actually protect and enhance liberty by establishing a framework of rights and responsibilities and preventing arbitrary actions by the government or other individuals.  Excessive or poorly designed laws can restrict liberty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The absence of laws does not equate to liberty.  Without laws and a system for enforcing them, there is potential for chaos and the violation of individual rights.  Liberty requires a framework of rules and regulations to protect individual rights and ensure societal order.  Liberty flourishes under the rule of law, not in its absence.


**24. With reference to the Rule of Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rule of Law necessitates the limitation of governmental powers.
2. The Rule of Law implies that people are responsible to the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A fundamental principle of the Rule of Law is that governmental power is limited and subject to legal constraints.  This prevents arbitrary exercise of power and protects individual rights.  The government itself must act within the bounds of the law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rule of Law emphasizes the government's accountability to the law, not the people's responsibility to the government.  While citizens have responsibilities to uphold the law, the Rule of Law primarily focuses on the government's obligation to adhere to the legal framework and respect individual rights.  The emphasis is on governmental accountability.


**25. With reference to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTE Act mandates that teacher eligibility in a state be determined solely by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE).
2. The RTE Act requires a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) for teaching primary classes, conducted according to NCTE guidelines.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCTE sets national standards for teacher education, the RTE Act allows states to set their own minimum qualifications for teachers, in addition to the NCTE guidelines.  States have flexibility in determining teacher eligibility, though they must meet the basic standards set by the NCTE.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTE Act mandates a TET for teachers of primary classes.  This test is designed to assess the competency of prospective teachers and ensure a minimum standard of teaching quality.  The guidelines for the TET are developed in consultation with the NCTE.


**26. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament, while the CPCB was created by an executive order.
2.  The NGT's primary function is to promote cleanliness and improve air and water quality, unlike the CPCB.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NGT was established through an Act of Parliament, giving it statutory backing and legal authority.  The CPCB, on the other hand, was established by an executive order of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NGT's primary function is to provide environmental justice and reduce the burden of environmental litigation on higher courts.  The CPCB is responsible for monitoring and regulating pollution levels, promoting cleanliness, and improving air and water quality.  Their roles are distinct but complementary.


**27. With reference to Money Bills, consider the following statement:**

1. A bill containing only provisions related to imposing, abolishing, remitting, altering, or regulating any tax is automatically considered a Money Bill.
2. Only the Lok Sabha can initiate a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of a Money Bill in the Constitution includes provisions related to the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax. If a bill falls under this definition, it is deemed a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct.  Only the Lok Sabha can introduce a Money Bill.  This is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system, reflecting the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government finances.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations, but cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.


**28. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha's powers:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a motion for the removal of the President of India.
2. The Rajya Sabha has the power to amend or reject a Money Bill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Only the Lok Sabha can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of India. The Rajya Sabha plays a role in the impeachment process after the Lok Sabha initiates it, but it cannot initiate the process itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.  It can only offer suggestions or recommendations to the Lok Sabha within a stipulated time frame.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on a Money Bill.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.


**29. With reference to the Rajya Sabha's powers relative to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in the passage of financial bills that include matters beyond those specified in Article 110.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can discuss but not vote on the demands for grants.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Lok Sabha has exclusive power over Money Bills (Article 110), financial bills that extend beyond Article 110 are treated differently.  Both Houses have equal powers in the passage of such financial bills.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget and express its views, but it cannot vote on the demands for grants.  This is a key difference between the two houses, reflecting the Lok Sabha's primary control over financial matters.


**30. With reference to the Rajya Sabha's special powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can authorize Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State List.
2. The Rajya Sabha alone can initiate the removal of the Vice-President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 249 of the Constitution grants the Rajya Sabha the power to resolve a situation where the Parliament needs to legislate on a subject in the State List (a subject normally under the purview of state governments) in the national interest.  This power reflects the Rajya Sabha's role in maintaining federal balance.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 67 of the Constitution states that a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President can only be initiated in the Rajya Sabha.  This is a unique power vested solely in the Rajya Sabha.


**31. With reference to parliamentary privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. Parliamentary privileges extend to the President of India.
2.  The 44th Amendment Act restored the freedom of the press to publish true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Parliamentary privileges do not extend to the President. While the President is an integral part of Parliament, they are not subject to its privileges. The President's position is unique, and their actions are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the same way as those of MPs.

Statement 2 is correct. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 significantly altered the landscape of parliamentary reporting, restoring the freedom of the press to publish truthful reports of parliamentary proceedings without needing prior permission from the House.  This amendment aimed to protect freedom of speech and the public's right to information.  However, this does not apply to secret sittings.


**32. With reference to the collective privileges of each House of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Each House has the power to punish members for breach of privilege or contempt.
2.  The courts can inquire into the proceedings of a House or its committees.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Each House of Parliament possesses the inherent power to maintain order and protect its dignity.  This includes the power to punish members (or outsiders) for breaches of privilege or contempt of the House.  This power is essential for the effective functioning of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The courts generally do not interfere with the internal proceedings of Parliament or its committees.  This principle of non-interference is essential to protect the independence of the legislature.  The courts recognize the Parliament's inherent authority to regulate its own

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body comprising a single Chief Election Commissioner and a variable number of Election Commissioners, appointed by the President of India.
2. The Election Commission of India is solely responsible for the delimitation of constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India's composition is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and may include other Election Commissioners, as determined by the President.  The number of Election Commissioners is not fixed and can vary depending on the needs of the election process.  This flexible structure allows for efficient management of elections at different scales.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections, the delimitation of constituencies is not solely its responsibility.  Delimitation is a complex process often involving parliamentary action and independent delimitation commissions, not directly under the Election Commission's purview. The Election Commission focuses on the conduct of elections within the already defined constituencies.


**2. With reference to the President's rule in a State, consider the following statements:**

1. Proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The President can directly legislate for the State under President's rule, bypassing the State Legislature entirely.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the proclamation of President's rule often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in session, especially if there's a possibility of restoring a democratically elected government quickly.  The decision to dissolve the assembly is a matter of political judgment and executive decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President doesn't directly legislate under President's rule. The power to make laws for the state during President's rule rests with the Parliament. However, this is done through the normal legislative process, with bills introduced, debated, and passed in both houses of Parliament before receiving presidential assent.  The Parliament does not have unlimited legislative power; it's still bound by the Constitution.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature at the Centre and a unicameral legislature in all states.
2. The Indian federal structure is characterized by asymmetric federalism, granting varying degrees of autonomy to different states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indian Parliament is bicameral (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), not all states have unicameral legislatures. Some states have bicameral legislatures (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), reflecting historical and political considerations. The choice of unicameral or bicameral structures isn't uniform across all states.

Statement 2 is correct. Indian federalism displays asymmetric features.  Different states enjoy varying degrees of autonomy based on factors such as their historical context, geographical location, and unique socio-political circumstances. For example, special provisions exist for some states in the Constitution, reflecting this asymmetric nature.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament of India can amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights, through a simple majority.
2. The concept of judicial review, allowing the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Parliament cannot amend any part of the Constitution through a simple majority.  The amendment process involves special majorities and, in some cases, ratification by state legislatures, depending on the nature of the amendment.  Amendments to Fundamental Rights, for instance, require a special majority.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court of India has the power of judicial review, the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the term "judicial review."  However, the power is implicitly derived from the Constitution's basic structure and the Supreme Court's role as the interpreter of the Constitution. The power of judicial review has been established through judicial precedents and interpretations.


**5. With reference to local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Gram Sabhas in all villages.
2. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act extends the provisions of local self-government to all urban areas, irrespective of their population size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) mandates the establishment of Gram Sabhas, which are village-level assemblies, giving them a crucial role in local governance.  This is a cornerstone of democratic decentralization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) deals with urban local governance, but it does not extend the provisions to all urban areas regardless of size.  The act applies to municipalities and other urban local bodies, but there are certain population thresholds and other criteria for the establishment of different types of urban local bodies.  The Act doesn't cover all settlements indiscriminately.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.
2. The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha can exercise the powers of the Speaker during the Speaker's absence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In the event of a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides. This is stipulated in the Constitution to ensure a single authority to manage proceedings during such a rare event.

Statement 2 is correct. The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha can indeed exercise the powers and functions of the Speaker when the Speaker is absent from the House or unable to perform their duties.  This ensures the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha even during the Speaker's absence.


**7. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not in the Rajya Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters and the control it exerts over the government's budget.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments to the Lok Sabha, but the Lok Sabha is not bound to accept those recommendations. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to reviewing and suggesting changes, not vetoing.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. The President of India can dismiss a Union Minister without the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The principle of collective responsibility means that the entire Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, is accountable to the Lok Sabha. If the Lok Sabha loses confidence in the government, the Council of Ministers must resign.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President of India appoints Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister.  Dismissal of a Minister usually follows the Prime Minister's recommendation, reflecting the parliamentary system's conventions and the Prime Minister's authority over the Council of Ministers.  The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, not independently.


**9. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President.
2. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the pleasure of the President. This signifies the President's ultimate authority over the states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor possesses the power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President. This is a crucial check and balance mechanism, allowing the President to review significant legislation before it becomes law.  This power is particularly relevant for bills that might affect the federal balance or national interests.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not those of State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG of India, an important constitutional authority, is appointed by the President of India. This ensures the CAG's independence and impartiality in performing its auditing function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union Government and the State Governments.  This comprehensive audit scope ensures transparency and accountability in the use of public funds at both the central and state levels.  The CAG's reports are crucial for parliamentary oversight.


**11. With reference to the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NJAC was established by a constitutional amendment to ensure transparency and efficiency in the appointment of judges.
2. The NJAC's composition included members from the judiciary, the executive, and civil society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NJAC was indeed established via a constitutional amendment aimed at reforming the process of appointing judges to higher courts, intending to make it more transparent and less susceptible to influence.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The NJAC's composition included representatives from various sectors: the Chief Justice of India, two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, the Union Minister of Law and Justice, and two eminent persons.  This diverse representation was intended to bring various perspectives to judicial appointments.  (Note: The NJAC was later struck down by the Supreme Court).


**12. Consider the following statements:**

1. The right to privacy is explicitly guaranteed as a fundamental right in the Constitution of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India has upheld the right to privacy as a fundamental right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution. However, this right has been interpreted and recognized by the Supreme Court as an intrinsic part of other fundamental rights, particularly Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty).

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India has, in several landmark judgments, recognized and upheld the right to privacy as a fundamental right, integral to the protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.  This has significantly shaped the understanding of fundamental rights in India.


**13. With reference to the powers of the Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including the basic structure, through a simple majority.
2. The Parliament can make laws on any subject within the Union List, irrespective of the views of the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament cannot amend the basic structure of the Constitution through a simple majority.  This principle, developed through judicial interpretation, protects the core features of the Constitution from alteration.  Amendments to the Constitution require special majorities and, in certain cases, ratification by state legislatures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament has exclusive legislative power on subjects listed in the Union List.  State Governments have no say in legislation on these matters, reflecting the central government's authority over areas of national importance like defense, foreign affairs, and currency.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can exercise his/her pardoning power only in cases involving offences against the Union laws.
2. The President of India can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's pardoning power extends to all offences, whether against Union laws or State laws.  This power is part of the executive's clemency function and applies to a range of offences.

Statement 2 is correct. The President of India has the power to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or any other lesser punishment.  This is a significant aspect of the President's pardoning power, allowing for mitigation of punishment based on various factors.


**15. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Directive Principles are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by courts.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state by guiding the state's policies towards social and economic justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not directly enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  While they don't create legally enforceable rights, they significantly influence government policies and actions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles are designed to guide the state in creating a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice, equality, and the overall well-being of citizens. They provide a framework for policymaking, influencing legislation and government programs.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination for recruitment to all India Services.
2. The UPSC's composition and functions are entirely determined by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is indeed the primary body responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination, the gateway to various positions in the All India Services and other central government services.  This is a core function of the UPSC and central to the recruitment process for the civil services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Parliament can amend laws related to the UPSC's functioning, its composition and some fundamental aspects are defined in the Constitution itself.  The Constitution guarantees the independence and authority of the UPSC, ensuring that it is not entirely under the control of the Parliament.  The Constitution provides a framework for the UPSC's structure and role.


**17. With reference to the powers of the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States.
2. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over all cases involving fundamental rights violations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India possesses original jurisdiction in certain matters, notably disputes between the Government of India and one or more States or between States inter se. This original jurisdiction is a key part of the Supreme Court's role in resolving federal disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court has significant power in matters related to fundamental rights, its appellate jurisdiction is not all-encompassing.  There are specific routes for appeals to reach the Supreme Court, and not every case involving fundamental rights violations automatically goes to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is defined by specific provisions and procedures.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission:**

1. The Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission is indeed constituted by the President of India, typically every five years or as needed, to examine the financial relations between the Union and the States. The Commission's role is crucial in maintaining fiscal balance and equity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments. They are, however, highly influential and generally accepted due to the Commission's expertise and the importance of its recommendations for fiscal management.  The government can choose to not follow recommendations but this is rare.


**19. With reference to the powers and functions of the Prime Minister, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is the head of the Union Council of Ministers.
2. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of India, who can dismiss the Prime Minister at will.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Prime Minister is the head of the Union Council of Ministers and plays a crucial role in leading the government.  This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system, where the Prime Minister is responsible for coordinating and directing ministerial activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Prime Minister, the President cannot dismiss the Prime Minister at will.  The Prime Minister must command the confidence of the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament).  If the Prime Minister loses this confidence, they are expected to resign, or the President may dismiss them.  The President's power is constrained by the conventions of the parliamentary system.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent House and is not subject to dissolution.
2.  The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate Money Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, is a permanent body and is not subject to dissolution.  Its members serve for six-year terms, with one-third of the members retiring every two years.  This ensures continuity in the Upper House.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate Money Bills. This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha, reflecting its primary role in financial matters.  The Rajya Sabha can only discuss and suggest amendments to Money Bills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  The Principles aim to establish a welfare state by outlining socio-economic goals for the nation.
2.  These Principles are not justiciable, meaning courts cannot enforce them directly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are guidelines for the state to strive towards achieving social and economic justice.  Statement 1 is correct because the DPSPs broadly aim to create a welfare state by setting socio-economic goals like providing adequate means of livelihood, equal pay for equal work, and free and compulsory education.  These principles are intended to guide the government's actions in creating a more equitable and just society.  However, they are not legally enforceable by courts. Statement 2 accurately reflects this aspect.  The courts cannot compel the state to implement the DPSPs; they are considered non-justiciable.  The difference between Fundamental Rights and DPSPs is crucial here.  While Fundamental Rights are enforceable, DPSPs are aspirational goals that the state should strive to achieve within its resources and capabilities.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs is a deliberate constitutional choice to allow flexibility in their implementation based on changing socio-economic circumstances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for the dual nature of DPSPs: their aspirational goal-setting and their non-justiciable character.


**2. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to amend Money Bills, but not to reject them.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay, not reject, a Money Bill, and its recommendations are not binding on the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, is the upper house of the Indian Parliament. Its powers regarding Money Bills are limited compared to ordinary bills.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments, and the Lok Sabha (the lower house) is not obligated to accept these recommendations.  The Lok Sabha's decision on a Money Bill is final.  Statement 2 correctly describes the Rajya Sabha's limited power over Money Bills.  It can only return a Money Bill to the Lok Sabha with its recommendations, but the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject these suggestions. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill outright, nor can it delay it indefinitely. The time limit for consideration of a Money Bill by the Rajya Sabha is 14 days.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the Rajya Sabha's limited but significant role in the legislative process concerning Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily one of review and recommendation, not of veto power.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act clearly defined the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature at the central level.
2.  The Act introduced dyarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level, dividing powers between Indian ministers and executive councilors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, aimed at introducing limited self-governance in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act did not clearly define the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature at the central level. The executive remained largely under the control of the British government, and there was no clear delineation of powers between the judiciary and the legislative branches. Statement 2 is correct.  A significant feature of the 1919 Act was the introduction of dyarchy at the provincial level.  This system divided subjects into two categories: transferred subjects (administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislature) and reserved subjects (administered by the executive councilors under the Governor's control).  This was a step towards greater Indian participation in governance, although control over crucial areas remained with the British.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the key features of the 1919 Act.  The Act's focus was primarily on provincial governance and the introduction of dyarchy, not on a comprehensive separation of powers at the central level.


**4. With reference to the procedure for passing a bill in the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  If a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, it must be passed by a simple majority of the total membership of both houses.
2.  A joint sitting is convened only when there's a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on a non-Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Parliament's legislative process involves both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  Statement 1 is incorrect. If a bill is referred to a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament (following a deadlock), it requires a simple majority of members present and voting, not a simple majority of the total membership of both Houses. The total membership is irrelevant; only the members present and voting at the joint sitting determine the outcome.  Statement 2 is correct. A joint sitting, as per Article 108 of the Constitution, is convened only when there is a disagreement between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on a non-Money Bill. The President can summon a joint sitting to resolve the deadlock. Money Bills are exclusively within the Lok Sabha's domain, and a joint sitting is not applicable to them.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misinterpret the voting requirement for bills passed in a joint sitting or misrepresent the circumstances under which a joint sitting is called. The correct understanding of the legislative process, particularly concerning joint sittings, is crucial for comprehending the functioning of the Indian Parliament.


**5. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1.  NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission and functions as an advisory body to the Union Government on matters of economic and social development.
2.  NITI Aayog's primary function is to formulate five-year plans for India's economic development, similar to the Planning Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), established in 2015, succeeded the Planning Commission.  Statement 1 is correct.  NITI Aayog is a policy think tank that advises the Union Government on various aspects of economic and social development.  It works in a collaborative manner with states and other stakeholders to formulate development strategies.  However, unlike the Planning Commission, NITI Aayog does not have the authority to formulate mandatory five-year plans.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Although NITI Aayog engages in strategic planning, it is more of a facilitator and advisor than a central planning authority that dictates national development strategies.  The shift from a centralized planning model to a more cooperative and consultative approach is a defining characteristic of NITI Aayog.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent NITI Aayog's role as a policy advisor or incorrectly attribute the function of formulating five-year plans to it. The understanding of NITI Aayog's role as a collaborative policy think tank is important in comprehending contemporary Indian governance.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Executive Power of the Union of India:**

1.  The Executive Power of the Union is vested in the President, who exercises it through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
2.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the Public Service Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India vests executive power in the President.  Statement 1 accurately describes this. Although the President is the nominal head of the executive, the real executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible to the Parliament.  The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not the ex-officio Chairman of the Public Service Commission (PSC).  The PSC, at the Union level (UPSC) and state levels, is an independent constitutional body responsible for recruitment to civil services.  Its chairman and members are appointed by the President, but the Prime Minister does not hold this position ex-officio.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly attribute the chairmanship of the PSC to the Prime Minister or fail to recognize the President's role as the nominal head of the executive, with actual power exercised through the Council of Ministers.  Understanding the relationship between the President, the Council of Ministers, and the PSC is essential for a thorough grasp of the Indian executive system.


**7. With reference to the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in certain states.
2.  The Sixth Schedule outlines the administration of tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, establishing autonomous district councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution address the governance of tribal areas.  Statement 1 is correct. The Fifth Schedule provides for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in certain states.  It empowers the Governor to make regulations for these areas, focusing on the protection and development of tribal communities.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Sixth Schedule details the administration of tribal areas in the four northeastern states mentioned: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils, granting them significant powers in local governance and resource management. These councils have legislative, executive, and judicial functions within their designated areas.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the distinct yet complementary roles of both the Fifth and Sixth Schedules in addressing the governance and welfare of tribal populations in different parts of India.  Understanding these schedules is vital for analyzing India's constitutional provisions for the protection of tribal rights and their self-governance.


**8. With reference to the Union Government's financial procedures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget, which is presented to Parliament.
2.  No funds can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Budget is a crucial aspect of the Indian financial system. Statement 1 is largely correct. While the entire process involves multiple departments, the Department of Revenue plays a central role in preparing the Union Budget. It is responsible for estimating revenue and expenditure, and the budget proposals are largely shaped by this department. However, it is not solely responsible; other departments and ministries also contribute to the budget-making process. Statement 2 is correct.  Article 112 of the Constitution mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India (the primary source of government funds) without the authorization of Parliament.  This ensures parliamentary control over government spending.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the roles of the Department of Revenue and Parliament in the Union government's financial procedures.  While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in budget preparation, Parliament holds the ultimate authority over government spending.


**9. Who among the following is/are the custodian(s) of the Constitution of India?**

1. The Supreme Court of India.
2. The President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land. Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, acts as its custodian.  It has the power of judicial review, ensuring that laws and government actions conform to the Constitution. Its judgments shape the understanding and application of constitutional principles. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President of India is the head of state and is bound by the Constitution, the President is not the custodian. The President's role is largely ceremonial and executive, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President does not interpret the Constitution or ensure its enforcement. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly attribute custodianship to the President or fail to recognize the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of constitutional matters. The Supreme Court's role in upholding the Constitution is a cornerstone of India's democratic system.


**10. With reference to the Legislative Council of a State in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Legislative Council can be larger in size than half of the Legislative Assembly of that State.
2.  The Governor of the State nominates one-third of the members to the Legislative Council.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Legislative Council, or Vidhan Parishad, is the upper house of the bicameral state legislatures in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Legislative Council cannot be larger than half the size of the Legislative Assembly. Article 171(3) of the Constitution stipulates that the maximum strength of a Legislative Council cannot exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned and that it should not be less than 40. Statement 2 is correct. The Governor nominates one-third of the members of the Legislative Council.  These nominated members are chosen from amongst persons having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement, and social service.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the size restrictions on the Legislative Council or fail to acknowledge the Governor's role in nominating a portion of its members. The composition and powers of the Legislative Council are important aspects of the Indian federal structure.


**11.  With reference to the provision "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India," consider the following statements:**

1. This provision is part of the Fundamental Duties enshrined in Part IVA of the Constitution.
2. This provision is included in the Preamble to the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The phrase "To uphold and protect the Sovereignty, Unity, and Integrity of India" is a fundamental aspect of the Indian nation's identity. Statement 1 is correct. This is explicitly mentioned as one of the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens, as added by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976. Fundamental Duties are moral obligations of citizens towards the nation. Statement 2 is also correct. The Preamble to the Constitution of India, which outlines the nation's founding principles and objectives, implicitly contains this idea.  The Preamble's commitment to "secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation" clearly reflects the aim of upholding sovereignty, unity, and integrity.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the dual presence of this principle in both the Fundamental Duties and the spirit of the Preamble.  Understanding the importance of this provision in both parts of the Constitution is crucial for comprehending the nation's foundational principles.


**12. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary goal is to achieve political accountability at the grassroots level through periodic elections.
2.  A key objective is to ensure fiscal decentralization by empowering Panchayats with significant financial resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Panchayati Raj system aims to empower local self-governance in rural areas. Statement 1 is correct.  Political accountability is a core objective.  The system of periodic elections at the village, intermediate, and district levels ensures that the elected representatives are answerable to the people.  This is designed to increase participation and responsiveness in local governance. Statement 2 is also correct. Fiscal decentralization is another key goal. Panchayats are constitutionally empowered to levy taxes and receive grants, enabling them to manage their own finances and implement development schemes independently. This empowers them and reduces dependence on higher levels of government. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the importance of both political accountability and fiscal decentralization as fundamental aspects of the Panchayati Raj system.  Understanding these dual objectives is essential for comprehending the system's effectiveness and challenges.


**13. With reference to the concept of a "Welfare State" in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept is primarily enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy.
2. The concept is explicitly mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The concept of a welfare state is a central theme in the Indian Constitution. Statement 1 is correct.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) articulate the vision of a welfare state.  Many DPSPs, such as those related to providing social security, promoting education, and ensuring adequate means of livelihood, directly contribute to the creation of a welfare state.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Preamble doesn't explicitly use the term "welfare state."  While the Preamble aims to secure social and economic justice, it does not explicitly define India as a welfare state.  The commitment to social justice and equality is implied, but not explicitly stated as the establishment of a welfare state. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misinterpret the Preamble's role or fail to recognize the central role of the DPSPs in outlining the framework for a welfare state. The DPSPs are aspirational goals that guide the state's actions in creating a society where the well-being of all citizens is prioritized.


**14. With reference to the Parliamentary System of Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The system is characterized by the Council of Ministers being collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2.  The system is primarily defined by the Rajya Sabha's power to amend the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India follows a parliamentary system of government, a key feature of which is the relationship between the executive and the legislature. Statement 1 is correct.  The parliamentary system in India is fundamentally defined by the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). This means that the government must retain the confidence of the Lok Sabha; otherwise, it must resign.  The Lok Sabha can remove the government through a no-confidence motion. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha's role in constitutional amendments is not the defining characteristic of the parliamentary system. While the Rajya Sabha participates in the amendment process, the Lok Sabha's role is equally important.  The power to amend the Constitution rests with the Parliament as a whole, not solely with the Rajya Sabha.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the defining feature of the parliamentary system or fail to distinguish between the roles of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in constitutional amendments.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the lapsing of Bills in the Indian Parliament:**

1.  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses upon the Lok Sabha's prorogation.
2.  A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha, but not yet passed by the Lok Sabha, does not lapse upon the Lok Sabha's dissolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The lifespan of bills in the Indian Parliament is governed by specific rules. Statement 1 is correct. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses if the Lok Sabha is prorogued (its session is adjourned indefinitely).  This means the bill must be reintroduced in a new session if it is to be considered further.  Statement 2 is also correct.  A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha that has not been passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse upon the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  This is because the Rajya Sabha's consideration of the bill is independent of the Lok Sabha's dissolution.  The bill remains alive and can be considered further when the new Lok Sabha is constituted. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the specific rules governing the lapsing of bills in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, particularly in relation to prorogation and dissolution. The understanding of these rules is essential for comprehending the legislative process in India.


**16. With reference to the appointment and tenure of the Chief Secretary in an Indian State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chief Secretary is appointed by the Governor of the State.
2.  The Chief Secretary has a fixed tenure of office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chief Secretary is the highest-ranking civil servant in an Indian state. Statement 1 is correct.  The Chief Secretary is appointed by the Governor of the State, typically on the advice of the Chief Minister.  The Governor, as the nominal head of the state executive, makes the formal appointment. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chief Secretary does not have a fixed tenure.  While there might be some norms or expectations regarding the duration of the appointment, there's no legally mandated fixed term.  The Chief Secretary serves at the pleasure of the government and can be transferred or replaced at any time. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the appointment process or incorrectly claim a fixed tenure for the Chief Secretary.  The understanding of the appointment and tenure of the Chief Secretary is crucial for grasping the dynamics of the state bureaucracy.


**17. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas can hear both civil and criminal cases.
2.  The Act allows for the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators in dispute resolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(c) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act aims to provide accessible justice at the village level. Statement 1 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) are empowered to hear both civil and criminal cases, subject to certain jurisdictional limits.  They are intended to provide a simpler and quicker way of resolving disputes at the local level, reducing the burden on higher courts. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including the involvement of local social activists as mediators or conciliators.  This is designed to promote amicable settlements and reduce the adversarial nature of formal court proceedings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual jurisdiction of Gram Nyayalayas in both civil and criminal matters and the Act's provision for the use of local mediators to facilitate dispute resolution.


**18. With reference to the Parliament of India's power to legislate on items in the State List, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List only if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority.
2.  The Parliament can legislate on any item in the State List if a resolution to that effect is passed by the Lok Sabha with a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution's federal structure divides legislative powers between the Union and the States. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Parliament's power to legislate on items in the State List (even in the national interest) is triggered by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  The resolution needs a simple majority of the total membership of the Lok Sabha, not a two-thirds majority. Statement 2 is correct.  Article 249 of the Constitution allows the Parliament to legislate on a subject in the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest.  However, the initiating resolution must come from the Lok Sabha, and it only needs a simple majority. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional provision regarding the Parliament's power to legislate on State List items.  The Lok Sabha's role is paramount in this process.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the minimum age for Panchayat membership in India:**

1. The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years.
2.  The Constitution specifies the minimum age for Panchayat membership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 provided for Panchayati Raj institutions. Statement 1 is correct. The minimum age for membership in a Panchayat is 21 years, as per the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.  This is consistent with the age requirement for voting in general elections. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Amendment Act established the Panchayati Raj system, the Constitution itself does not explicitly specify the minimum age for Panchayat membership. The specific age limit is determined by legislation enacted under the provisions of the 73rd Amendment. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the minimum age or fail to distinguish between the constitutional provision for Panchayati Raj and the subsequent legislation defining the age requirement.


**20. With reference to the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals, consider the following statements:**

1. The proposals were primarily concerned with reforming the Indian police administration.
2. The proposals aimed at introducing major constitutional reforms in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Montague-Chelmsford Report of 1918 laid the groundwork for significant changes in Indian governance.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Montague-Chelmsford Proposals were not primarily focused on police administration reform.  While administrative reforms were part of the overall plan, the core objective was constitutional reform. Statement 2 is correct. The proposals recommended major constitutional changes, including the introduction of dyarchy (dual governance) at the provincial level, giving some power to Indian ministers, and expanding the legislative councils. These reforms, though limited, represented a step towards greater Indian participation in governance. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the primary focus of the Montague-Chelmsford Proposals on constitutional reform, not merely on specific administrative changes.  The proposals were a significant milestone in the evolution of Indian self-governance.


**21. With reference to the Preamble of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble explicitly mentions the concept of economic liberty as a fundamental objective.
2. The Preamble guarantees liberty of thought, expression, and belief.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Preamble to the Indian Constitution outlines the nation's founding principles. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Preamble aims to secure social and economic justice, it does not explicitly mention "economic liberty" as a distinct fundamental objective. The focus is on securing social and economic justice, which might include aspects of economic freedom, but it is not explicitly stated. Statement 2 is correct. The Preamble explicitly guarantees "Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship." These are fundamental freedoms that the Constitution aims to protect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misinterpret the Preamble's focus on economic aspects or fail to recognize the explicit mention of several important liberties.  The Preamble is a concise yet powerful statement of the nation's founding principles and aspirations.


**22. With reference to the Right against Exploitation in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. It includes the prohibition of child labor in factories and mines.
2.  It encompasses the abolition of untouchability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 23 and 24 of the Indian Constitution deal with the Right against Exploitation. Statement 1 is correct.  The Right against Exploitation explicitly prohibits the employment of children in hazardous industries such as factories and mines. This is a crucial provision aimed at protecting children from exploitation and ensuring their well-being. Statement 2 is incorrect. The abolition of untouchability is covered under Article 17 of the Constitution, which is a separate provision dealing with the elimination of social discrimination based on caste.  While both provisions aim to protect vulnerable groups, they address different forms of exploitation and discrimination. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include the abolition of untouchability under the Right against Exploitation or fail to recognize that the prohibition of child labor is a specific part of this right.


**23. With reference to the Fundamental Duties of an Indian citizen, consider the following statements:**

1. There is a specific legislative process to enforce these duties.
2.  These duties are correlative to Fundamental Rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. Statement 1 is incorrect.  There is no specific legislative process to enforce Fundamental Duties.  Unlike Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable, Fundamental Duties are primarily moral obligations.  While the state can promote these duties through various measures, there is no direct mechanism for enforcing them through courts. Statement 2 is correct.  Fundamental Duties and Fundamental Rights are closely related.  The enjoyment of Fundamental Rights necessitates the fulfillment of Fundamental Duties. They are considered correlative; the responsible exercise of rights depends on the fulfillment of duties. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly claim a legislative process for enforcing Fundamental Duties or fail to recognize their correlative relationship with Fundamental Rights.  The understanding of this relationship is important for comprehending the balance between individual rights and societal responsibilities.


**24. With reference to the relationship between Rights and Duties in the Indian context, consider the following statements:**

1. Rights are considered independent of duties and are primarily personal claims.
2.  Rights and duties are correlative; the responsible exercise of rights depends on the fulfillment of duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The relationship between rights and duties is a fundamental aspect of a just society. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rights and duties are not entirely independent.  While individuals possess inherent rights, the responsible exercise of these rights necessitates the fulfillment of corresponding duties.  Rights and duties are intertwined in a democratic society. Statement 2 is correct.  Rights and duties are considered correlative.  A citizen's enjoyment of rights is conditional upon the responsible exercise of these rights and the fulfillment of their duties towards society and the state.  This reciprocal relationship is crucial for maintaining social order and individual liberty. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the interdependence of rights and duties or fail to recognize the correlative nature of this relationship in a democratic framework.


**25. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Amendment added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women.
2. The Directive Principles constitute limitations upon both the legislative and executive functions of the government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) guide the state in achieving social and economic justice. Statement 1 is correct.  The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution added the principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women to the DPSPs. This is a significant provision aimed at promoting gender equality in the workplace. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles do not constitute direct limitations upon the legislative and executive functions of the government.  They are not legally enforceable by courts; they serve as guidelines that the state should strive to achieve.  The government's actions are not directly invalidated if they contradict a DPSP. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly attribute limitations on government functions to the DPSPs or fail to recognize the addition of equal pay principle through the 42nd Amendment.


**26. With reference to the election to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. Only a citizen of India whose name appears in the electoral roll of a constituency

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment to the Constitution mandates indirect elections for chairpersons of Panchayats at the intermediate and district levels.
2.  The 73rd Amendment Act requires fresh elections within six months if a Panchayat is dissolved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does *not* mandate indirect elections for chairpersons of Panchayats at the intermediate and district levels.  While some states may choose indirect elections, the Act itself leaves the method of election to the state legislatures.  The focus is on establishing Panchayati Raj institutions and ensuring their democratic functioning, but the specific electoral mechanisms are left flexible.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act explicitly states that fresh elections must be held within six months of the dissolution of a Panchayat. This ensures the continuity of democratic processes at the local level and prevents prolonged periods without elected representatives.  This provision is crucial for maintaining the vitality of Panchayati Raj institutions.


**2. With reference to the provisions of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act empowers the State Governor to decide the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of Panchayati Raj institutions.
2.  One-third of the seats in Panchayats are reserved for women, irrespective of the number of seats reserved for SC and ST women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act does *not* empower the State Governor to decide the procedure for the maintenance of accounts and audit of Panchayati Raj institutions.  The Act establishes a framework for the financial administration of Panchayats, but the details of accounting and auditing procedures are usually determined by state legislation, often in consultation with state finance commissions. The Governor's role is primarily ceremonial and executive, not directly involved in setting such technical procedures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act reserves *at least* one-third of the seats in Panchayats for women.  However,  it also specifies that this reservation is *in addition to* any seats reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) women.  Therefore, the total number of reserved seats for women can be greater than one-third, depending on the state's specific composition and reservation policies.


**3. With reference to the office of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor possesses executive, legislative, and judicial powers analogous to the President.
2.  The Governor always acts with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor's powers are analogous to the President's in some respects (e.g., appointing the Chief Minister, assenting to bills), the extent of their powers differs significantly. The Governor does not possess independent judicial powers; the judiciary is entirely separate.  The analogy primarily lies in their roles as constitutional heads of their respective spheres.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Governor does *not* always act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Constitution grants the Governor certain discretionary powers, particularly in situations involving the breakdown of constitutional machinery or when no single party or coalition commands a clear majority in the Legislative Assembly.  In such cases, the Governor may exercise his/her judgment independently.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor of a state:**

1.  The Governor’s salary and allowances are drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The Governor has the power to allocate the business of the government among various ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor's salary and allowances are drawn from the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India. This reflects the financial autonomy of the states within the federal structure.  The Central government does not directly fund the Governor's emoluments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor has the power to allocate the business of the government among various ministers. However, this power is usually exercised by the Chief Minister, who then advises the Governor on the allocation of portfolios. The Governor's role is primarily a formal one in this process, ratifying the Chief Minister's recommendations.


**5. With reference to the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The federating units (states) have been given equal representation in the Rajya Sabha.
2.  Indian federalism is the result of an agreement among the federating units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The states do *not* have equal representation in the Rajya Sabha. Representation in the Rajya Sabha is based on the population of each state, but this does not translate to equal representation for all states. Larger states naturally have more representatives than smaller ones. This is a key difference from a perfectly symmetrical federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Indian federalism is *not* the result of an agreement among the federating units.  It is a product of the Constitution of India, which was framed by the Constituent Assembly representing the entire nation.  While the concerns of various regions and groups were considered, the federal structure was not a negotiated agreement between pre-existing independent entities.  Instead, it was a consciously designed system by the makers of the Constitution.


**6. Consider the following statements about the CAG:**

1.  The CAG compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments.
2.  The CAG has control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG does *not* compile and maintain the accounts of state governments.  While the CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State governments, the responsibility for compiling and maintaining these accounts rests with the respective state governments themselves.  The CAG's role is to audit these accounts for accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG does *not* have control over the issue of money from the Consolidated Fund of India.  The authority to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund rests with the Parliament, acting through Appropriation Bills.  The CAG's role is to audit the expenditure made from this fund, ensuring that funds are spent according to the sanctioned allocations and in a lawful manner.


**7. With reference to the difference between a censure motion and a no-confidence motion, consider the following statements:**

1.  A censure motion requires a statement of reasons, while a no-confidence motion does not.
2.  A no-confidence motion can only be moved against the Council of Ministers, not against individual ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While censure motions often include a detailed statement of reasons for their adoption, this is not a strict constitutional requirement.  The primary difference lies in the consequences: a censure motion expresses disapproval, but a no-confidence motion can lead to the fall of the government.  There's no mandatory requirement for a specific format or inclusion of reasons for either motion.

Statement 2 is correct. A no-confidence motion is specifically directed against the entire Council of Ministers, aiming to test the government's overall support in the legislature.  It cannot be moved against individual ministers.  Censure motions, on the other hand, can be directed against individual ministers or groups of ministers to express disapproval of their actions or policies.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Balwantray Mehta Committee:**

1.  The committee recommended that the District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zila Parishad.
2.  The committee advocated for constitutional protection for Panchayati Raj institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Balwantray Mehta Committee, in its report, recommended that the District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zila Parishad. This reflected the committee's emphasis on integrating the existing administrative structure with the new Panchayati Raj system, although this recommendation was not universally adopted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Balwantray Mehta Committee did *not* advocate for constitutional protection for Panchayati Raj institutions.  Constitutional status for Panchayats was later achieved through the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.  The Mehta Committee's recommendations were primarily administrative and organizational, aiming to improve the effectiveness of rural governance.


**9. With reference to the functions of the Estimates Committee, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Estimates Committee suggests alternative policies to improve administrative efficiency and economy.
2.  The Estimates Committee examines whether money is well laid out within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Estimates Committee, a parliamentary committee, plays a significant role in scrutinizing government expenditure. One of its key functions is to suggest alternative policies and measures to enhance administrative efficiency and economy.  It examines the estimates of expenditure and identifies areas where savings can be achieved or resources utilized more effectively.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core function of the Estimates Committee is to examine whether the government's expenditure aligns with the stated policies and objectives.  It assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the utilization of public funds, ensuring value for money.  The committee's scrutiny helps to improve accountability and transparency in government spending.


**10. Consider the following statements about municipal corporations:**

1.  Municipal corporations in states are established by acts of the concerned state legislatures.
2.  Municipal corporations work under the direct control and supervision of the state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Municipal corporations in states are established through legislation enacted by the respective state legislatures.  This reflects the states' primary responsibility for urban governance within their territories. The legislative process ensures that the structure and powers of municipal corporations are defined through a democratic and transparent procedure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While state governments exercise significant influence over municipal corporations, they do not operate under *direct* control and supervision. Municipal corporations possess a degree of autonomy in their functioning, albeit within the framework of state laws and policies. State governments provide guidance and oversight, but the day-to-day administration and decision-making largely reside within the municipal bodies themselves.


**11. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UPSC can serve the needs of a state only when requested by the President of India.
2.  The UPSC's functions can be extended by an act of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC can serve the needs of a state not only at the request of the President but also at the request of the Governor of that state. The President acts as the executive head for the union, and the Governor acts as the head for the state.  The Constitution allows for the UPSC to perform functions for states, giving flexibility to meet the needs of both the Union and State governments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliament has the power to expand the functions of the UPSC through legislation. This provision is essential for adapting the UPSC's responsibilities to evolving administrative needs and changes in governance structures.  The Parliament's ability to modify the UPSC's mandate ensures the commission remains relevant and effective.


**12. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A minister at the central level can be dismissed by the Prime Minister.
2.  The Finance Commission facilitates the maintenance of financial balance between the Union and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A minister at the central level holds office at the pleasure of the Prime Minister.  While formally appointed by the President, the Prime Minister's advice is binding, and the Prime Minister can effectively dismiss a minister by advising the President to do so.  This reflects the principle of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Commission's primary role is to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.  This process aims to ensure a balance in the financial capabilities of different levels of government, contributing to the stability and fairness of the federal system.  The Commission's recommendations play a key role in managing intergovernmental fiscal relations.


**13. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NGT has been established by an Act of Parliament.
2.  The NGT's primary function is to promote cleanliness of streams and wells and improve air quality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established through an Act of Parliament, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  This Act provided the legal framework for the Tribunal's establishment, jurisdiction, and powers.  The NGT's creation reflects the growing awareness of the need for specialized environmental justice mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NGT's primary function is *not* to promote cleanliness of streams and wells or improve air quality directly. While these are environmental concerns that the NGT's decisions might indirectly influence, the NGT's core mandate is to provide environmental justice and reduce the burden of litigation in higher courts regarding environmental issues. It adjudicates cases related to environmental damage, pollution, and other related matters.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is primarily responsible for monitoring and regulating pollution levels.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha has no power to vote on the demands for grants.
2.  A money bill cannot be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) does not have the power to vote on the demands for grants (budgetary allocations).  This power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  This reflects the Lok Sabha's role as the primary body representing the people and responsible for controlling government expenditure.

Statement 2 is correct. A money bill, which deals with matters of taxation and public finance, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can only consider a money bill for a maximum of 14 days, and it cannot amend it.  This restriction ensures that the Lok Sabha retains primary control over the government's financial affairs.


**15. With reference to the President's rule in a state, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proclamation of President's rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2.  President's rule leads to the removal of the Council of Ministers in the State.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The proclamation of President's rule (Article 356) does *not* automatically dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.  While the Assembly is often dissolved concurrently with the imposition of President's rule, it is not a mandatory consequence.  The President can choose to keep the Assembly functioning or dissolve it depending on the circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. The imposition of President's rule necessarily leads to the removal of the Council of Ministers in the state.  The state government's authority is suspended, and the state's administration is taken over by the central government.  The Council of Ministers, being responsible to the state legislature, loses its legitimacy under President's rule.


**16. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission of India is a single-member body.
2.  The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India is currently a single-member body.  Although it was originally a three-member body, it is now headed by a single Chief Election Commissioner.  The single-member structure has been subject to debate, with some advocating for a return to a multi-member commission to enhance independence and impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs does *not* decide the election schedule.  The Election Commission of India itself is responsible for determining the election schedule, ensuring free and fair elections.  The Commission's independence in this matter is crucial for maintaining its neutrality and credibility.


**17.  Consider the following statements regarding the right to vote and to be elected in India:**

1. It is a Fundamental Right.
2. It is a Constitutional Right.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The right to vote and to be elected in India is *not* explicitly a Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution.  While it is a cornerstone of democracy and essential for the functioning of a democratic system, it's not categorized as a Fundamental Right in the same way as rights to equality, freedom, and against exploitation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The right to vote and to be elected is a Constitutional Right, guaranteed under the provisions related to elections and the structure of the legislature.  The Constitution outlines the framework for elections and the qualifications for being elected to various legislative bodies.  These provisions constitute a constitutional guarantee of the right to participate in the democratic process.


**18. With reference to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament of India can place any law in the Ninth Schedule.
2. The validity of a law placed in the Ninth Schedule cannot be challenged in any court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parliament of India has the power to add any law to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  This power was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial review, but its scope has expanded over time.  However, the use of the Ninth Schedule has been subject to considerable debate and criticism regarding its impact on judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While laws in the Ninth Schedule were initially intended to be immune from judicial review, the Supreme Court has clarified that this immunity is not absolute.  The Court has held that even laws included in the Ninth Schedule are subject to judicial review if they violate fundamental rights or the basic structure of the Constitution.  Therefore, a law in the Ninth Schedule is not entirely beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny.


**19. Consider the following statements about the "Rule of Law":**

1.  The "Rule of Law" implies limitation of powers.
2.  The "Rule of Law" requires people's responsibility to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of the "Rule of Law" is the limitation of powers, both of the government and of individuals.  No one is above the law, and all are subject to its constraints. This principle prevents arbitrary exercise of power and protects fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Rule of Law" emphasizes the government's responsibility to the people, not the other way around.  While citizens have responsibilities, the essence of the "Rule of Law" is that the government is accountable to the law and to the people, and that its actions are subject to legal constraints and scrutiny. The focus is on the government's adherence to the law, not primarily on citizen's responsibility to the government.


**20. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee on Public Accounts scrutinizes and reports whether the powers conferred by the Constitution or delegated by the Parliament are being properly exercised by the Executive.
2. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines whether the promises made by ministers on the floor of the House have been fulfilled.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Committee on Public Accounts primarily examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and assesses the government's accountability for the use of public funds.  It does not directly scrutinize the exercise of powers by the Executive in the manner described.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation is responsible for that aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Committee on Government Assurances, not the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, is responsible for examining whether the promises made by ministers on the floor of the House have been fulfilled.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation focuses on scrutinizing the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the Executive.  It examines whether regulations, rules, and by-laws issued by the executive branch are within the scope of the powers granted to them by Parliament or the Constitution.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Council of Ministers:**

1.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2.  Individual ministers are responsible to the President, who can dismiss them at will.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility holds that the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha.  If the Lok Sabha loses confidence in the government (through a no-confidence motion), the entire Council must resign.  This ensures the executive branch remains answerable to the elected representatives of the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President (Article 75), this is largely a formality. The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister.  Individual ministers are primarily accountable to the Prime Minister and, collectively, to the Parliament. The President's power to dismiss a minister independently is rarely exercised and would be considered highly unusual in a functioning parliamentary democracy. The dismissal of a minister would typically follow a loss of confidence in the government as a whole.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can withhold assent to a Money Bill.
2.  The President can return a non-Money Bill for reconsideration by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President does not have the power to withhold assent to a Money Bill.  Article 111 of the Constitution mandates that the President must give assent to a Money Bill passed by Parliament.  This reflects the Parliament's supreme authority over financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President possesses a suspensive veto over non-Money Bills. This means the President can return a non-Money Bill passed by Parliament for reconsideration.  However, if Parliament passes the Bill again, the President is bound to give their assent. This provides a mechanism for review and deliberation, but ultimately, Parliament's will prevails.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the state.
2. The Governor can dismiss a state minister without the advice of the Chief Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, who commands the confidence of the majority in the State Legislative Assembly. This is a constitutional requirement, ensuring that the head of the state government is chosen through a democratic process within the state legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor possesses certain discretionary powers, dismissing a state minister without the advice of the Chief Minister is not one of them.  The Governor is bound by the convention of acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister.  Dismissing a minister unilaterally would be a breach of this convention and would be highly unusual in a functioning democratic system.  The Chief Minister has the authority to recommend a minister's dismissal, and the Governor typically acts on this recommendation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Development Council (NDC):**

1.  The NDC is a constitutional body.
2.  The NDC is chaired by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDC is not a constitutional body. It is a non-statutory body established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet.  It plays a crucial role in coordinating economic and social planning between the Union and State governments, but its existence is not mandated by the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister chairs the NDC.  This reflects the central government's leading role in coordinating national development priorities and strategies, while also ensuring input from the states.  The Prime Minister's chairmanship emphasizes the importance of the NDC in national planning.


**5. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) has limited powers regarding Money Bills.  It cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only make recommendations.  Furthermore, it cannot reject a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has the final say on Money Bills, reflecting the principle that the lower house controls the nation's purse strings.  The Rajya Sabha's role is primarily to review and suggest amendments, but its power is subordinate to that of the Lok Sabha in financial matters.  This arrangement ensures that financial legislation is not unduly delayed or obstructed.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General can vote in Parliament.
2. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Attorney General of India cannot vote in Parliament.  They are not a member of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  Their role is to advise the government on legal matters and represent the government in court, not to participate directly in the legislative process through voting.

Statement 2 is correct. The Attorney General can participate in the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament, albeit without the right to vote. They can attend meetings, speak on matters of law, and offer legal expertise.  This ensures that Parliament has access to high-level legal advice during the legislative process.  Their participation contributes to informed decision-making within Parliament.


**7. With reference to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), consider the following statements:**

1. NALSA provides free legal services only to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
2. NALSA is a constitutional body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NALSA provides free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society, not limited to only Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Its mandate is to ensure equal access to justice for all marginalized and vulnerable groups.  The scope of NALSA's services is broader than just specific castes or tribes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NALSA is a statutory body, established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, not a constitutional body.  While its functions are crucial for upholding the right to justice, its establishment and operation are governed by legislation, not the Constitution itself.  This distinction clarifies its legal basis and operational framework.


**8. Consider the following statements about the powers of the Parliament:**

1. Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List in the national interest.
2. Parliament needs the consent of all states before it can legislate on a subject in the State List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parliament possesses the power to legislate on any subject mentioned in the State List (matters normally under the purview of state governments) if it deems it necessary in the national interest.  This power is enshrined in the Constitution and is intended to address matters of national importance that transcend state boundaries.  However, this power is not absolute and needs to be exercised judiciously.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Parliament does not require the consent of all states before legislating on a State List subject. The power to legislate on State List subjects in the national interest is a crucial aspect of the Indian federal system, but it does not require unanimous consent from all states.  A resolution in the Rajya Sabha is the necessary condition for the Parliament to exercise this power.


**9. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President every five years.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Finance Commission every five years, or as and when required, to review the financial relations between the Union and the states. This is a constitutional mandate, ensuring regular assessment and equitable distribution of financial resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the Central Government. The government can accept or reject the recommendations, but it usually considers them seriously before taking a decision.  The government's response to the recommendations is usually presented in Parliament, ensuring transparency and accountability.  This balance of power allows the government flexibility while still emphasizing the importance of the commission's expertise.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Governor's powers:**

1. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration.
2. The Governor's power to reserve a bill is absolute and cannot be questioned.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration. This is a significant power that allows for a second check on state legislation.  The President has the power to give assent, withhold assent, or return the bill for reconsideration.  This process ensures that state laws align with the national interest and constitutional principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor's power to reserve a bill is not absolute.  While the Governor has discretion in certain cases, the power is not unlimited, and its exercise can be subjected to judicial review.  The courts may intervene if there is evidence of malafide or arbitrary use of this power.  The convention is that the Governor usually acts on the aid and advice of the council of ministers, though there are exceptions.


**11. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles are justiciable.
2. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the state to strive towards social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  This distinction is crucial to understanding their role in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directive Principles aim to establish a welfare state, where the government actively works to improve the social and economic well-being of its citizens.  They provide a framework for social and economic policy, guiding the state towards a more just and equitable society.  The principles emphasize social security, education, healthcare, and other essential aspects of a welfare state.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India.
2. The President appoints the other judges of the Supreme Court based on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India.  This is a constitutional provision reflecting the President's role as the head of state.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints other judges of the Supreme Court, but in accordance with the advice and recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.  This process ensures that the appointments are made based on merit and judicial expertise, maintaining the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The collegium system plays a crucial role here.


**13. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can amend the Union Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in controlling government expenditure and financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) cannot amend the Union Budget (which is essentially a Money Bill).  It can only discuss the Budget and suggest amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final authority to approve or reject the Budget.  The Rajya Sabha’s power is limited to recommending changes, but the Lok Sabha's approval is crucial for the Budget to become law.  This division of power ensures that financial legislation is not unduly delayed or obstructed while maintaining the power of the Lok Sabha in financial matters.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the CAG.  This appointment ensures the CAG’s independence from the executive branch and underscores the importance of financial accountability in governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Central and State Governments.  This is a crucial function for ensuring transparency and accountability in public finances at both levels of government.  The CAG's audit reports are presented to Parliament and State Legislatures respectively, promoting public scrutiny and good governance.


**15. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act provides for special courts to try offenses under the Act.
2. The Act empowers the appropriate government to provide for the rehabilitation of victims of atrocities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, provides for the establishment of special courts to expedite the trial of offenses committed against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This ensures timely justice for victims of atrocities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act empowers the appropriate government (Central or State) to make provisions for the rehabilitation of victims of atrocities.  This includes measures like providing financial assistance, medical care, and legal aid to facilitate the victims' recovery and reintegration into society.  Rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of the Act, aiming to address not only the legal consequences of atrocities but also the broader social and economic impacts on victims.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Development Council is a statutory body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The Planning Commission was an extra-constitutional body that played a crucial role in India's economic planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Development Council (NDC) is not a statutory body established under the Constitution of India. It was formed in 1952 by a resolution of the government.  The NDC is a forum for discussion and coordination between the Union and State governments on matters related to national development.  The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the NDC, highlighting its extra-constitutional nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Planning Commission was indeed an extra-constitutional body established in 1950.  It played a vital role in formulating and implementing India's five-year plans, guiding the nation's economic development for several decades.  Its existence was based on government resolutions, not constitutional provisions.  The Planning Commission was later replaced by the NITI Aayog.  The absence of constitutional backing for the Planning Commission is a key point to remember for UPSC examinations.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Directive Principles of State Policy are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.
2. The Fundamental Rights are non-justiciable and cannot be enforced by courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are not justiciable.  While they are considered important goals for the state to strive towards, they are not legally enforceable by courts.  This is a crucial distinction between DPSPs and Fundamental Rights.  The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs reflects the Constitution's balancing act between individual rights and social goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fundamental Rights are indeed justiciable.  They are legally enforceable by the courts, providing individuals with legal recourse against state actions that violate these rights.  The Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in upholding and interpreting Fundamental Rights.  The justiciability of Fundamental Rights is a cornerstone of India's constitutional democracy.  The contrast between justiciable Fundamental Rights and non-justiciable DPSPs is a common theme in UPSC questions.


**3. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution of India explicitly mandates that a Money Bill can only originate in the Lok Sabha (Article 110). This reflects the principle of financial control residing primarily with the directly elected lower house. The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to considering the Money Bill, suggesting amendments, and returning it to the Lok Sabha within 14 days.  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject the amendments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only suggest amendments. The Lok Sabha has the final say regarding the acceptance or rejection of those suggested amendments. The Rajya Sabha's limited power in relation to Money Bills underscores the Lok Sabha's dominant position in financial matters. This is a fundamental aspect of the Indian parliamentary system tested frequently in UPSC examinations.


**4. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India (Article 155).  This appointment is a significant aspect of the Indian federal system, reflecting the Union's role in the appointment of key state officials. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, not the Prime Minister (Article 156).  This emphasizes the Governor's constitutional position as a representative of the Union at the state level, independent of the state's political executive.  While the Prime Minister's advice influences the appointment, the President's pleasure determines the tenure.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of India's federal structure.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission is a multi-member body with a fixed tenure for its members.
2. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although initially a multi-member body, the Election Commission of India currently consists of a single Chief Election Commissioner and a variable number of Election Commissioners, appointed by the President.  While the CEC has a fixed six-year term or until 65 years of age, whichever is earlier, the Election Commissioners' terms are not as clearly defined in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, the President of India, and the Vice-President of India.  This independent body plays a critical role in upholding democratic principles and ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.  This is a key function of the ECI, frequently discussed in the context of UPSC examinations.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble to the Constitution outlines the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Fundamental Rights are absolute and cannot be restricted under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Although not explicitly defining the "basic structure," the Preamble sets forth the foundational ideals and objectives of the Indian Constitution:  Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic, Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. These ideals underpin the structure and functioning of the government and inform the interpretation of constitutional provisions.  The Supreme Court has used the Preamble in interpreting the Constitution's basic structure doctrine.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Fundamental Rights, while crucial, are not absolute.  The Constitution itself allows for reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interest of public order, morality, security, etc.  The balance between individual freedoms and societal needs is a recurring theme in constitutional law, and the limitations on Fundamental Rights are a critical aspect of this balance.


**7. With reference to the Union Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the President of India.
2. The Union Budget includes both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Finance Minister on behalf of the President. While the President is the head of state and all financial bills require their recommendation, the actual presentation is undertaken by the Finance Minister.

Statement 2 is correct. The Union Budget is a comprehensive document that includes both the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget. The Revenue Budget deals with the government's receipts and expenditure during a fiscal year, while the Capital Budget deals with the government's capital receipts and expenditure.  The composition of the Union Budget is a key feature often tested in the UPSC examination.


**8. With reference to the Indian Judicial System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of appeal in India.
2. The High Courts in India have original jurisdiction only, and no appellate jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court of the country and the final court of appeal.  Its decisions are binding on all other courts in India.  The Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of law is a cornerstone of India's judicial system and is frequently examined in UPSC questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. High Courts in India possess both original and appellate jurisdiction.  Original jurisdiction refers to the power to hear cases directly, while appellate jurisdiction refers to the power to hear appeals from lower courts.  The dual jurisdiction of High Courts is a fundamental aspect of India's judicial hierarchy.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Panchayati Raj Institutions in India:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for the establishment of three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate, and district levels in all states.
2. The Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels, but it does not impose a rigid three-tier structure on all states. Some states may have a two-tier or even a single-tier system depending on their population and administrative needs. The flexibility in the structure of PRIs is an important feature of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gram Sabha, as defined by the 73rd Amendment, comprises all persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village within the Panchayat's area. This body plays a crucial role in local governance and decision-making at the village level. The composition of the Gram Sabha is a key aspect of the PRIs' functioning.


**10. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs are enforceable by courts of law in the same manner as Fundamental Rights.
2. DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India by guiding the state's policies towards social and economic justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  DPSPs are *not* justiciable; they cannot be enforced by courts like Fundamental Rights.  This is a key difference between the two. While they are important goals for the state to work towards, they do not create legally enforceable claims.

Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs are designed to guide the state in creating a welfare state, promoting social and economic justice, and improving the quality of life for all citizens. They provide a framework for state action in areas like education, healthcare, and economic development.  The welfare state ideal is a central theme behind the DPSPs.


**11. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.
2. The President of India can nominate 2 members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India has the power to nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, who possess special knowledge or practical experience in art, literature, science, and social service. This provision aims to ensure representation of expertise in the upper house.

Statement 2 is also correct. The President can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian community if, in the President's opinion, that community is not adequately represented in the House.  This is a special provision to ensure representation of a specific community.  Both these nomination powers reflect the President's role in balancing representation in the Parliament.


**12.  Consider the following statements regarding the Attorney General of India:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General is a member of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General for India is appointed by the President of India (Article 76).  This appointment is usually made on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Attorney General serves as the government's chief legal advisor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General is not a member of Parliament.  While they have the right to attend Parliament and participate in its proceedings, they do not have voting rights.  The Attorney General's role is primarily advisory and legal, not legislative.  The difference between attending Parliament and being a member is important for UPSC.


**13. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution establishes a unitary system of government with a strong central government.
2. The distribution of powers between the Union and the States is based on the principle of federalism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution establishes a federal system of government, not a unitary one. While the center has significant powers, the states also have considerable autonomy in their respective spheres.  India's federalism is a complex mix of features, often described as a "quasi-federal" system due to the strong centralizing tendencies.

Statement 2 is correct. The distribution of legislative and executive powers between the Union and the States is a core feature of Indian federalism. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the three lists—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List—that define these powers.  Understanding the structure of this power-sharing is fundamental to comprehending India's federal system.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Finance Commission of India:**

1. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India every five years.
2. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India (Article 280) every five years or at such earlier time as the President considers necessary.  The Commission's primary role is to recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are extremely influential, they are *not* legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  The government can accept or reject the recommendations, but it is politically difficult to ignore them completely due to their authority and expertise.  The non-binding nature of recommendations is a key aspect often tested by UPSC.


**15. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fundamental Duties are justiciable and can be enforced by courts.
2.  The Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fundamental Duties, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts. They are moral obligations on citizens to contribute to the nation's progress.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.  This amendment also added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble. The inclusion of Fundamental Duties aimed to instill a sense of civic responsibility among citizens. The addition of Fundamental Duties and their non-justiciable nature is a significant constitutional development.


**16. With reference to the Indian President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The President can unilaterally dismiss a State Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha (Article 85) but only on the advice of the Prime Minister. This reflects the principle of parliamentary supremacy in the Indian political system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President cannot unilaterally dismiss a State Governor. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.  While the President can dismiss a Governor, it typically happens on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers and usually follows a serious breakdown in the relationship between the Governor and the State Government.  The procedure for removing a Governor is more complex than a simple unilateral dismissal.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha represents the States of India.
2. The Rajya Sabha can be dissolved by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, represents the States of India. Its members are indirectly elected by the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies.  This reflects the federal structure of India, giving states a voice in the national legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body; it cannot be dissolved.  Only the Lok Sabha, being the house of the people, can be dissolved by the President.  The permanence of the Rajya Sabha ensures continuity in the legislative process.  The difference in the nature of the two houses is a key aspect of the Indian Parliament.


**18. With reference to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The PAC is a parliamentary committee that examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
2. The PAC consists of members from both Houses of Parliament, with a majority from the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PAC is a parliamentary committee that examines the CAG's audit reports. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, and the PAC scrutinizes these reports to ensure financial accountability.  The PAC's role in financial oversight is crucial for maintaining transparency and efficiency in government spending.

Statement 2 is also correct. The PAC is composed of members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, but the majority of members are from the Lok Sabha.  This composition reflects the Lok Sabha's greater representation of the people.  The composition and function of the PAC are often relevant in UPSC examinations.


**19.  Consider the following statements regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of only the Union Government and not the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President of India (Article 148). This ensures the CAG's independence from the executive branch. The CAG is an important pillar of financial accountability within the Indian system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and the State Governments.  This broad mandate ensures that financial accountability applies across all levels of government. The CAG's role in auditing both Union and State accounts is a crucial aspect of India's financial governance system.


**20. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion to all citizens.
2. The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion under Article 25, allowing individuals to practice, profess, and propagate any religion, or not to practice any religion at all. This freedom is a fundamental right, reflecting India's commitment to secularism.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 15 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, among other things, in access to public places, employment, and other matters.  This anti-discrimination clause is vital for ensuring equality and preventing religious persecution.  Both statements highlight the constitutional commitment to religious freedom and equality.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can directly administer Union Territories through administrators appointed by him.
2. The President of India can declare any area as a Scheduled Area and possesses powers regarding the administration of Scheduled Areas and tribal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the executive powers vested in the President of India as per the Constitution.  Statement 1 correctly points out the President's direct administrative control over Union Territories.  The President appoints administrators to govern these territories, highlighting the executive authority concentrated in the Presidential office.  Statement 2 is equally accurate, emphasizing the President's power to declare Scheduled Areas and exercise specific administrative control over these regions and their tribal populations. This power is crucial for the protection and governance of tribal communities and their unique needs, demonstrating a significant aspect of the President's executive role.  Therefore, option (c) – Both 1 and 2 – is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual executive powers described in both statements, which are both constitutionally enshrined.


**2. With reference to the President's legislative powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, and social service.
2. The President can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the President's legislative powers concerning nominations to Parliament.  Statement 1 correctly states the President's power to nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, representing expertise in specific fields. This nomination power ensures representation of specialized knowledge in the upper house, enriching the legislative process.  Statement 2 is also accurate, outlining the President's power to nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian community to the Lok Sabha. This provision aims to safeguard the representation of this community in the lower house, even if their numerical strength might not warrant direct election. Consequently, both statements are constitutionally supported and accurate, making option (c) the correct choice.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the constitutionally granted nomination powers described in both statements.


**3. With reference to the President's financial powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Money bills can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's prior recommendation.
2. The President causes the annual financial statement (Union Budget) to be laid before Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect the President's crucial role in India's financial system. Statement 1 accurately describes the President's prior recommendation as a prerequisite for introducing money bills in Parliament. This ensures that the President has a say in the legislative process concerning financial matters, acting as a crucial check and balance. Statement 2 is equally accurate, emphasizing the President's role in presenting the Union Budget to Parliament. This act signifies the formal commencement of the budgetary process, highlighting the President's executive function in financial administration. Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements are constitutionally accurate descriptions of the President's financial powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they overlook the significance of the President's role in both initiating money bills and presenting the annual budget, both of which are vital aspects of the President's financial powers.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts.
2. The President can seek advice from the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact; however, this advice is not binding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the President's judicial powers. Statement 1 correctly identifies the President's role in appointing the highest judicial officers in India. This power is crucial for maintaining the independence and integrity of the judiciary, a cornerstone of India's democratic system.  Statement 2 is equally correct, highlighting the President's power to seek advisory opinions from the Supreme Court on complex legal or factual matters. While the Supreme Court's advice is valuable, it remains non-binding, preserving the President's ultimate authority in decision-making.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as both statements correctly describe aspects of the President's judicial powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the combined significance of the President's power in judicial appointments and the seeking of advisory opinions, which are both constitutionally granted.


**5. With reference to the President's diplomatic powers, consider the following statements:**

1. International treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the President but require parliamentary approval.
2. The President represents India in international forums and affairs and exchanges diplomats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect the President's role in India's foreign policy. Statement 1 accurately portrays the President as the head of state, responsible for negotiating and concluding international treaties and agreements. However, it rightly emphasizes the necessity of parliamentary approval for these agreements, ensuring legislative oversight and democratic accountability in foreign policy decisions. Statement 2 is equally accurate in highlighting the President's role as the head of state in representing India internationally. This includes sending and receiving diplomats, signifying the formal conduct of international relations.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as both statements correctly describe crucial aspects of the President's diplomatic powers.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual nature of the President's role in both treaty-making and diplomatic representation, both of which are constitutionally significant.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces of India.
2. The President can declare war or conclude peace, subject to parliamentary approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the President's military powers. Statement 1 correctly states that the President holds the supreme command of India's defense forces. This position symbolizes the President's ultimate authority over the nation's military, though the day-to-day operations are managed by the defense minister and the chiefs of staff. Statement 2 is equally accurate, highlighting the President's power to declare war or conclude peace, but with the crucial caveat of parliamentary approval. This provision ensures that the use of military force is subject to democratic control and oversight.  Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements accurately describe the President's military powers, encompassing supreme command and the power to declare war or peace, subject to parliamentary approval. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not recognize the combined significance of both statements in illustrating the President's executive authority in military matters.



**7. With reference to the President's emergency powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can proclaim a National Emergency under Article 352.
2. The President can impose President's Rule (Article 356 & 365) and a Financial Emergency (Article 360).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the President's extraordinary powers during emergencies. Statement 1 correctly identifies Article 352 as the constitutional basis for the President to proclaim a National Emergency.  This power is a crucial tool for dealing with situations threatening the security of the nation, though it is subject to parliamentary oversight. Statement 2 accurately mentions the President's authority to impose President's Rule (Articles 356 and 365) in states facing constitutional breakdown and Financial Emergency (Article 360) in cases of severe financial instability. These powers allow the President to intervene decisively in exceptional circumstances, although they are subject to limitations and judicial review.  Thus, option (c) is correct because both statements accurately reflect the President's powers to deal with different types of emergencies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the President's authority concerning both National Emergency and other emergency provisions.


**8. With reference to the President's veto power, consider the following statements:**

1. The President possesses the power of absolute veto, whereby he can withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament.
2. The President has suspensive veto power, which can be overridden by Parliament with an ordinary majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the President's veto powers. Statement 1 correctly describes the President's absolute veto power, enabling him to refuse assent to a bill, effectively killing it. This power acts as a check on hasty or ill-considered legislation.  Statement 2 accurately describes the President's suspensive veto, where the President can return a non-money bill to Parliament for reconsideration.  If Parliament passes the bill again, the President must give assent, highlighting the Parliament's ultimate legislative authority.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, as both statements correctly explain different aspects of the President's veto power. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they ignore the existence of either the absolute or suspensive veto power of the President.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Prime Minister's appointment and responsibilities:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President.
2. The Prime Minister is responsible for communicating all decisions of the Council of Ministers to the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Prime Minister's constitutional position and responsibilities. Statement 1 correctly states that the President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition commanding a majority in the Lok Sabha.  This highlights the President's role in forming the government, although the choice is largely determined by political realities.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Prime Minister's responsibility to keep the President informed of all Council of Ministers' decisions and legislative proposals. This ensures that the President, as the nominal head of state, remains aware of government actions, although the President's power to act independently is limited.  Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements accurately reflect the Prime Minister's appointment and key responsibilities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the combined significance of both statements in defining the Prime Minister's constitutional role.


**10. With reference to the Council of Ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2. Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of the Council of Ministers. Statement 1 accurately states the principle of collective responsibility, a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy.  This means the entire Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lok Sabha; a vote of no confidence against the government leads to the resignation of the entire council.  Statement 2 is equally correct, indicating that ministers hold office at the President's pleasure.  While the President formally appoints ministers, this power is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister, reflecting the reality of parliamentary government.  Therefore, option (c) is correct because both statements accurately reflect important features of the Council of Ministers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the significance of both collective responsibility and the President's formal power over ministerial appointments, both of which are constitutionally defined.


**11. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General's appointment requires the qualifications to be a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court.
2. The Attorney General holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the constitutional position of the Attorney General of India. Statement 1 correctly indicates that the Attorney General's appointment necessitates the qualifications to be a Supreme Court or High Court judge.  This ensures the Attorney General possesses the legal expertise needed for this high office. Statement 2 is equally accurate, stating that the Attorney General holds office during the pleasure of the President.  This implies that the President can remove the Attorney General at any time, although this power is usually exercised only in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, option (c) is correct because both statements accurately describe the qualifications and tenure of the Attorney General. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize that both the qualification requirements and the President's power over the Attorney General's tenure are constitutionally defined.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the conduct of government business in India:**

1. All executive actions of the Government of India are expressed to be taken in the name of the President.
2. The President makes rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India and allocates business among ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the constitutional provisions regarding the conduct of government business. Statement 1 is correct, reflecting the principle that all executive actions are formally taken in the President's name, even though the actual decision-making resides with the Council of Ministers.  This formalizes the President's role as the head of state.  Statement 2 is equally correct, highlighting the President's power to make rules for efficient government functioning and allocate responsibilities among ministers.  This power ensures that government business is conducted smoothly and systematically.  Therefore, option (c) is correct because both statements accurately reflect the formal constitutional arrangements for conducting government business in India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the combined significance of both statements in describing the formal constitutional framework for government operations.


**13. With reference to the Prime Minister's duties, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister communicates all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the Union's affairs and proposals for legislation to the President.
2. The Prime Minister furnishes information relating to the administration of the Union's affairs and legislative proposals as the President may require.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the Prime Minister's constitutional duties regarding information flow to the President. Statement 1 correctly outlines the Prime Minister's responsibility to keep the President fully informed about all Council of Ministers' decisions and legislative proposals. This ensures that the President, as the nominal head of state, remains apprised of government activities. Statement 2 is equally correct, emphasizing the Prime Minister's obligation to provide any additional information the President may request concerning the administration or legislation. This ensures transparency and accountability in the relationship between the executive and the head of state. Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements accurately describe the Prime Minister's constitutional duties in informing the President. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the combined significance of both statements in defining the Prime Minister's crucial role in maintaining communication with the President.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the rights of ministers in Parliament:**

1. Every minister has the right to speak and participate in the proceedings of either House of Parliament, joint sittings, and parliamentary committees of which they are members.
2. Ministers are entitled to vote in both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the right of ministers to participate fully in parliamentary proceedings. Ministers have the right to speak and participate in debates and discussions in both houses, joint sittings, and committees where they are members. This ensures their active involvement in the legislative process and their ability to defend government policies and proposals.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While ministers can participate fully in parliamentary debates, they are generally not entitled to vote in both houses.  A minister who is a member of one house can vote only in that house.  Therefore, option (a) is correct because only statement 1 accurately reflects the rights of ministers in Parliament. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the voting rights of ministers, a crucial aspect of parliamentary procedure.


**15. With reference to the oath taken by ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. Ministers swear to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India and uphold its sovereignty and integrity.
2. Ministers swear to communicate or reveal any matter brought under their consideration to any person, except as required for the due discharge of their duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key component of the oath taken by ministers.  Ministers swear to uphold the Constitution, its sovereignty, and the integrity of India. This oath emphasizes their commitment to the nation's fundamental law and the principles of national unity.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Ministers swear to maintain the confidentiality of information related to their official duties, except where disclosure is necessary for the proper execution of their responsibilities.  They do not swear to communicate or reveal information indiscriminately.  Therefore, option (a) is correct because only statement 1 accurately describes the oath taken by ministers.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misinterpret the nature of the oath and the emphasis on confidentiality.



**16. Consider the following statements regarding the collective and individual responsibility of ministers:**

1. The principle of collective responsibility implies that all ministers share joint responsibility for government actions.
2. The principle of individual responsibility means that the President can remove a minister even if the Council of Ministers enjoys the Lok Sabha's confidence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the principles of collective and individual responsibility of ministers. Statement 1 correctly explains the principle of collective responsibility, which means that all ministers are jointly accountable for government decisions and actions.  This ensures unity and coherence in government policy and actions. Statement 2 is also correct; it highlights the principle of individual responsibility, where the President, acting on the Prime Minister's advice, can dismiss a minister even if the government enjoys the Lok Sabha's confidence.  This allows for removing ministers who are deemed unsuitable or ineffective, even if the government as a whole maintains its majority support. Therefore, option (c) is correct, as both statements accurately reflect the principles of collective and individual responsibility. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the dual nature of ministerial accountability, which is both collective and individual.


**17. With reference to the salaries and allowances of ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by Parliament.
2. Ministers receive only the salary and allowances payable to a Member of Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the constitutional provision for determining ministerial salaries and allowances.  Parliament sets the remuneration for ministers, reflecting the democratic principle of legislative control over executive compensation. Statement 2 is incorrect. While ministers receive the salary and allowances of a Member of Parliament, they also receive additional allowances based on their rank and position within the government (such as sumptuary allowances, free accommodation, and other benefits). Therefore, option (a) is correct because only statement 1 accurately describes the determination of ministerial salaries. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the additional benefits and allowances received by ministers beyond the basic MP's salary.


**18. With reference to the  oath of office and secrecy for ministers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President administers the oaths of office and secrecy to ministers.
2.  The oath of secrecy requires ministers to maintain confidentiality regarding matters brought under their consideration, except as needed for their duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of the oath taken by ministers. Statement 1 accurately states that the President administers the oaths of office and secrecy to ministers before they assume their positions. This formal act signifies the commencement of their ministerial duties and their commitment to upholding constitutional obligations. Statement 2 is equally correct, highlighting the importance of maintaining confidentiality in ministerial work.  Ministers swear to keep secret information related to their duties, except where disclosure is necessary for the proper performance of their responsibilities. Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements accurately describe the oath process and its implications for ministerial conduct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either overlook the President's role in administering the oath or misrepresent the nature of the oath of secrecy.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the bureaucracy in India:**

1. The bureaucracy assists ministers in formulating policies and implementing them.
2. The bureaucracy is expected to be politically neutral and not take political positions on policy matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the role and expected behavior of the bureaucracy in India's governance system. Statement 1 correctly points out that the bureaucracy, comprised of civil servants, plays a vital role in assisting ministers in policy formulation and implementation.  Their expertise and administrative capabilities are crucial for effective governance. Statement 2 is equally correct, emphasizing the importance of political neutrality for the bureaucracy.  Bureaucrats are expected to serve any government impartially, implementing policies without bias or taking partisan positions.  This ensures continuity and stability in administration, regardless of changes in government.  Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements accurately reflect the role and characteristics of the Indian bureaucracy.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the dual aspects of the bureaucracy's role in policymaking and its expected political neutrality.


**20. With reference to the All India Services, consider the following statements:**

1. Members of the All India Services constitute the backbone of higher-level bureaucracy in the states.
2.  The Central Government appoints IAS and IPS officers and can take disciplinary action against them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of the All India Services (AIS). Statement 1 is correct; members of the AIS, particularly the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS), form the core of higher administrative positions in state governments. Their presence ensures a degree of uniformity and coordination across different states. Statement 2 is also correct; the central government, not the state governments, appoints IAS and IPS officers and retains the authority to take disciplinary action against them. This arrangement strengthens the central government's control over crucial administrative functions across states.  Therefore, option (c) is correct because both statements accurately reflect the nature and structure of the All India Services.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the combined significance of both statements in defining the AIS's role and the central government's control over it.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can appoint a member of the State Legislative Assembly to preside over its proceedings if both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker's offices are vacant.  
2. The Governor nominates one-sixth of the members of the State Legislative Council from among individuals with special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, the cooperative movement, and social service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Governor possesses the power to appoint a member of the State Legislative Assembly to temporarily chair its proceedings in the event that both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker positions are vacant. This is a crucial function ensuring the legislature's continuous operation during such unforeseen circumstances.  This power is vested in the Governor to maintain the smooth functioning of the state legislature.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor's role in nominating a portion of the State Legislative Council members reflects a commitment to including individuals with expertise in various fields. This ensures the council benefits from diverse perspectives and specialized knowledge contributing to informed decision-making. This nomination power is explicitly granted to the Governor by the Constitution, aiming to enhance the council's expertise and represent broader societal interests.  The inclusion of experts in these fields enriches the legislative process.



**2. With reference to the Governor's powers regarding bills passed by the State Legislature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can withhold assent to any bill, including a money bill, passed by the State Legislature.
2. If the State Legislature passes a bill again after the Governor returns it for reconsideration, the Governor is obligated to give assent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor possesses significant powers regarding bills,  they are not absolute when it comes to money bills.  The Governor cannot withhold assent to a money bill.  This is a crucial safeguard to prevent obstruction of the state's financial processes. The Governor's powers are limited in this area to ensure the smooth functioning of state finances.

Statement 2 is correct.  If a non-money bill is returned by the Governor for reconsideration and is subsequently passed again by the State Legislature, the Governor *must* give assent.  This reflects the principle of legislative supremacy within the constitutional framework.  The Governor's power is suspensive, not absolute, in this context.  The State Legislature's repeated passage of the bill signifies its clear intention, and the Governor is constitutionally bound to respect that.



**3. With reference to the Governor's ordinance-making power, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor's ordinance-making power is a discretionary power, exercisable without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
2. An ordinance promulgated by the Governor remains in effect until it is expressly repealed by the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor's power to promulgate ordinances is not a discretionary power.  It must be exercised with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, reflecting the principle of responsible government.  The Governor acts as a constitutional head, not an independent legislative actor.  The Council of Ministers' advice is essential to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of this significant power.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While an ordinance promulgated by the Governor has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature, it has a limited lifespan.  Ordinances must be approved by the State Legislature within a specified timeframe (usually six weeks) after it reassembles.  Failure to secure approval leads to the ordinance's automatic lapse. This time limit and the requirement of legislative approval prevent the Governor from exercising this power indefinitely.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor's financial powers:**

1. The Governor can introduce money bills in the State Legislature.
2. The Governor must recommend all demands for grants made in the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Governor does not introduce money bills. While the Governor's prior recommendation is required for the introduction of money bills in the State Legislature, the actual introduction is carried out by a member of the Legislature.  This is a standard procedure, reflecting a division of roles within the legislative process. The Governor's role is to ensure that the financial proposals meet constitutional requirements before they are introduced.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor's recommendation is mandatory for all demands for grants in the State Legislature. This ensures that all financial proposals receive the necessary constitutional approval before being considered. It reflects the Governor's role in safeguarding the state's financial integrity and adhering to constitutional processes.  This power prevents the Legislature from making financial demands without the Governor's assent.



**5. With reference to the Governor's judicial powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can pardon a death sentence.
2. The Governor is consulted by the President in appointing judges to the State High Court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, but with a crucial qualification.  While the Governor does possess pardoning powers for most offenses, the power to pardon a death sentence rests with the President, not the Governor. However, the Governor *can* commute or suspend a death sentence, thereby exercising a degree of influence over the ultimate outcome.  This distinction is vital to understanding the limitations of the Governor's judicial powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The President consults the Governor when appointing judges to the State High Court. This consultation is a crucial part of the process and ensures that the appointment reflects the needs and perspectives of the state.  The Governor's input is valuable in this context, as they are deeply involved in the state's affairs. The consultation process ensures a degree of state-level input into the selection of High Court judges.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor's special responsibilities:**

1. The Governor has special responsibilities regarding law and order in Arunachal Pradesh.
2. The Governor has special responsibilities related to the establishment of separate development boards in Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh has special responsibilities concerning law and order, reflecting the unique challenges and circumstances of the state.  These special responsibilities aim to ensure stability and security in the region.  This demonstrates the exceptional circumstances that can lead to the Governor having greater authority in specific areas.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Governor of Gujarat has special responsibilities related to the establishment of separate development boards for certain regions within the state.  These special provisions address regional disparities and promote balanced development.  The existence of such responsibilities highlights the constitutional flexibility to address unique regional needs within a state.  These boards are designed to address specific developmental needs of the regions they represent.


**7. With reference to the Governor's position in the Indian federal system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is the de facto executive authority of the state.
2. The Governor can dismiss the Council of Ministers at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor is the de jure (nominal) executive head of the state, not the de facto (real) executive authority. The Chief Minister, as head of the Council of Ministers, is the de facto executive authority, exercising real power.  The Governor's role is primarily ceremonial, though they do have some reserve powers.  The distinction between de jure and de facto power is critical to understanding the Governor's role.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Governor can dismiss the Council of Ministers, this power is not arbitrary.  They can only do so if the Council of Ministers loses the confidence of the State Legislative Assembly. The Governor's power is constrained by the principle of responsible government.  The dismissal must be based on a loss of legislative support, not on the Governor's personal judgment.  The Governor's role is to uphold the constitutional principles, not to exercise arbitrary power.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the appointment of the Chief Minister:**

1. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister irrespective of the party's majority in the State Legislative Assembly.
2. A person who is not a member of the State Legislature can be appointed Chief Minister for a maximum of six months.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Conventionally, the Governor appoints the leader of the majority party in the State Legislative Assembly as the Chief Minister.  However, in situations where no single party has a clear majority (hung assembly), the Governor may exercise discretion, but the appointment still adheres to established constitutional conventions. The Governor's power is limited by constitutional conventions and practices of parliamentary democracy.

Statement 2 is correct.  A person who is not a member of the State Legislature can be appointed as Chief Minister, but only for a period of six months.  Within this timeframe, they must be elected to the State Legislature to continue in office. This provision prevents individuals from holding the highest executive office without legislative representation.  This is a temporary provision, ensuring that the Chief Minister maintains legislative legitimacy.


**9. With reference to the powers and functions of the Chief Minister, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chief Minister allocates portfolios among ministers and can advise the Governor to dismiss a minister.
2. The Chief Minister presides over meetings of the Zonal Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chief Minister holds significant power within the Council of Ministers.  They are responsible for allocating portfolios to ministers and can advise the Governor on the dismissal of a minister who has lost their confidence.  This reflects their role as the head of the government and leader of the Council of Ministers.  These powers are vital for maintaining cohesion and effectiveness within the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chief Minister does not preside over meetings of the Zonal Council.  While the Chief Minister is a member of the Zonal Council, the chairmanship rotates among the Chief Ministers of the states included in that zone.  This reflects the collaborative nature of the Zonal Council's functioning. The Chief Minister's role in the Zonal Council is collaborative, not one of direct leadership.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the relationship between the Governor and the Chief Minister:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Governor.
2. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister in their discretion, irrespective of the legislative majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly, not the Governor. This reflects the principle of responsible government in a parliamentary democracy. The Governor's role is largely ceremonial in this respect.  The Assembly's confidence is the ultimate determinant of the government's survival.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Governor appoints the Chief Minister, they do so according to established constitutional conventions.  Normally, the leader of the majority party in the State Legislative Assembly is appointed.  The Governor's discretion is limited and not arbitrary.  The appointment is guided by the need to ensure a stable and legitimate government. The Governor's role is to ensure the formation of a government that enjoys the confidence of the legislature.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners.
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Indian Constitution.  It comprises the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and, currently, two other Election Commissioners (ECs).  The number of ECs can be increased or decreased by the President, based on the need. The CEC and ECs are appointed by the President.  The CEC holds the highest authority within the ECI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The election schedule for general and by-elections is decided by the Election Commission of India, not the Union Ministry of Law and Justice. The ECI enjoys autonomy in this critical function to ensure free and fair elections. The Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters related to the conduct of elections, but it does not determine the election schedule. The independence of the ECI is crucial for the integrity of the electoral process in India.  The ECI's power to schedule elections is a vital part of its constitutional mandate.  Any interference in this process would undermine the democratic nature of the Indian political system.


**2. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can withhold assent to any bill passed by Parliament, except a Money Bill.
2. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court only after consulting with the Prime Minister.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India, as head of state, possesses the power to either give assent to, withhold assent to, or return a bill (except a Money Bill) passed by Parliament for reconsideration.  This is a crucial check and balance mechanism to prevent the passage of potentially flawed or unconstitutional legislation. The President’s power to withhold assent is a significant aspect of the Indian presidential system. While the President generally acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, they retain the prerogative to withhold assent in exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court judges, this is done in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, not solely the Prime Minister. The consultation process aims to ensure the appointment of highly qualified and impartial judges, maintaining the independence of the judiciary.  The Prime Minister's role is indirect and consultative, not determinative. The independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of India's democratic framework. The process of judicial appointments is designed to safeguard this independence and prevent political influence.


**3. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of a State holds office during the pleasure of the President of India and can be removed by the President at any time.
2. The Governor of a State can promulgate ordinances only when the State Legislative Assembly is not in session.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India and holds office during the President's pleasure.  This means the President can remove the Governor at any time.  While the removal is not arbitrary and usually follows some convention, the power remains with the President. This reflects the unitary nature of some aspects of the Indian federal system, where the Centre maintains ultimate authority over the States.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor of a State possesses the power to promulgate ordinances when the State Legislature is not in session. This power is analogous to the President's ordinance-making power at the national level.  However, these ordinances must be approved by the State Legislature within six weeks of its re-assembly; otherwise, they lapse.  This is a temporary legislative tool used in emergencies or pressing situations when the Legislature is not functioning.  The limitation on the duration of ordinances ensures that the executive does not bypass the legislative process indefinitely.


**4. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.
2. The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  According to Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, a Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. This reflects the principle of financial supremacy of the Lower House, which is directly elected by the people. The Lok Sabha's primary responsibility is to control government expenditure. The Rajya Sabha's role in financial matters is limited to reviewing the Money Bill, but it cannot amend or reject it. The Lok Sabha has the final say on the passage of Money Bills.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not possess the power to reject a Money Bill. While the Rajya Sabha can consider the Money Bill and suggest amendments, the Lok Sabha can accept or reject these suggestions. The Rajya Sabha cannot hold up or prevent the passage of a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha's decision on the Money Bill is final. This reflects the principle of financial supremacy of the Lower House, which is directly elected by the people and accountable to them for the country's finances.


**5. With reference to the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32) guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights.
2.  The Right to Equality (Article 14-18) prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth only in matters of public employment and not in private employment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights. This right is considered the "heart and soul" of the Constitution, as it empowers citizens to seek judicial redressal for any violation of their Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review to determine the constitutionality of laws and actions of the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Right to Equality, enshrined in Articles 14-18 of the Constitution, prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth in various spheres, including public employment and access to public places.  The prohibition against discrimination extends to both public and private employment in many cases, as interpreted by the courts.  While there may be some exceptions based on reasonable classifications, the principle of non-discrimination is broadly applicable to both public and private sectors.  The courts have consistently upheld the application of Articles 14 and 15 to private entities in many situations.


**6. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts of law.
2. DPSPs are intended to create a welfare state by outlining the social and economic goals that the State should strive to achieve.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, are non-justiciable. This means that they are not legally enforceable by courts.  They serve as guidelines for the State to formulate policies and legislation aimed at achieving social and economic justice.  However, the courts have, in some cases, interpreted fundamental rights in light of the DPSPs, giving them some indirect influence on judicial decisions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPSPs aim to establish a welfare state in India. They provide a blueprint for social and economic development, outlining goals such as providing adequate means of livelihood, ensuring equal pay for equal work, promoting educational and economic opportunities, and protecting the interests of weaker sections of society.  They reflect the social and economic philosophy of the Constitution's framers, aiming for a just and equitable society. While not directly enforceable, they guide government policy and influence public discourse on social and economic issues.


**7. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Constitution.
2. The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to only the All India Services and not for other central government services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Indian Constitution. It is an independent and impartial body responsible for recruiting civil servants for the Union Government and some state governments. The UPSC plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and impartiality of the civil services.  Its independence is safeguarded through constitutional provisions that protect its members from arbitrary removal or influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UPSC's role extends beyond recruitment to the All India Services (IAS, IPS, IFS). It also conducts examinations for recruitment to various other central government services and posts. The UPSC's responsibility encompasses a wide range of services crucial to the functioning of the Union Government.  Its role in maintaining a merit-based and transparent recruitment system is vital for the efficiency and effectiveness of the government.


**8. With reference to the Attorney General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Attorney General is a member of both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India under Article 76 of the Constitution.  The Attorney General is the highest law officer of the country and advises the government on legal matters. They represent the government in the Supreme Court and other courts.  The appointment reflects the executive's authority in legal matters, but the Attorney General's role is also to ensure the legality and constitutionality of government actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Attorney General for India is not a member of either House of Parliament.  While they can participate in parliamentary proceedings and offer legal opinions, they do not have voting rights and are not subject to parliamentary oversight in the same way as elected members. Their role is to advise the government and represent it in legal matters, maintaining a degree of independence from the legislative process.  The independence of the Attorney General is crucial to ensure objective legal advice to the government.


**9. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. PRIs are established under Part IX of the Constitution.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in PRIs, but not for women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are established under Part IX of the Indian Constitution, added through the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992. This part deals with the organization of village panchayats and provides a constitutional basis for their functioning as units of self-government.  This amendment was a landmark step towards decentralizing power and empowering local communities.  The establishment of PRIs at the village, intermediate, and district levels is a significant aspect of India's democratic structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, mandates reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in PRIs, and also for women.  One-third of the total number of seats in PRIs are reserved for women.  This reservation is aimed at ensuring representation for marginalized communities and promoting gender equality in local governance.  The reservation provisions are a crucial element of the empowerment of SCs, STs, and women in rural India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the Indian President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can appoint the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, but their removal requires a parliamentary impeachment process.
2.  The President's power to promulgate ordinances is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court to ensure they align with the Constitution's fundamental principles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Chief Justice and Supreme Court judges, their removal is not solely dependent on a parliamentary impeachment process.  Judges can also be removed through the procedure laid out in Article 124(4) of the Constitution, which involves a motion passed by both houses of Parliament and supported by a special majority.  Impeachment is a separate, more rigorous process usually reserved for serious misconduct.

Statement 2 is correct.  Although the President has the power to promulgate ordinances, the Supreme Court has the authority to judicially review these ordinances to ensure they are not inconsistent with the Constitution’s provisions or fundamental rights.  The court can declare an ordinance void if it deems it unconstitutional. This judicial review acts as a check on the executive's power.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, meaning a vote of no confidence in the Lok Sabha can lead to the resignation of the entire Council.
2.  The Prime Minister's appointment is solely at the discretion of the President, without any requirement for the Prime Minister to demonstrate majority support in the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility holds the entire Council of Ministers accountable to the Lok Sabha. If the Lok Sabha passes a vote of no confidence against the government, the entire Council must resign.  This ensures the executive branch remains answerable to the legislature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Prime Minister, this appointment is not entirely at the President's discretion.  Conventionally, and in practice, the President appoints the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The Prime Minister must demonstrate the ability to secure the confidence of the Lok Sabha to effectively govern.


**3. With reference to the Attorney-General of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Attorney-General holds office during the pleasure of the President and possesses the same qualifications as are required for a Supreme Court Judge.
2. The Attorney-General's primary responsibility is to represent the government in the Supreme Court and High Courts but has no legislative role in Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Attorney-General of India is appointed by the President and holds office during the President's pleasure.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly state they must have the same qualifications as a Supreme Court Judge,  in practice, the appointment is made considering high legal expertise and experience, essentially meeting the same high standards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Attorney-General's role extends beyond representing the government in courts. They can also participate in parliamentary proceedings, offering advice and opinions on legal matters.  Although they cannot vote,  their participation contributes to the legislative process.


**4. With reference to the Union Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget is presented annually to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously, ensuring equal scrutiny by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
2. The President of India plays a crucial role in the budget process, as the budget cannot be introduced in Parliament without their prior recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union Budget is presented first to the Lok Sabha, and the Rajya Sabha’s role is limited to discussing and making recommendations, but they cannot amend the budget.  The Lok Sabha holds primary power over financial matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 113 of the Constitution mandates that no money bill can be introduced in Parliament without the President's prior recommendation. This ensures the executive branch plays a pivotal role in the financial matters of the nation.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power to grant pardons:**

1. The President's power to grant pardons extends to all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a court-martial, irrespective of whether it's a Union or State law.
2.  The President's decision on mercy petitions is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President's pardoning power, as per Article 72, specifically includes cases where the punishment is by a court-martial.  This power is not limited by whether the offense is against a Union or State law.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can interpret the scope of the President's pardoning power, the Court cannot directly review the President’s decision on a mercy petition. This is because the power of pardon is considered a discretionary power of the executive and is not subject to judicial review in the same way as legislative or administrative actions.


**6. With reference to the Parliament's sessions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President has the sole authority to summon and prorogue sessions of Parliament, exercising their discretion in scheduling parliamentary proceedings.
2.  Parliament can be dissolved only by the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, after the Lok Sabha loses a vote of no confidence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President summons and prorogues Parliament, this is done in accordance with established conventions and usually upon the advice of the Prime Minister.  The President doesn't exercise independent discretion in this matter.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house and representing the people directly, holds the power to bring down the government through a vote of no confidence. The President, upon the advice of the Prime Minister, would then dissolve Parliament, leading to fresh elections.


**7. With reference to the process of bill passage in Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. A Money Bill can originate only in the Lok Sabha and cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha.
2. The President's assent is mandatory for all bills passed by Parliament, including Money Bills, to become law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 110 of the Constitution defines a Money Bill and stipulates that it can only originate in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final say.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's assent is usually required, it's not mandatory for a Money Bill.  The President must give assent to a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha, even if the Rajya Sabha has rejected it. The President’s role is largely formal in this case and they cannot reject a money bill.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's powers:**

1. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends only to disputes between the Union and States or between two or more States.
2. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, enabling it to declare laws passed by Parliament or State Legislatures as unconstitutional.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 131 outlines the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. It primarily deals with disputes between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or more States.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is a cornerstone of India's constitutional framework. This power allows the court to determine the constitutionality of laws and actions of the government, ensuring adherence to the Constitution's fundamental principles and safeguarding citizens' rights.


**9. With reference to the Governor's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President but only if the bill affects the interests of the Union.
2.  The Governor has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against a State law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor can reserve a bill for the President's consideration, but it's not limited to bills affecting Union interests.  The Governor has discretion to reserve a bill under certain circumstances, even if it primarily concerns state matters.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 161 grants the Governor the power to pardon or commute sentences for offenses against State laws. This mirrors the President's power at the national level (Article 72).  This power is significant in ensuring fairness and justice within the state's jurisdiction.


**10. With reference to the Vice-President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vice-President is elected by an electoral college consisting of only elected members of both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The Vice-President acts as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and can only be removed from office through a resolution passed by a majority of all members of the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electoral college for the Vice-President includes both elected and nominated members of both Houses of Parliament.  This differs from the Presidential election where only elected members participate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Vice-President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, their removal requires a resolution passed by a majority of all then members of the Rajya Sabha and agreed to by the Lok Sabha.  It is not solely a Rajya Sabha process.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India is a single-member body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner.  
2. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice decides the election schedule for the conduct of both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and can have up to two other Election Commissioners. However, currently, it's often a single-member body.  The CEC is appointed by the President of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Election Commission of India itself is responsible for deciding the election schedule, not the Ministry of Law and Justice or any other ministry. The ECI enjoys autonomy in this crucial aspect of its functions. The Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters related to the functioning of the ECI.


**2. Consider the following statements about the President's rule in a State:**

1. Proclamation of President’s rule automatically dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. The President's rule suspends all fundamental rights in the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's rule (Article 356) often leads to the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, it is not automatic. The President can choose to keep the Assembly in place, depending on the circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's rule does not automatically suspend all fundamental rights in a state.  While certain rights may be restricted during an emergency, the suspension of fundamental rights is governed by separate provisions of the Constitution and is not an automatic consequence of President's rule.


**3. With reference to the features of Indian Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian federal structure is characterized by a rigid constitution, making amendments difficult.
2.  The distribution of powers between the Centre and States is asymmetric, with unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution is a quasi-federal one, meaning it has elements of both federal and unitary systems. The amendment process, while requiring special majorities, is not so rigid as to be considered completely inflexible. The flexibility is designed to allow for adaptation to changing circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian federation is asymmetric because the states have unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) based on their population.  This leads to an uneven distribution of power and influence between larger and smaller states.


**4. With reference to the parliamentary form of government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The executive is responsible to the legislature, ensuring accountability.
2. The head of state is also the head of government, combining both roles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In India's parliamentary system, the executive branch (Council of Ministers) is accountable to the legislature (Parliament). The Lok Sabha (House of the People) can remove the government through a vote of no confidence. This ensures a degree of checks and balances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In India, the President is the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government. These are distinct roles with different functions and powers. The President is a largely ceremonial figure, while the Prime Minister holds executive authority.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Parliament of India:**

1. Private member bills are bills introduced by MPs who are not ministers.
2. A private member's bill can only be passed if it receives the support of the ruling party.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Private member bills are indeed introduced by MPs who are not members of the Council of Ministers. These bills often deal with diverse issues and represent the interests of individual MPs and their constituencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it is true that the passage of any bill, including private member bills, is often influenced by the ruling party's support,  it's not a strict requirement. A private member's bill can pass even without the ruling party's support if it gains sufficient majority in both Houses.  The support of the ruling party may significantly enhance the bill's chances but it is not a mandatory condition.


**6. With reference to the office of the Governor in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Chief Minister of the concerned state.
2. The Governor can reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Governor is appointed by the President of India, but not on the recommendation of the Chief Minister of the state. The appointment is based on advice from the Union Council of Ministers.  The Chief Minister's opinion might be considered, but it is not a formal requirement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor has the power to reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the President’s consideration. This power is primarily used for bills that may have constitutional implications or are at odds with national policy.



**7. Consider the following statements regarding the judicial review in India:**

1. Judicial review enables the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of laws and executive orders.
2. The Supreme Court can question the wisdom or expediency of laws enacted by the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Judicial review is a cornerstone of India's legal system. It empowers the Supreme Court to determine whether a law or government action is consistent with the Constitution.  If found unconstitutional, the Court can strike down the law or order.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can certainly examine the legality of laws, it does not have the power to question the wisdom or policy behind legislative decisions.  The Court focuses on whether the law violates constitutional principles, not on whether it is a good or bad policy choice.  The legislature is responsible for making policy decisions.


**8. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG submits its audit reports directly to the President of India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG submits its audit reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament. This ensures parliamentary oversight of government finances and accountability.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's audit mandate extends to all government companies, regardless of whether they are wholly or partially owned by the government. This broad scope ensures scrutiny of public funds utilized by various entities.


**9. With reference to the Aadhaar card in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar card can be used as a proof of citizenship.
2. Aadhaar number, once issued, cannot be deactivated by the issuing authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar is a crucial identity document, it does not serve as proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal processes. Aadhaar primarily verifies an individual's identity and demographic details.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadhaar numbers can be deactivated under certain circumstances, such as suspected fraud or if the individual requests deactivation. The issuing authority, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), retains the power to manage and update Aadhaar records.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Privacy in India:**

1. The right to privacy is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India has recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned as a separate fundamental right in the original text of the Indian Constitution.  However, through judicial interpretation, the Supreme Court has recognized and protected it.

Statement 2 is correct.  In the landmark *Puttaswamy* judgment, the Supreme Court of India held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) of the Constitution.  This decision significantly expanded the scope of fundamental rights.


**11. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT has the power to hear appeals against the decisions of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
2. The NGT is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is also correct. The NGT was established by the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, an Act of Parliament.  It is not a constitutional body, but a statutory one deriving its powers from the legislation.


**12. With reference to the local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with urban local governments.
2.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act mandates the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system in all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, provides constitutional status and framework for urban local bodies (municipalities).  It aims to strengthen and empower urban governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, aims to establish Panchayati Raj institutions, it doesn't mandate a strict three-tier system in all states. The structure of Panchayati Raj is flexible and can vary based on state-specific needs and circumstances. Some states might have more or fewer tiers.

1. The Union Budget is presented in the Parliament by the Finance Minister.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Minister of India presents the Union Budget to the Parliament. This is a crucial event in the Indian financial year, outlining the government's revenue and expenditure plans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) cannot amend a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha (House of the People) can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills.


**14. With reference to the Governor's power to promulgate ordinances, consider the following statements:**

1. Ordinances can be issued only when the State Legislative Assembly is not in session.
2. Ordinances have the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A Governor can only promulgate an ordinance when the State Legislative Assembly is not in session. This is a crucial limitation on the ordinance-making power, preventing its misuse during normal legislative functioning.

Statement 2 is also correct. An ordinance has the same force and effect as an Act of the State Legislature, but it remains subject to certain limitations.  It must be approved by the legislature within a specified period, or it lapses.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Directive Principles of State Policy are not justiciable, unlike fundamental rights.  They are guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies but cannot be enforced through courts.

Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs form the core of the welfare state ideal in the Indian Constitution.  They aim to ensure social and economic justice, reduce inequalities, and promote the well-being of citizens.  They serve as guiding principles for government policy and action.
