**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                       Key Figure/Entity
1. Government of India Act, 1858                 :   Board of Control abolished
2. Indian Councils Act, 1861                     :   Introduction of portfolio system
3. Indian Councils Act, 1892                     :   Direct elections introduced
4. Morley-Minto Reforms (Indian Councils Act, 1909):   Satyendra Prasad Sinha joined Viceroy's Executive Council
5. Government of India Act, 1919                 :  Dyarchy introduced in provinces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1858 ended the dual control system established by Pitt's India Act, transferring power from the East India Company to the Crown and effectively abolishing the Board of Control.  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 introduced the portfolio system, where members of the Governor-General's Executive Council headed different departments. The Morley-Minto Reforms (Indian Councils Act, 1909) saw Satyendra Prasad Sinha become the first Indian to join the Viceroy's Executive Council. The Government of India Act, 1919 introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance in the provinces.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Indian Councils Act of 1892 introduced indirect elections, not direct elections. Option (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian administrative system under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Administrative Reform/Act                       Impact/Consequence
1. Cornwallis's reforms (1786-93)               :   Complete separation of judicial and revenue functions at the district level
2. Lord Mayo's financial decentralisation (1870) :   Provincial governments gained complete financial autonomy
3. Lord Ripon's local self-government policy (1882):   Majority of local body members were directly elected
4. Government of India Act, 1935               :   Abolition of dyarchy in provinces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Cornwallis's reforms significantly separated the revenue and judicial functions at the district level, although complete separation wasn't achieved immediately.  The Government of India Act of 1935 did abolish dyarchy in the provinces, replacing it with provincial autonomy. Lord Mayo's financial decentralization gave provinces more control over certain services' finances, but not complete autonomy.  Lord Ripon's policy aimed for a non-official majority in local bodies, but elections weren't universally implemented, and official control remained significant.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the described impacts of the administrative reforms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy in India                         Characteristic Feature
1. Divide and Rule                               :   Encouraged cooperation between Hindus and Muslims
2. Policy towards Zamindars after 1857         :   Suppression of Zamindari power
3. Educational Policy in early 19th Century      :  Emphasis on mass education in vernacular languages
4.  British foreign policy in India                : Primarily focused on internal development of India.
5.  Response to Educated Indians Post-1857      : Active encouragement of higher education.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

The British "Divide and Rule" policy actively fostered divisions among various groups in India, including religious and caste-based differences, directly contradicting the statement in pair 1.  Their policy towards Zamindars after 1857 was largely one of appeasement and maintaining their support, not suppression. The early 19th-century educational policy emphasized English-medium education for a select group to serve administrative needs, neglecting mass education and vernacular languages. British foreign policy in India was heavily influenced by imperial interests and aimed at protecting and expanding British influence in the region, not exclusively focused on internal development. The British response to educated Indians post-1857 was initially one of hostility and suspicion, as their nationalist leanings were seen as a threat. Hence, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS) under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                                     Characteristic
1. Establishment of Fort William College (1800) :  Successful long-term training institution for ICS officers
2. Charter Act of 1853                            :   Abolition of the ICS
3. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861              :   Examination held exclusively in India
4. Lee Commission (1924)                       :   Recommended complete exclusion of Indians from ICS
5.  Post-1918 Indianisation of ICS                :  Indians gained complete control over ICS administration

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) None
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) None

**Explanation:**

The Fort William College was short-lived, replaced by Haileybury College. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced competitive examinations, not abolition. The 1861 Act held the examination in England, not India. The Lee Commission pushed for Indianisation, the opposite of complete exclusion. Post-1918 Indianisation did not grant complete control; significant power remained in British hands. Thus, none of the pairs accurately represent the characteristics of the events or acts related to the Indian Civil Service.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Primary Focus
1. Vernacular Press Act, 1878                     :   Promoting freedom of the Indian press
2. Indian Factory Act, 1881                       :   Regulating working conditions in tea plantations
3. Indian Police Act, 1861                        :   Decentralizing police administration
4. Government of India Act, 1919                  :  Establishing complete provincial autonomy.
5.  Government of India Act, 1935                 :  Creating a fully functioning All-India Federation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) None
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) None

**Explanation:**

The Vernacular Press Act aimed to curb, not promote, freedom of the press. The 1881 Factory Act primarily focused on child labor, not tea plantations (which remained largely unregulated). The 1861 Police Act standardized police structure, not decentralization.  The 1919 Act introduced dyarchy, not complete autonomy. The 1935 Act aimed for an All-India Federation, but it never fully materialized due to political opposition.  Therefore, no pair is correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to be plausible based on general knowledge of the period but are incorrect in the context of the specific acts' main focus.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                     Key Figure/Provision
1. Regulating Act of 1773                     :   Establishment of a Supreme Court in Calcutta
2. Pitt's India Act of 1784                     :   Abolition of the East India Company's trade monopoly
3. Charter Act of 1813                         :   Introduction of a Law Member to the Governor-General's Council
4. Charter Act of 1853                         :   Introduction of competitive examinations for civil services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Regulating Act of 1773 is correctly paired with the establishment of a Supreme Court in Calcutta. This was a significant step towards establishing a formal judicial system in British India.  The Charter Act of 1853 is correctly linked to the introduction of competitive examinations for civil services. This marked a shift from patronage-based appointments to a meritocratic system, although the impact on Indian participation was limited initially.

Option (d) is incorrect because Pitt's India Act of 1784 did *not* abolish the East India Company's trade monopoly; it established the Board of Control to oversee the Company's activities.  The Charter Act of 1813 ended the Company's monopoly on trade with India (except for tea and trade with China), not the 1784 act.  The Charter Act of 1833, not the 1813 act, introduced a Law Member to the Governor-General's Council as part of efforts to centralize administration and improve lawmaking.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to these factual inaccuracies. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring candidates to differentiate between similar but distinct historical events and their features.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian administrative system under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Viceroy                     Significant Administrative Reform
1. Warren Hastings                             :   Introduction of the Ryotwari system
2. Lord Cornwallis                              :   Establishment of a regular police force
3. Lord William Bentinck                       :   Abolition of Sati
4. Lord Dalhousie                               :   Implementation of the Permanent Settlement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Cornwallis is correctly paired with the establishment of a regular police force. He implemented significant reforms in the police system, aiming for greater efficiency and control. Lord William Bentinck is accurately linked to the abolition of Sati.  His administration played a crucial role in enacting legislation to abolish this practice.

Option (a) is incorrect because Warren Hastings is not directly associated with the introduction of the Ryotwari system; that system was primarily associated with Thomas Munro in the Madras Presidency. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because Lord Dalhousie is not primarily associated with the implementation of the Permanent Settlement; that was primarily Lord Cornwallis's work.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the administrative contributions of key figures in British India.  The options provide plausible distractors by including figures associated with other significant reforms, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between individuals and their specific accomplishments.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Acts, consider the following pairs:**

    Act                                          Key Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1858             :   Established a Secretary of State for India
2. Indian Councils Act, 1861                   :   Introduced bicameral legislature at the centre
3. Government of India Act, 1919             :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4. Government of India Act, 1935             :   Established Provincial Autonomy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1858 is correctly paired with the establishment of the Secretary of State for India.  This Act transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, with the Secretary of State becoming the key figure responsible to the British Parliament. The Indian Councils Act of 1919 introduced dyarchy in the provinces, a system of dual governance with both elected and nominated members.  The Government of India Act of 1935 established provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to the provinces.

Option (a) is incorrect because the Indian Councils Act of 1861 did *not* introduce a bicameral legislature at the centre; that happened later with the Government of India Act of 1919. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key features of several Government of India Acts, requiring careful differentiation between the provisions of different acts.  The distractors make the question challenging, as candidates need to accurately recall the specific details of each act to identify the correct pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                                    Region of Implementation
1. Ryotwari System                               :   Bengal Presidency
2. Permanent Settlement                           :   Madras Presidency
3. Mahalwari System                              :   North-Western Provinces
4. Zamindari System                               :   Bombay Presidency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Mahalwari System is correctly paired with its primary region of implementation, the North-Western Provinces. This system, which involved revenue collection from village communities, was implemented in parts of northern India.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the Ryotwari system was implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, not Bengal.  The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of other regions, not Madras. The Zamindari system, while having some similarities to the Permanent Settlement, wasn't solely implemented in the Bombay Presidency.  This question tests detailed knowledge of land revenue systems under British rule and their geographical distribution. The incorrect options are plausible distractors, as each revenue system was implemented in multiple regions, requiring precise understanding of the primary areas of their implementation.


**5.  With reference to the British Indian Army, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform/Policy                                 Rationale/Outcome
1.  One-third White Army policy                  : To increase Indian representation in the officer ranks
2.  Divide and rule policy in recruitment        : To maintain balance between different communities
3.  Restriction on nationalist publications       : To prevent the spread of seditious ideas among soldiers
4.  Introduction of caste and communal companies: To promote inter-communal harmony

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The divide-and-rule policy in recruitment to the British Indian Army aimed to maintain a balance between different communities, preventing the formation of a unified force that could pose a threat to British rule.  Restricting nationalist publications from reaching soldiers was a direct attempt to prevent the spread of seditious ideas and maintain loyalty to the British Crown.

Option (b) is incorrect; the "One-third White Army" policy aimed to ensure a significant European presence in the army to maintain control, not to increase Indian representation in the officer ranks. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pair 1, and 4. The introduction of caste and communal companies was designed to exploit existing divisions, not promote harmony.  This question tests understanding of the British military policies in India and their underlying motives. The distractors challenge candidates to differentiate between the actual aims and outcomes of these policies, requiring a deeper level of understanding beyond surface-level knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy in India                         Primary Aim
1.  Subsidary Alliance                           :  To establish British political supremacy
2.  Policy of Annexation                          :   To expand British territory directly
3.  Doctrine of Lapse                             :   To secure succession in Indian states
4.  Paramountcy                                   :   To establish a federation with Indian states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Subsidiary Alliance was a key British policy aimed at establishing political supremacy over Indian states by forcing them into a dependent relationship.  The policy of annexation directly expanded British territory through conquest and incorporation of Indian states.  The Doctrine of Lapse was used to secure succession in Indian states, allowing the British to annex states where there was no clear heir.

Option (d) is incorrect because Paramountcy was not primarily aimed at establishing a federation with Indian states; while the 1935 Act proposed such a federation, Paramountcy itself represented British supremacy over the princely states.  This question tests knowledge of different British policies towards Indian states and their strategic objectives.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of British imperial policies, requiring precise knowledge of each policy's primary aim.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                  Provision/Consequence
1. Government of India Act, 1858            :   Established the Secretary of State for India
2. Indian Councils Act, 1861                 :   Introduced portfolio system in the Executive Council
3. Indian Councils Act, 1909                 :   Increased the number of non-official members in the Imperial Legislative Council
4. Government of India Act, 1919             :   Introduced dyarchy in the provinces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1858 transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, establishing the position of the Secretary of State for India, responsible to the British Parliament.  This is a core fact about the Act. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did expand the Governor-General's Council, but the introduction of the portfolio system happened later, under Lord Canning.  The Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) significantly increased non-official representation in the Imperial Legislative Council, a key feature of the reforms. Finally, the Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms) introduced the system of dyarchy, dividing powers between Indian ministers and British officials in provinces.  Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly attributes the portfolio system to the 1861 Act. Option (c) is incomplete. Option (d) is partially correct but omits the significant expansion of the legislative council in the 1909 Act.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian administrative system under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Administrative Reform/Act                  Key Feature
1. Cornwallis' reforms                         :   Abolished the dual system of government
2. Pitt's India Act, 1784                     :   Established the Board of Control
3. Lord Mayo's reforms                        :   Introduced financial decentralization
4. Indian Councils Act, 1861                 :   Established provincial legislative councils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pitt's India Act of 1784 established the Board of Control to oversee the East India Company's affairs, a crucial step in increasing British control over India's administration.  Lord Mayo's financial decentralization reforms aimed to improve efficiency and reduce conflict between central and provincial governments by granting fixed sums to provinces for specific services. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 established legislative councils in Bombay, Madras, and Bengal, marking a significant step towards legislative devolution, although these councils had limited powers.  Cornwallis' reforms are associated with the establishment of a more structured and efficient civil service, not the abolition of the dual system (which predates his governorship). The dual system was a feature of the pre-Regulating Act period in Bengal. Thus, option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings related to Cornwallis and the dual system.


**3. With reference to the British administrative structure in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Level of Government                     Characteristic Feature
1. Central Government                       :   Complete subordination to the Secretary of State
2. Provincial Governments                  :   Enjoyed considerable autonomy before 1833
3. Local Bodies (Municipalities and District Boards) :   Initially comprised mostly nominated members

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Central Government under British rule was ultimately answerable to and controlled by the Secretary of State for India in London. This ensured that Indian administration served British interests.  Provincial governments did indeed enjoy greater autonomy before 1833, when the central government significantly increased control over their legislative and financial powers.  Local bodies, initially created to aid in tax collection and the implementation of certain services, were largely comprised of nominated members, lacking significant representation from elected officials. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to acknowledge the accuracy of all three pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Governor-General/Viceroy       Significant Administrative Action
1. Lord Cornwallis                          :   Introduction of the Ryotwari system
2. Lord Wellesley                           :   Establishment of Fort William College
3. Lord Dalhousie                           :   Implementation of the Permanent Settlement
4. Lord Curzon                              :   Partition of Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Wellesley is correctly paired with the establishment of Fort William College in Calcutta, aiming to improve the training of civil servants. Lord Curzon is correctly linked to the controversial Partition of Bengal in 1905.  The Permanent Settlement was primarily associated with Lord Cornwallis, while the Ryotwari system was developed and implemented primarily under Thomas Munro in Madras Presidency. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings concerning the implementation of the Permanent and Ryotwari systems.


**5. With reference to the British Indian Army, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Event                                  Characteristic Feature
1. Post-1857 reorganization                   :   Increased proportion of European troops
2. Policy of "divide and rule"                 :   Recruitment based on "martial" and "non-martial" race classifications
3. Introduction of communal companies        :   To foster inter-communal harmony among soldiers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Following the 1857 revolt, the British significantly increased the proportion of European troops in the Indian Army to maintain control and prevent future uprisings. The "divide and rule" policy was implemented through discriminatory recruitment practices, classifying communities as "martial" or "non-martial," thereby preventing the formation of a unified and potentially rebellious force. The introduction of communal companies was designed to create divisions within the army, not to foster harmony. Thus, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect because the introduction of communal companies was to divide the army, not promote harmony. Option (d) is incorrect due to the flawed pairing in point 3.


**6. With reference to the evolution of the Indian judicial system under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

    Judicial Reform/Act                            Key Feature
1. Warren Hastings' reforms                      :   Establishment of the Supreme Court at Calcutta
2. Cornwallis' reforms                            :   Separation of revenue and judicial administration
3. Macaulay's Law Commission                    :   Codification of Indian laws

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Regulating Act of 1773, enacted during Warren Hastings' tenure, established the Supreme Court at Calcutta. Cornwallis's judicial reforms were significant for separating revenue and judicial functions, improving the administration of justice.  Macaulay's Law Commission played a crucial role in codifying Indian laws, resulting in landmark codes like the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because the Supreme Court was established by the Regulating Act of 1773 not by Warren Hastings' reforms. Option (c) is partially correct but ignores the significant contribution of Macaulay's Law Commission. Option (d) is incorrect because the Supreme Court was established by the Regulating Act of 1773.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy in India                          Characteristic Feature
1.  Divide and Rule                               :   Promoting communal harmony
2.  Hostility towards educated Indians          :   Suppression of nationalist movements
3.  Patronage of Zamindars and Landlords       :   Empowering peasant uprisings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The British "divide and rule" policy actively fostered divisions within Indian society, not communal harmony.  The British displayed hostility towards educated Indians who led nationalist movements, actively suppressing such movements through various means.  The British actively patronized zamindars and landlords, using them as a counterweight against the nationalist movement, not empowering peasant uprisings.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect characterizations of British policies.


**8. With reference to British economic policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                                    Key Feature
1. Permanent Settlement                              :   Direct assessment of land revenue from individual cultivators
2. Ryotwari System                                  :   Fixed revenue demand from Zamindars
3. Mahalwari System                                :   Revenue assessment based on village communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement involved a fixed revenue demand from Zamindars, not individual cultivators. The Ryotwari System involved direct assessment from individual cultivators, not Zamindars. The Mahalwari System did indeed involve revenue assessment based on village communities. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect characterizations of the key features of the various revenue systems.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                      Implementation Detail
1.  Divide and Rule                           :   Princes pitted against states' people
2.  Policy towards Zamindars                 :   Lands of Awadh taluqdars restored
3.  Attitude towards Social Reforms          :   Support withdrawn after 1857
4.  Labour Legislation                        :   First Factory Act passed in 1881
5.  Restrictions on the Press                :   Vernacular Press Act, 1878

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The British employed a "divide and rule" strategy, exacerbating existing divisions within Indian society to maintain control.  The restoration of lands to Awadh taluqdars exemplifies their appeasement of the Zamindar class. Their shift in attitude toward social reforms after 1857 reflects a calculated move to align with conservative elements. The passage clearly mentions the enactment of the first Factory Act in 1881, demonstrating their response (albeit inadequate) to labor conditions. Finally, the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 represents a direct attempt to curb the freedom of the Indian press.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of option (c) accurately reflects the British administrative policies detailed in the provided text.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                       Area of Implementation
1. Permanent Settlement                 :   Entire British India
2. Ryotwari System                        :   Madras Presidency only
3. Mahalwari System                      :   North-Western Provinces only
4.  Hastings’ Izaredari System            :   Bengal and Bihar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair relating Hastings' Izaredari System to Bengal and Bihar is entirely accurate. The Permanent Settlement, while initially implemented in Bengal, was later extended to other regions.  The Ryotwari system was implemented in Madras, but also in other areas. The Mahalwari system was used in North-Western Provinces, but also in other parts of Northern India.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the overgeneralization of the geographical extent of the revenue systems.  Option (d) correctly identifies the only fully accurate pairing provided. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the nuances of land revenue systems and their precise geographical application during British rule in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Official/Policy                  Action/Outcome
1.  Lord Cornwallis                        :   Introduced Ryotwari System
2.  Lord Metcalfe                           :   Lifted restrictions on Indian press in 1835
3.  Lord Lytton                             :   Enacted the Vernacular Press Act, 1878
4.  Lord Curzon                            :   Introduced Mahalwari System

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairings of Lord Metcalfe with the lifting of press restrictions in 1835 and Lord Lytton with the enactment of the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 are correct. Lord Cornwallis is associated with the Permanent Settlement, not the Ryotwari System. Lord Curzon is not linked to the introduction of the Mahalwari system; it predates his tenure. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect, as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's ability to link specific British officials with their actions and policies during British rule in India, requiring detailed factual recall.


**4. With reference to British Policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                              Specific Legislation/Event
1.  Factory Labour                          :  The Indian Factory Act of 1891
2.  Plantation Labour                      :  Penal laws passed between 1863 and 1882
3.  Press Freedom                           :  Repeal of the Vernacular Press Act in 1882
4.  Revenue Administration                 :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System in 1820

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Indian Factory Act of 1891 is a landmark piece of legislation addressing factory labour conditions. Penal laws were indeed enacted between 1863 and 1882 to control plantation labor. The repeal of the Vernacular Press Act in 1882 signifies a period of relative press freedom. The introduction of the Ryotwari system in 1820 is also historically accurate. Option (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect as they understate the number of correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because it negates the accurate matches.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the specifics of British legislative actions and their impact on various sectors of Indian society.


**5. With reference to the British Raj, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Viceroy             Significant Policy/Action
1.  Lord Dalhousie                         :  Implementation of the Mahalwari System
2.  Lord William Bentinck                  :  Introduction of the Ryotwari System
3.  Lord Curzon                            :  Partition of Bengal
4.  Lord Lytton                            :  Enactment of the Vernacular Press Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs associating Lord Curzon with the Partition of Bengal and Lord Lytton with the Vernacular Press Act are accurately matched.  Lord Dalhousie is not primarily known for implementing the Mahalwari system, although he did make adjustments to it. Lord William Bentinck is associated with social reforms and the abolition of Sati, not the introduction of the Ryotwari system. Option (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question requires the candidate to accurately recall specific historical events and link them to the relevant Governor-Generals/Viceroys, demanding detailed factual knowledge and analytical ability to eliminate incorrect pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Act/Policy                     Impact on Indian Society/Economy
1. Permanent Settlement                  :   Led to the growth of absentee landlordism
2. Ryotwari System                       :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators
3. Mahalwari System                      :   Revenue assessment based on the village community
4. Vernacular Press Act, 1878           :   Curbed the freedom of the Indian language press
5. Indian Factory Act, 1881              :   Restricted working hours for children to 9 hours

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Permanent Settlement, while intending to create a stable land revenue system, inadvertently led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few zamindars, many of whom were absentee landlords. The Ryotwari System, implemented in several parts of India, involved the direct collection of land revenue from individual cultivators. The Mahalwari System, prevalent in parts of North India, assessed revenue based on the village community as a unit. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to control the growing influence of the vernacular press, which was often critical of British rule. Finally, the Indian Factory Act of 1881 was a landmark legislation that addressed the issue of child labour in factories by restricting their working hours.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  These options represent potential misconceptions or a lack of complete understanding of the impact of these British policies and acts. The comprehensive nature of option (c) demonstrates a thorough grasp of the subject matter.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Governor-General/Viceroy       Significant Policy/Event
1. Lord Cornwallis                       :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System
2. Lord Dalhousie                        :   Implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse
3. Lord Wellesley                         :   Introduction of the Permanent Settlement
4. Lord Curzon                           :   Partition of Bengal
5. Lord Lytton                           :   Implementation of the Vernacular Press Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only Lord Dalhousie is correctly associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy that led to the annexation of several Indian states.  Lord Lytton is correctly linked to the Vernacular Press Act of 1878, which imposed restrictions on the Indian-language press.  The other options are incorrect. Lord Cornwallis is known for the Permanent Settlement, not the Ryotwari System. Lord Wellesley is associated with the Subsidiary Alliance system. While Lord Curzon was Viceroy during the partition of Bengal, the decision was made earlier. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of key figures in British India and their specific policies.  Incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate’s ability to differentiate between similar policies and historical events.


**3.  With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                 Primary Aim
1. Divide and Rule                        :   Prevent a unified Indian resistance
2. Subsidiary Alliance                     :   Expand British territory and control
3. Doctrine of Lapse                       :   Annex Indian states without direct war
4. Policy of Masterly Inactivity          :   Maintain peace on the North-West Frontier
5. Forward Policy (Lord Auckland)       :   Establish a buffer zone against Russia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the primary aim of the respective British policy. "Divide and Rule" aimed to exploit existing social and religious divisions to weaken any unified opposition to British rule. The "Subsidiary Alliance" was a key tool for expanding British influence and control by stationing British troops in Indian states. The "Doctrine of Lapse" provided a pretext for annexing states without resorting to outright warfare.  "Masterly Inactivity," under John Lawrence, focused on maintaining peace and stability on the volatile North-West Frontier. Lord Auckland's "Forward Policy" aimed to create a buffer zone against the perceived threat of Russian expansion.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of British imperial strategies and their long-term consequences.  The inclusion of all correct pairs in option (c) highlights the comprehensive nature of British imperial policies.  Incorrect options act as effective distractors, testing the depth of the candidate’s understanding.


**4. With reference to the British economic policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                     Consequence
1. Heavy taxation of Indian goods in Britain :   Decline in Indian exports to Britain
2. Free import of British goods into India     :   Ruin of Indian handicrafts
3. Promotion of raw material exports from India:   Dependence on British industries
4. Drain of Wealth                           :   Transfer of Indian resources to Britain
5.  Investment in Railways                   :   Facilitated the movement of British goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly link British economic policies to their consequences in India.  High taxes on Indian goods in Britain severely hampered Indian exports, while the free import of British goods into India led to the decline of Indian handicrafts due to unfair competition. The British emphasis on exporting raw materials from India created a dependence on British industries for manufactured goods. The "Drain of Wealth" refers to the systematic transfer of resources from India to Britain, enriching the latter at the expense of the former.  Investment in railways by the British, while having some positive effects, primarily served to facilitate the transportation of British goods and raw materials within India and to ports for export.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the exploitative nature of British economic policies and their devastating impact on the Indian economy. The inclusion of all correct pairs in option (c) emphasizes the multifaceted nature of this exploitation.  The distractor options test the candidate's ability to critically analyze the complex interplay between British policies and their effects.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Land Revenue System                    Region of Implementation
1. Ryotwari System                       :   Bengal and Bihar
2. Permanent Settlement                  :   Madras Presidency
3. Mahalwari System                      :   North-Western Provinces
4. Zamindari System                      :   Bombay Presidency
5. Ryotwari System                       :   Parts of the Deccan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The Mahalwari system was primarily implemented in the North-Western Provinces, and the Ryotwari system was implemented in parts of the Deccan.  The other options incorrectly pair land revenue systems with their regions of implementation.  The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal and Bihar, not the Madras Presidency. The Ryotwari system was not implemented in Bengal and Bihar. The Zamindari system, while related to the Permanent Settlement, wasn't directly a system in itself, it was a feature of the Permanent Settlement, and  wasn't primarily implemented in the Bombay Presidency. This question tests detailed knowledge of the specific geographical implementation of different land revenue systems in British India, highlighting the nuanced differences in administrative approaches across various regions.  The distractor options showcase the complexities and potential for confusion, requiring a precise understanding of the topic.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Location
1.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre              :   Lahore
2.  Champaran Satyagraha                 :   Bihar
3.  Ahmedabad Mill Strike                 :   Bombay
4.  Chauri Chaura Incident                 :   Gorakhpur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place in Amritsar, Punjab, not Lahore.  Lahore was the site of the Lahore Congress session in 1929, a significant event but not the location of the massacre. The Champaran Satyagraha was indeed in Bihar. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike occurred in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, not Bombay. The Chauri Chaura incident correctly took place in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related but distinct events and locations, a crucial skill for UPSC aspirants.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's knowledge of significant events within the Indian independence movement and their geographical context.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                   Movement/Event
1.  Mustafa Kamal Pasha                   :   Non-Cooperation Movement
2.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel              :   Bardoli Satyagraha
3.  General Dyer                           :   Khilafat Movement
4.  Mahatma Gandhi                        :   Quit India Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mustafa Kamal Pasha was the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, which led to the decline of the Khilafat movement in India, but he was not directly involved in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership in the Bardoli Satyagraha is well-documented, making this a correct pairing. General Dyer was the military commander responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, not directly associated with the Khilafat Movement. Mahatma Gandhi's role in leading the Quit India Movement is also historically accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the leaders associated with specific events.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the interconnectedness of various events within a specific historical period. The distractors are strategically placed to test the candidates' ability to distinguish between significant figures and their roles in different movements within the Indian independence struggle.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session                     Decision/Event
1.  Calcutta Session, 1928            :   Acceptance of Purna Swaraj
2.  Lahore Session, 1929              :   One-year ultimatum to the British Government
3.  Karachi Session, 1931             :   Endorsement of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Calcutta Session of 1928 saw the approval of the Nehru Report, which proposed dominion status, not the acceptance of Purna Swaraj (complete independence). This was adopted at the Lahore Session in 1929. The Lahore Session of 1929 indeed gave a one-year ultimatum to the British government to accept dominion status or face a civil disobedience movement for complete independence. The Karachi Session of 1931 did endorse the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, marking a significant turning point in the national movement.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating the necessity of precise knowledge of Congress sessions and their respective decisions. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the evolution of the Congress's political strategy during the crucial years leading up to independence. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the Congress's evolving stance on independence and its interactions with the British government.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Impact/Consequence
1.  Permanent Settlement                      :   Led to the Ryotwari system in Madras
2.  Ryotwari System                           :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators
3.  Mahalwari System                         :   Revenue assessment based on villages
4.  Vernacular Press Act of 1878             :   Increased freedom of the Indian press


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement, while having its own consequences, did not directly lead to the Ryotwari system. The Ryotwari system was a separate land revenue system implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies. The Ryotwari system’s key feature was indeed the direct collection of land revenue from individual cultivators. The Mahalwari system correctly involved revenue assessment based on villages or groups of villages (Mahals). The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed restrictions on the Indian-language press, the opposite of increased freedom. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the need to understand the distinct features and consequences of various British revenue policies and their impact on Indian society.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the complexities of British revenue policies and their long-term effects on the Indian agrarian structure.  The distractors are designed to evaluate the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar but distinct systems and their consequences.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Description
1.  All-India Federation                     :   Never fully implemented due to princely states' reluctance
2.  Provincial Autonomy                     :   Dyarchy replaced by complete provincial control
3.  Communal Electorates                    :   Separate electorates for religious and caste groups
4.  Federal Legislature                      :   Unicameral system with a powerful lower house


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, proposed an All-India Federation, but it was never fully implemented due to the non-participation of many princely states.  Provincial autonomy did replace dyarchy, giving provinces more control over their affairs.  Communal electorates were a key feature, creating separate electorates for different religious and caste groups. However, the Federal Legislature was bicameral, consisting of the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House), not unicameral.  Thus, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, emphasizing the need for a thorough understanding of the structure and provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of a significant piece of colonial legislation and its impact on the political landscape of India. The distractors are carefully designed to evaluate the candidate's comprehension of the Act's intricacies and potential for misinterpretation.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                      Association/Role
1.  Lord Irwin                                 :   Introduced Purna Swaraj as the Congress goal
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                          :   President of the Lahore Congress Session, 1929
3.  Sir Stafford Cripps                         :   Presented the Cripps Mission proposals
4.  Bhagat Singh                              :   Associated with the Non-Cooperation Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lord Irwin, the Viceroy of India, did not introduce Purna Swaraj as the Congress goal; this was a decision taken by the Congress itself at the Lahore Session. Jawaharlal Nehru was indeed the President of the Lahore Congress Session in 1929.  Sir Stafford Cripps, a British cabinet minister, is correctly associated with the Cripps Mission proposals during World War II.  Bhagat Singh was primarily associated with revolutionary activities and the Hindustan Republican Association, not the Non-Cooperation Movement. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the importance of accurate associations between historical figures and their roles in the Indian independence movement. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and events leading up to and during the struggle for independence.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the specific roles played by these individuals.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper/Publication                     Prominent Figure Associated
1.  Young India                               :   Bal Gangadhar Tilak
2.  Indian Opinion                           :   Mahatma Gandhi
3.  Yugantar                                  :   Subhas Chandra Bose
4.  Kesari                                   :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi was associated with *Young India*, making this an incorrect pairing.  Mahatma Gandhi was indeed associated with *Indian Opinion* during his time in South Africa.  *Yugantar* was a Bengali revolutionary newspaper, with some association to Subhas Chandra Bose, although not a direct, sole association.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was closely associated with *Kesari*, making this an incorrect pairing. Therefore, only the pairing of *Indian Opinion* and Mahatma Gandhi is definitively correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect or partially correct pairings, emphasizing the importance of precise knowledge of historical publications and their connections to prominent figures. This question tests the candidate’s familiarity with important newspapers and journals of the Indian freedom struggle and their associations with prominent leaders.  The distractors aim to evaluate the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related figures and publications.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Agitation                         Primary Goal
1.  Akali Movement                           :   Removal of corrupt Mahants from Gurudwaras
2.  Moplah Rebellion                          :   Removal of Zamindars in Malabar
3.  Awadh Kisan Praja Sabha Movement       :   Opposition to Rowlatt Act
4.  Non-Cooperation Movement                :   Complete Independence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Akali Movement's primary aim was indeed the reform of Gurudwaras and the removal of corrupt Mahants. The Moplah Rebellion in Malabar was primarily an anti-zamindari movement. The Awadh Kisan Praja Sabha Movement focused on peasant grievances and agrarian issues, not directly on the Rowlatt Act. The Non-Cooperation Movement aimed at non-violent non-cooperation with British rule, ultimately aiming for Swaraj (self-rule), but not explicitly for complete independence at its outset.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific goals of various movements within the Indian independence struggle.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different movements and their objectives, requiring a nuanced understanding of their historical context.  The inclusion of distractors tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between movements with similar goals but different focuses.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Act/Policy                     Key Feature/Impact
1.  Pitt's India Act, 1784              : Established a Board of Control
2.  Charter Act of 1813                 : Ended the Company's monopoly over Indian trade except for tea and China trade
3.  Charter Act of 1833                 :  Declared the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India
4.  Act for Better Government of India, 1858 : Transferred governance from the East India Company to the Crown.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Pitt's India Act of 1784 significantly increased British government control over the East India Company by creating the Board of Control, which oversaw the Company's civil, military, and revenue affairs. The Charter Act of 1813 ended the Company's monopoly over most Indian trade, a crucial step towards a more open market, though exceptions remained for the lucrative tea and China trades. The Charter Act of 1833 centralized the administration in India by making the Governor-General of Bengal the Governor-General of India, effectively establishing a single, supreme authority. Finally, the Act for Better Government of India, 1858, formally transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, marking a significant shift in the nature of colonial rule.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of key legislative milestones in the history of British rule in India, demanding precise knowledge of the specific features of each act.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System in British India        Principal Characteristic
1.  Permanent Settlement                :  Introduced in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Banaras, and parts of Northern Madras
2.  Ryotwari System                     :  Direct revenue collection from individual cultivators
3.  Mahalwari System                   :  Revenue assessment based on the village community as a unit
4.  Hastings' Izaredari System         :  Revenue collection through contractors bidding for the right to collect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe a key characteristic of the respective land revenue systems implemented by the British in India. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal and surrounding areas, granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, who then collected revenue from the peasants. The Ryotwari System, in contrast, involved direct collection of revenue from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries. The Mahalwari System settled revenue with the village community as a unit, offering a different approach to revenue collection.  Hastings' Izaredari system employed contractors who bid for the right to collect revenue, often leading to exploitation. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, failing to encompass the full range of correctly matched pairs. The question demands a comprehensive understanding of the British land revenue systems, their geographical implementation, and their core operational mechanisms, testing factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**3. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Action                            Associated Consequence
1.  Divide and Rule                        :  Increased communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims
2.  Hostility towards educated Indians    :  Suppression of nationalist movements
3.  Alliance with Zamindars and Princes :  Strengthening of conservative forces against reform
4.  Restrictions on the Press             :  Curtailment of nationalist expression through newspapers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a direct consequence of the British policy mentioned. The "Divide and Rule" policy deliberately exacerbated existing religious and caste differences to weaken the unified opposition to British rule, creating deep-seated communal tensions.  Hostility towards educated Indians, who were often at the forefront of nationalist movements, resulted in the suppression of these movements through various means, including imprisonment and censorship.  The British alliance with conservative elements like Zamindars and Princes served to counter the influence of nationalist-minded intellectuals and reformers, effectively hindering social and political reforms.  Restrictions on the Indian press, particularly the Vernacular Press Act, severely limited the ability of nationalists to express their views and organize through newspapers and publications. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, neglecting correctly matched pairs, thus demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of British colonial strategies. This question tests the candidate's analytical skills and their ability to link British policies with their social and political impacts in India.


**4. With reference to the development of education in British India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                     Key Provision/Outcome
1.  Charter Act of 1813             : Allocated funds for the education of Indians
2.  Macaulay's Minute, 1835        : Advocated for English as the medium of instruction in higher education
3.  Wood's Despatch, 1854          : Introduced a comprehensive hierarchical education system
4.  Hunter Commission, 1882-83    : Focused primarily on primary and secondary education reform

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Three out of the four pairs are correctly matched. The Charter Act of 1813, while not a comprehensive education policy, did allocate funds, albeit a small amount, for the promotion of education among Indians.  Macaulay's Minute is famously associated with the push for English as the primary medium of instruction in higher education, reflecting a belief in the superiority of Western learning.  Wood's Despatch of 1854 provided a detailed framework for a multi-tiered education system, from primary schools to universities.  The Hunter Commission of 1882-83 shifted focus to the improvement of primary and secondary education, recognizing the shortcomings of previous policies. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect as they do not account for enough correct pairings. Option (c) is incorrect, as one pair is wrongly matched.  This question tests factual recall of key educational policies and their characteristics and outcomes in British India, highlighting the evolution of educational priorities and approaches over time.  The question also tests the ability to distinguish between accurate and partially accurate statements about historical events.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                   Contribution to Indian Constitutional Development
1.  Annie Besant                          :  Authorship of the Home Rule Bill of 1895
2.  Motilal Nehru                         :  Drafting of the Nehru Report of 1928
3.  B.R. Ambedkar                        :  Chairmanship of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                     :  Proposing the idea of a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Three out of four pairs are correctly matched. While the exact authorship of the Home Rule Bill of 1895 remains debated,  Motilal Nehru played a pivotal role in drafting the Nehru Report (1928), a significant constitutional proposal.  B.R. Ambedkar is undeniably famous for his leadership of the Drafting Committee, which produced the final draft of the Indian Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru consistently advocated for a Constituent Assembly elected by universal adult suffrage. Option (a) is incorrect as it only picks one correct pair, Option (b) is incorrect as it misses one pairing while Option (c) is also incorrect as it misses one pairing. The question tests factual recall, specifically focusing on individuals' significant contributions to the evolution of India's constitutional framework.  It assesses the candidate's knowledge of key historical figures and their roles in the movement for self-governance and constitutional development.  The inclusion of the debated authorship of the Home Rule Bill adds a layer of complexity, demanding critical evaluation beyond simple recall.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on the Indian Nationalist Movement, with a difficulty level of 'difficult'.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Association/Activity
1. Lala Lajpat Rai              :  Abhinava Bharat
2. V.D. Savarkar               :  Deportation following Punjab riots
3. Aurobindo Ghose            :  "To make the administration impossible..." statement
4. Khudiram Bose              :  Bombing attempt on the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal
5.  Chidambaram Pillai        :  Passive resistance in Madras

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghose is correctly linked to the statement advocating passive resistance to make British administration impossible.  Chidambaram Pillai's involvement in passive resistance in Madras is also accurately depicted.  Option (a) is incorrect because Lala Lajpat Rai was not associated with the Abhinava Bharat; that was V.D. Savarkar. Option (b) is incorrect because while Savarkar is correctly linked to the Abhinava Bharat, his deportation was following riots in the Punjab, not a direct association with the Abhinava Bharat itself. Option (d) is incorrect because Khudiram Bose's act was the Muzaffarpur bombing, not an attempt on the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their specific actions within the militant nationalist movement.  It necessitates precise recall and an understanding of the nuances within the movement's strategies.


**2. With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Primary Focus/Activity
1. British India Association          :  Promoting the interests of landlords
2. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha          :   Advocating for widow remarriage
3. East India Association            :  Influencing British public opinion on Indian issues
4. Madras Native Association       :  Agitation for Civil Service reforms
5. Indian Association, Calcutta   :  Promoting secular education exclusively

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The British India Association primarily focused on the interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  The East India Association, established by Dadabhai Naoroji in London, aimed to influence British public opinion on Indian affairs. Option (b) is incorrect because while the Madras Native Association existed, its primary focus was not solely Civil Service reforms; it addressed broader public interests. Option (c) is incorrect because the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, while involved in social reform, did not primarily focus on widow remarriage, and the Indian Association in Calcutta promoted broader political and social reforms, not solely secular education. Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the British India Association and its focus. This question challenges the candidate's understanding of the diverse early nationalist organizations and their specific goals, demanding accurate knowledge of their roles and activities.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                           Prominent Figure/Leader
1. Partition of Bengal                 :  Lord Curzon
2. Morley-Minto Reforms              :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale (primary opposition)
3. Annulment of Partition of Bengal  :  Lord Hardinge
4. Surat Split of Congress             :  Dadabhai Naoroji (primary mediator)
5.  Indian Councils Act of 1892       :  Lord Lansdowne

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Curzon is correctly associated with the Partition of Bengal. Lord Hardinge oversaw the annulment of the partition. Lord Lansdowne was Viceroy during the passage of the Indian Councils Act of 1892. Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs the Morley-Minto Reforms with Gokhale as the primary opposition; while he opposed aspects, it wasn't his central focus.  Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the Surat Split with Dadabhai Naoroji as a primary mediator; he was the president of the Calcutta session but not a key figure in resolving the Surat split. Option (d) is incorrect because it also misrepresents the role of Dadabhai Naoroji in the Surat split.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key events in the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement and their association with specific leaders and viceroys, demanding precise factual recall.



**4. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Publication/Organization         Prominent Figure/Activity
1.  Kesari                          :  V.O. Chidambaram Pillai
2.  Yugantar                       :  Advocated revolutionary terrorism
3.  Swadeshi Steam Navigation Co. :  Bal Gangadhar Tilak
4.  Abhinava Bharat                :  Passive resistance
5.  Bande Mataram                  :  Rabindranath Tagore (composition)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Yugantar newspaper openly advocated revolutionary terrorism. Rabindranath Tagore composed the song Bande Mataram, which became a powerful symbol of the movement. Option (b) is incorrect because the Kesari was associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak, not V.O. Chidambaram Pillai, and the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company was led by Chidambaram Pillai, not Tilak. Option (c) is incorrect for the same reasons, and also because Abhinava Bharat was not primarily focused on passive resistance. Option (d) mismatches the Kesari with Tilak. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Swadeshi Movement, its various facets, and the individuals and publications associated with it, requiring accurate recall of specific details and differentiating between related but distinct figures and activities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Reform/Act            Key Characteristic/Outcome
1. Wood's Despatch (1854)           :  Established separate electorates
2. Hunter Commission (1882-83)     :  Emphasized vernacular education
3. Indian Universities Act (1904)   :  Promoted mass education
4.  Sargent Plan (1944)              :  Advocated for universal literacy within 40 years
5.  Hartog Committee (1929)        :  Focused primarily on higher education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Hunter Commission significantly emphasized vernacular language education in its recommendations. The Sargent Plan aimed for universal literacy in India within a 40-year timeframe. Option (b) is incorrect because Wood's Despatch didn't establish separate electorates (that was a feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms). Option (c) is incorrect because the Indian Universities Act of 1904 did not promote mass education and the Hartog Committee focused primarily on primary education. Option (d) is incorrect because it misrepresents both Wood's Despatch and the Hartog Committee's focus.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of British educational policies in India and their key features, requiring knowledge of specific commissions and acts and their impact on the education system.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the British Raj in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature/Impact
1. Wood's Despatch (1854)                     :   Emphasized the downward filtration theory of education
2. Macaulay's Minute (1835)                   :   Advocated for English as the medium of instruction in higher education
3. Charter Act of 1813                         :   Allocated funds for the establishment of the Calcutta Madrasah
4. Vernacular Press Act (1878)                 :   Promoted freedom of the press in vernacular languages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Macaulay's Minute explicitly advocated for English as the medium of higher education, aiming to create a class of Indians educated in Western thought.  

Option (a) is incorrect because while Wood's Despatch aimed for mass education, it didn't explicitly *emphasize* the downward filtration theory; that was a consequence of the limited resources. Option (c) is incorrect because the Vernacular Press Act aimed to *restrict*, not promote, freedom of the press in vernacular languages. Option (d) is incorrect because the Charter Act of 1813 allocated funds for the promotion of knowledge of modern sciences and not specifically for the Calcutta Madrasah, which was established much earlier.  The Calcutta Madrasah and the Benaras Sanskrit College were established before the Charter Act of 1813, representing early, albeit limited, attempts at education by the British East India Company.


**2. With reference to the British educational policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Act                                 Primary Focus/Recommendation
1. Hunter Commission (1882-83)                 :   Emphasis on higher education and technical training
2. Sadler Commission (1917-19)                 :   Advocated for a 12-year school course and intermediate stage
3. Indian Universities Act of 1904               :   Increased autonomy for universities and reduced government control
4. Hartog Committee (1929)                     :  Highlighted the need for improved quality of primary education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Sadler Commission focused on improving the structure of university education, including recommending a longer school course and an intermediate stage before university. The Hartog Committee extensively analyzed the shortcomings of primary education, advocating for improvements in quality and addressing issues like wastage and stagnation.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Indian Universities Act of 1904 aimed to *increase*, not decrease, government control over universities. Option (c) is incorrect because the Hunter Commission's primary focus was on primary and secondary education, not higher education and technical training. Option (d) is incorrect as the Hartog committee's findings were crucial, and other commissions also played significant roles in shaping education policy.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    British Revenue Policy                       Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement (Bengal)              :   Direct revenue collection from individual cultivators
2. Ryotwari System (Madras)                   :   Revenue fixed as a percentage of gross produce
3. Mahalwari System (North India)              :   Revenue collection through village communities as intermediaries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Ryotwari system in Madras Presidency involved fixing revenue as a percentage of the gross produce of the land, collected directly from individual cultivators. The Mahalwari system in North India utilized village communities as intermediaries in revenue collection.

Option (b) is incorrect as the Permanent Settlement dealt with zamindars, not direct collection from cultivators. Option (c) is incorrect because although the Mahalwari system did involve village communities, the Ryotwari system also had important characteristics. Option (d) is incorrect because, as explained above, the Permanent Settlement did not involve direct revenue collection from individual cultivators.


**4. With reference to the British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Act/Policy                                     Primary Aim/Consequence
1.  Ilbert Bill Controversy (1883)               :   Strengthened racial discrimination
2.  Vernacular Press Act (1878)                 :   Curbed nationalist criticism of the government
3.  Morley-Minto Reforms (1909)                 :   Introduced separate electorates for Muslims

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Vernacular Press Act aimed to suppress criticism of the government in vernacular newspapers. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a significant step in the British policy of divide and rule.

Option (a) is incorrect because the Ilbert Bill aimed to *reduce* racial discrimination by allowing Indian magistrates to try Europeans, although it ultimately failed due to strong European opposition. Option (c) is incorrect because, as explained, both the Vernacular Press Act and the Morley-Minto Reforms had the stated aims. Option (d) is incorrect for the reason stated above about the Ilbert Bill.  The Ilbert Bill controversy actually highlighted the extent of racial discrimination and the British government's unwillingness to fully address it.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                       Association/Contribution
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                              :   Founded the East India Association
2. Surendranath Banerjea                         :   Founded the British India Association
3. Raja Rammohan Roy                            :   Promoted the cause of widow remarriage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji founded the East India Association in London. Raja Rammohan Roy was a strong advocate for widow remarriage and various other social reforms.

Option (b) is incorrect because while Surendranath Banerjea was a prominent nationalist leader, he was associated with the Indian Association, not the British India Association. Option (c) is incorrect because both Dadabhai Naoroji and Raja Rammohan Roy made significant contributions. Option (d) is incorrect due to the error regarding Surendranath Banerjea's association.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Institution                  Founder/Prominent Figure
1. Calcutta Madrasah                       :   Jonathan Duncan
2. Sanskrit College, Benaras              :   Warren Hastings
3. Fort William College                    :   Lord Wellesley
4. Bethune School, Calcutta                :   James Thomson


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Calcutta Madrasah was established by Warren Hastings in 1781, not Jonathan Duncan.  The Sanskrit College at Benaras was founded by Jonathan Duncan in 1791, not Warren Hastings. Fort William College was indeed established by Lord Wellesley in 1800. The Bethune School in Calcutta was founded by J.E.D. Bethune, not James Thomson. James Thomson is associated with the development of a comprehensive scheme of village education in the North-West Provinces. Therefore, only the pairing of Fort William College with Lord Wellesley is accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairings of educational institutions with their founders or prominent figures.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and institutions in the development of education under the British in India.  Understanding the chronology and the key players involved is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Reform/Policy              Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Wood's Despatch (1854)                 :   Emphasis on mass education through vernacular languages
2. Hunter Commission (1882-83)            :   Advocated for compulsory primary education
3. Sadler Commission (1917-19)            :   Recommended a 12-year school course culminating in a three-year degree
4.  Sargent Plan (1944)                    :   Proposed universal literacy within 20 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Wood's Despatch, while aiming for broader education, didn't primarily focus on mass education through vernacular languages at the primary level.  It recommended English for higher studies and vernaculars at the school level. The Hunter Commission emphasized the need for improved primary education but didn't advocate for compulsory primary education. The Sadler Commission did indeed recommend a 12-year school course with an intermediate stage before university. The Sargent Plan aimed for universal literacy within 40 years, not 20.  Therefore, only the pairing of the Sadler Commission with its recommendation of a 12-year school course is entirely accurate.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the key features or recommendations of these educational reforms and policies. The question tests the ability to differentiate between the various educational reforms and their specific characteristics, requiring detailed knowledge of educational history in India during the British Raj and post-independence era.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy related to Indian Press       Key Provision/Impact
1. Censorship of Press Act, 1799         :   Repealed pre-censorship
2. Licensing Regulations, 1823            :   Targeted primarily Indian-language newspapers
3. Press Act of 1835 (Metcalfe Act)      :   Imposed strict licensing restrictions
4. Vernacular Press Act, 1878            :   Discriminated between English and vernacular press


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Censorship of Press Act, 1799, imposed pre-censorship, not repealed it.  The Licensing Regulations of 1823 did indeed primarily target Indian-language newspapers. The Press Act of 1835 (Metcalfe Act) liberalized the press, not imposing strict licensing restrictions. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 clearly discriminated between the English and vernacular press.  Therefore, only the pairings of the Licensing Regulations of 1823 and the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 with their respective key provisions are entirely correct.  The question assesses the understanding of the evolution of press regulations in India under British rule, highlighting the discriminatory nature of certain acts and their impact on the freedom of the press.  The ability to recall specific provisions and their consequences is crucial for a correct response.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Organization            Key Goal/Activity
1. British India Association               :   Organized armed uprisings
2. East India Association, London        :   Advocated for Indian welfare in Britain
3. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                 :   Published a quarterly journal on economic issues
4. Indian Association, Calcutta           :   Focused solely on landlord interests


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The British India Association did not organize armed uprisings; its focus was on constitutional methods.  The East India Association, London, was indeed instrumental in advocating for Indian welfare in Britain. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha did publish a quarterly journal that served as an intellectual guide on economic matters. The Indian Association, Calcutta, was involved in broader public interests beyond landlord concerns. Only the pairings of the East India Association and the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha with their respective goals and activities are accurate. The question tests the knowledge of early nationalist organizations in India and their primary aims.  Distinguishing between their approaches and activities is crucial for accurate matching.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Religious Reform Movement/Figure       Key Characteristic/Contribution
1. Rammohun Roy                           :   Advocated for the abolition of Sati
2. Sayyid Ahmad Khan                     :   Focused solely on religious reform, ignoring social issues
3.  Arya Samaj                             :   Opposed the introduction of modern education
4.  Brahmo Samaj                           :   Rejected the Vedas as authoritative scripture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rammohun Roy was a strong advocate for the abolition of Sati and other social reforms. Sayyid Ahmad Khan, while advocating for education and social reform, did not ignore social issues.  The Arya Samaj promoted modern education, and the Brahmo Samaj accepted the Vedas, though they emphasized reason and interpretation. Only Rammohun Roy's association with the abolition of Sati is a completely accurate pairing.  The question assesses knowledge of 19th-century religious reform movements in India, requiring an understanding of their diverse goals and approaches.  The distractors highlight potential misconceptions about the movements and their leaders.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of British rule in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                     Region Primarily Implemented
1. Ryotwari System                   :   Bengal and Bihar
2. Mahalwari System                  :   Madras Presidency and Bombay Presidency (parts)
3. Permanent Settlement             :   North-Western Provinces, Central Provinces, and Punjab

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ryotwari system was primarily implemented in Madras Presidency and parts of Bombay Presidency, not Bengal and Bihar.  The Mahalwari system was indeed implemented in parts of the North-Western Provinces, Central Provinces, and Punjab. The Permanent Settlement was introduced in Bengal and Bihar, and later extended to some parts of Orissa, Banaras, and northern Madras. Option (b) is thus the only correct match. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the geographical implementation of these revenue systems.  Understanding the nuances of land revenue systems under the British Raj is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of colonial administration and its impact on Indian agrarian society.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to distinguish between the regions where each system was predominantly implemented.


**2. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                 Objective
1. Divide and Rule                       :   Promote industrial growth in India
2. Hostility towards educated Indians   :   Counter the rise of nationalism
3. Alliance with Zamindars and landlords :   Strengthen peasant movements

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The British "Divide and Rule" policy aimed to prevent the unification of Indian society against colonial rule, not to promote industrial growth.  Their hostility towards educated Indians stemmed from the perception that these individuals were the primary drivers of the nationalist movement.  The British often allied with Zamindars and landlords to counter the influence of nationalist-minded intelligentsia, not to strengthen peasant movements. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect due to a misinterpretation of the aims and consequences of British administrative policies.  This question tests the candidate’s understanding of the core strategies employed by the British to maintain their control over India, highlighting the manipulative nature of their governance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                        Principal Provision
1. The Indian Factory Act, 1881             :   Fixed maximum working hours for men at 11 hours per day
2. The Indian Factory Act, 1891             :   Increased the minimum age for child labour to 9 years
3. Vernacular Press Act, 1878                :   Lifted restrictions on the Indian press

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Factory Act of 1881 did not regulate working hours for men; it primarily focused on child labor. The 1891 Act did indeed raise the minimum age for child labor and introduced other regulations. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed restrictions, not lifting them. Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question assesses factual knowledge of key legislative acts during British rule and their impact on workers' rights and freedom of the press. The distractors test the candidate's ability to recall specific details of these acts.


**4. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                     Key Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement              :   Direct revenue collection from individual cultivators
2. Ryotwari System                     :   Revenue fixed as a percentage of gross produce
3. Mahalwari System                    :   Revenue collection through village communities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement involved a fixed revenue demand from Zamindars, not direct collection from cultivators. The Ryotwari system did indeed involve fixing revenue as a percentage of the gross produce. The Mahalwari system involved collecting revenue through village communities.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different revenue systems and their features. The distractors highlight the subtle differences between these systems, requiring detailed knowledge for accurate matching.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                   Association/Movement
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                   :   East India Association
3.  Surendranath Banerjea                 :   Indian Association


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was associated with the East India Association, not the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha (which was founded by Justice Ranade). Gopal Krishna Gokhale was not directly associated with the East India Association, though he was a prominent Congress leader. Surendranath Banerjea was a key figure in the founding of the Indian Association. Only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of prominent personalities of the early nationalist movement and their affiliations.  The distractors involve closely related but incorrect associations, demanding precise knowledge for a correct answer.


**6. With reference to the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                     Year
1. Partition of Bengal           :   1911
2. Morley-Minto Reforms         :   1909
3.  Rowlatt Act                   :   1919


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The partition of Bengal took place in 1905, not 1911 (it was annulled in 1911). The Morley-Minto Reforms were introduced in 1909. The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919.  Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the chronological understanding of significant events in the Indian nationalist movement.  The incorrect dates act as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge of historical timelines.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Movement           Prominent Leader
1. Khilafat Movement              :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2. Non-Cooperation Movement    :   Mahatma Gandhi
3.  Swadeshi Movement             :   Bal Gangadhar Tilak


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent leader of the moderate nationalist movement, not the Khilafat Movement. Mahatma Gandhi played a central role in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a key figure in the Swadeshi Movement.  Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests the understanding of the leadership of various significant movements in the Indian national movement.  The incorrect pairings introduce plausible but incorrect associations, making the question more challenging.


**8. With reference to the British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Idea/Concept                    British Response
1.  Rationalism                     :   Complete rejection and suppression
2.  Humanism                      :   Selective adoption and adaptation
3.  Doctrine of Progress             :   Partial acceptance with colonial limitations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the British did not entirely reject rationalism, their response was often selective and aimed at serving their colonial interests.  Humanism was partially adopted to justify certain reforms while simultaneously maintaining colonial control.  The Doctrine of Progress was partially accepted but was often limited by the needs of colonial exploitation.  Pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the complex and often contradictory nature of British responses to these philosophical concepts. This question tests the nuanced understanding of British policies and their interaction with evolving intellectual currents in India.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate’s ability to assess the complex interplay of ideologies.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects, adhering to all specified criteria.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Year of Establishment
1. Landholders’ Society                  :   1843
2. Bengal British Indian Society         :   1837
3. British India Association             :   1852
4. Madras Native Association             :   1885

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Landholders’ Society was established in 1837, not 1843 as stated in option 1.  The Bengal British Indian Society was indeed founded in 1843. The British India Association, formed by the merger of the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, was established in 1851. Option 3 correctly identifies the year of establishment as 1852, making it a plausible distractor. The Madras Native Association was established in 1852, not 1885 as stated in option 4. The Bombay Association was also established in 1852.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail to avoid the strategically placed incorrect dates.  The inclusion of closely related, yet incorrect, dates makes this a difficult question.


**2. With reference to the pre-independence era in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Reform                                  Primary Objective
1. Indian Councils Act of 1892             :   Introduction of communal representation
2. Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909           :   Expansion of Legislative Councils with limited Indian representation
3. Government of India Act of 1935          :   Establishment of provincial autonomy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the Legislative Councils, but it did not introduce communal representation. That feature was a key element of the Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909.  The Minto-Morley Reforms did indeed aim to expand the Legislative Councils and increase Indian representation, albeit limited.  The Government of India Act of 1935 did introduce provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system. Option 1 is designed as a distractor, playing on the association of later acts with communal representation. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because only option 2 and 3 are correct. The question tests factual knowledge of significant legislative acts and their core provisions.  The incorrect pairing in option 1 provides a challenging distractor.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Association                Primary Goal
1. East India Association, London          :   Promoting Indian welfare and influencing British public opinion
2. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                 :   Criticism of administrative and legislative measures
3. Indian Association of Calcutta           :   Creating a strong public opinion and unifying Indians on a common political program

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) All three

**Explanation:**

The East India Association, founded by Dadabhai Naoroji, aimed to advocate for Indian interests within Britain. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, led by figures like Justice Ranade, focused on critiquing British policies. The Indian Association of Calcutta, spearheaded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, actively worked towards fostering national unity and public opinion. All three organizations had distinct yet interconnected goals within the broader context of the Indian nationalist movement.  This question assesses the understanding of the diverse approaches and objectives of pre-independence Indian nationalist organizations.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a difficult question demanding complete knowledge.


**4. With reference to pre-independence India, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                 Significant Contribution/Association
1. A. O. Hume                      :   Founded the Indian National Congress
2. Surendranath Banerjea            :   Led the Indian Association of Calcutta
3. Dadabhai Naoroji                  :   Authored the "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

A. O. Hume played a pivotal role in the founding of the Indian National Congress. Surendranath Banerjea was a key leader of the Indian Association of Calcutta, a significant precursor to the Congress. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist leader, is indeed associated with the seminal work, "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," which provided a powerful critique of British economic policies. All three pairs accurately reflect the contributions and associations of these important figures in the Indian freedom struggle. This question tests factual recall of key historical figures and their roles in the Indian National Movement. The inclusion of all correct pairs aims to test comprehensive knowledge.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                          Region of Implementation
1. Permanent Settlement                   :   Bombay Presidency
2. Ryotwari System                       :   Bengal Presidency
3. Mahalwari System                       :   North-Western Provinces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa, not the Bombay Presidency.  The Ryotwari System was largely implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies. The Mahalwari System was indeed implemented in North-Western Provinces.  Options 1 and 2 are designed as distractors, testing knowledge of the geographical reach of different land revenue systems.  The question assesses the understanding of the historical context of land revenue systems in British India and their regional variations.  The strategically incorrect pairings in options 1 and 2 make this a challenging question.


**6. With reference to the growth of communalism in pre-independence India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Group                       Ideological Stance
1. Muslim League                           :   Advocated for a separate Muslim state (Pakistan)
2. Hindu Mahasabha                         :   Championed Hindu interests and often opposed Congress policies
3. All India States' Peoples' Conference:   Focused on achieving democratic rights within princely states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, ultimately advocated for the creation of Pakistan. The Hindu Mahasabha represented Hindu communal interests and often clashed with the Congress. The All India States' Peoples' Conference worked to promote democratic reforms and self-governance within the princely states. All three pairs correctly identify the primary ideological positions of these groups. The question tests understanding of the complex dynamics of communal politics in pre-independence India. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a difficult question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pre-Congress Nationalist Organization       Location/Founder
1. British India Association                   :   Madras
2. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                    :   Dadabhai Naoroji
3. Madras Mahajan Sabha                     :   Bombay

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The British India Association was formed by a merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily based in Bengal.  Option 1 is incorrect because it associates the organization with Madras.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded in Poona (Pune) by Justice Ranade and others, not Dadabhai Naoroji. Option 2 is incorrect. The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in Madras, not Bombay. Option 3 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji founded the East India Association in London.  Option 4 is correct. The Indian Association of Calcutta was founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose. Option 5 is correct. Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of pre-Congress nationalist organizations and their founders/locations, highlighting the complexities of the early nationalist movement and requiring precise knowledge of these historical details.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the geographical spread and leadership of these organizations.


**2. With reference to the pre-independence era in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                      Primary Focus
1. Bombay Presidency Association     :   Landlord interests
2. Landholders’ Society              :   Promotion of general public interests
3. Bengal British Indian Society      :   Administrative reforms
4. Madras Native Association         :   Reform of administration
5. Scientific Society                 :   Class interests of landlords


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bombay Presidency Association primarily focused on administrative reforms and associating Indians with the administration. Option 1 is incorrect. The Landholders’ Society was specifically established to promote the class interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. Option 2 is incorrect. The Bengal British Indian Society aimed to protect and promote general public interests. Option 3 is correct. The Madras Native Association aimed at the reform of administration. Option 4 is correct. The Scientific Society founded by Sayyid Ahmad Khan did not primarily focus on class interests of landlords. Option 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the diverse aims and objectives of various pre-Congress nationalist organizations, demanding a nuanced comprehension of their historical context and activities. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the goals of these organizations, requiring precise knowledge of their specific focuses.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Leader              Association/Organization
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                :   Bombay Presidency Association
2. Surendranath Banerjea          :   Indian Association
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale           :   East India Association
4.  W.C. Bonnerjee                  :   Poona Sarvajanik Sabha

Surendranath Banerjea was a key figure in the Indian Association of Calcutta. Option 2 is correct. A.O. Hume played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress. Option 5 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji was associated with the East India Association, not the Bombay Presidency Association. Option 1 is incorrect.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was not associated with the East India Association; Dadabhai Naoroji was. Option 3 is incorrect. W.C. Bonnerjee was the first president of the Indian National Congress, not associated with the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha. Option 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent nationalist leaders and their affiliations with various organizations, requiring specific recall of historical details and the ability to distinguish between closely related figures and organizations. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to accurately associate individuals with their respective organizations.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early years, consider the following pairs:**

    Year                               Event
1. 1883                               :   First session of the Indian National Congress
2. 1885                               :   All-India National Conference in Calcutta

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Association was founded in July 1876. Option 3 is correct. The East India Association was established in London in 1866 by Dadabhai Naoroji. Option 4 is correct. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in 1885, not 1883. Option 1 is incorrect. The All-India National Conference took place in 1883, not 1885. Option 2 is incorrect. The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in 1881. Option 5 is correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall key events in the early years of the Indian National Congress and related organizations, testing their chronological understanding of the development of the Indian nationalist movement. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect dates serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the timeline.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                  Significant Contribution
1. A.O. Hume                         :   Advocated for Dominion Status
2. Lord Irwin                         :   Signed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                  :   Presided over the Lahore Congress
4. Mahatma Gandhi                   :   Introduced the concept of Purna Swaraj
5. Ramsay MacDonald                 :   Announced the Communal Award


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Irwin, as Viceroy, signed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in 1931. Option 2 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru presided over the Lahore Congress session in 1929. Option 3 is correct. Ramsay MacDonald, as British Prime Minister, announced the Communal Award in 1932. Option 5 is correct. A.O. Hume was instrumental in founding the Indian National Congress but is not primarily known for advocating Dominion Status. Option 1 is incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi championed the cause of Purna Swaraj (complete independence), but did not introduce the concept itself; the concept evolved gradually within the nationalist movement. Option 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key political figures and their significant contributions during a crucial period of the Indian independence movement. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between the roles and actions of these prominent figures, demanding precise knowledge of their individual contributions.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on British policies in India, aiming for a high difficulty level and incorporating plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Act/Policy                     Primary Focus
1.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878         :  Promoting vernacular language newspapers
2.  Indian Factory Act, 1881           :  Regulating working conditions in tea plantations
3.  Ryotwari System                     :  Revenue collection through village headmen
4.  Permanent Settlement               :  Granting proprietary rights to ryots


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to curb the influence of the Indian-language press, which was increasingly critical of British rule.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched as its primary focus was indeed to control the vernacular press, not promote it.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, granted proprietary rights to zamindars, not ryots (individual cultivators). Ryots were tenants under the zamindars. Thus, pair 4 is also correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Indian Factory Act of 1881 primarily addressed child labor in factories, not working conditions in tea plantations.  The exploitation of labor in plantations continued unchecked for a significant period.  Pair 3 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots), not through village headmen.  Village headmen might have played a role in the process, but they weren't the primary collectors. The Mahalwari system, on the other hand, did involve village communities in revenue collection.


**2. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                     Intended Outcome
1.  Divide and Rule                               :  Promote unified national identity among Indians
2.  College of Fort William                       :  Train Indian civil servants in English administration
3.  Appointment of Indian ICS officers (post-1857) :  Enhance Indian participation in high administrative posts
4.  Restoration of Talukdars' lands (post-1857)   :  Strengthen the British alliance with conservative elements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The British policy of "Divide and Rule" aimed to exploit existing social and religious divisions to weaken the nationalist movement and prevent a unified Indian resistance. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The College of Fort William, established by Lord Wellesley, was intended to train British civil servants, not Indian ones, in Indian languages and customs to better manage the administration.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched. The British initially completely excluded Indians from higher administrative posts in the Indian Civil Service (ICS) and only gradually increased Indian representation in lower and middle ranks, primarily to reduce costs and not to enhance meaningful Indian participation in governance. Pair 3 is thus incorrect. The restoration of Talukdars' lands after the 1857 revolt was a deliberate strategy to strengthen the British alliance with conservative landowners and counteract the influence of nationalist leaders.  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                        Region of Implementation
1.  Permanent Settlement                  :  Bombay Presidency
2.  Ryotwari System                       :  Bengal Presidency
3.  Mahalwari System                     :  North-Western Provinces
4.  Izaredari System                      :  Madras Presidency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa.  The Ryotwari system was implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies. The Mahalwari system was implemented in the North-Western Provinces, Punjab, and parts of Central India. The Izaredari system, a temporary system, was implemented in Bengal before the Permanent Settlement.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly pair the revenue systems with their regions of implementation.


**4. With reference to British educational policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Policy                 Key Recommendation/Focus
1.  Hunter Commission                 :  Emphasis on vocational education at the secondary level
2.  Wood's Despatch                   :  Rejection of the 'downward filtration theory'
3.  Macaulay's Minute                 :  Promotion of vernacular languages as the primary medium of instruction
4.  Sargent Plan                       :  Universalization of primary education within 40 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Hunter Commission, appointed in 1882, did indeed recommend a greater emphasis on vocational education at the secondary level.  Wood's Despatch (1854) advocated for a more active role of the government in primary education, effectively challenging the 'downward filtration theory' which focused primarily on higher education. The Sargent Plan (1944) aimed for universalization of primary education within 40 years.  However, Macaulay's Minute (1835) advocated for English as the medium of instruction for higher education, not vernacular languages.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader                 Key Advocacy
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                     :  Advocacy for complete independence
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                :  Introduction of free and compulsory primary education
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                   :  Emphasis on Swadeshi and Swaraj
4.  Ferozeshah Mehta                     :  Support for the partition of Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent advocate for social reforms and educational advancements, including free and compulsory primary education.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak championed the Swadeshi movement and the concept of Swaraj (self-rule). Dadabhai Naoroji, while a staunch critic of British rule, did not advocate for complete independence in the early phases of the nationalist movement. His primary focus was on gradual reforms within the existing system. Ferozeshah Mehta was a moderate nationalist and did not support the partition of Bengal. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Event                               Year
1. Creation of the province of Assam           :   1874
2. Separation of eleven Assam districts from Bengal:   1911
3. Introduction of the Vernacular Press Act     :   1882
4. First Factory Act passed in India             :   1875

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The province of Assam was created in 1911, not 1874.  In 1874, eleven districts comprising Assam were separated from Bengal and established as a separate administration under a Chief Commissioner. This is a crucial distinction often missed. Option (1) is therefore incorrect. Option (2) correctly identifies the year of Assam's provincial status. The Vernacular Press Act was introduced in 1878, not 1882, and was repealed in 1882. Thus, option (3) is incorrect. The first Indian Factory Act was passed in 1881, not 1875, making option (4) incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Understanding the nuances of historical events and their timelines is crucial for UPSC preparation.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related events and accurately recall dates.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Land Revenue System                     Prominent Administrator
1. Ryotwari Settlement                     :   Lord Cornwallis
2. Mahalwari Settlement                    :   Holt Mackenzie
3. Permanent Settlement                    :   Thomas Munro
4. Izaredari System (Farming System)      :   Warren Hastings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement was primarily associated with Lord Cornwallis, not Thomas Munro. Thomas Munro is known for his role in developing the Ryotwari system.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Holt Mackenzie played a key role in the development of the Mahalwari system, making pair 2 correct.  Warren Hastings implemented the Izaredari system, making pair 4 correct. The Ryotwari system is associated with Thomas Munro and the other administrators in the Madras Presidency, not Lord Cornwallis, making pair 1 incorrect. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various land revenue systems implemented by the British in India and their respective administrators.  The distractors include prominent figures associated with land revenue, requiring a precise understanding of each system’s architect.  The correct answer necessitates detailed knowledge of administrative history.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                        Year
1.  Rowlatt Act                             : 1918
2.  Government of India Act, 1919          : 1921
3.  Vernacular Press Act                   : 1881
4.  Indian Factory Act, 1881               : 1878


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, not 1918, making pair 1 incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1919, was enacted in 1919, not 1921, rendering pair 2 incorrect. The Vernacular Press Act was enacted in 1878, not 1881, and the first Factory Act was passed in 1881, not 1878.  Pairs 3 and 4 are therefore incorrect. Only the Rowlatt Act is correctly matched with its year of enactment, demonstrating the candidate's precise knowledge of significant legislation.  The distractors are carefully selected to include similar acts and legislation, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between them and accurately recall the year of enactment.  This question assesses factual recall and requires precise knowledge of Indian history.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Action                                 Primary Aim
1. Divide and Rule                              :  Promote Hindu-Muslim unity
2.  Support for Zamindars                      :  Counter nationalist intelligentsia
3.  Restrictions on the Press                   :  Encourage free expression
4.  Restoration of Awadh Taluqdars' lands      :  Punish disloyalty during 1857


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The British "Divide and Rule" policy aimed to prevent a united front against their rule, not to promote Hindu-Muslim unity.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Supporting the Zamindars was a deliberate strategy to create a counterweight against the nationalist movement, making pair 2 correct.  Restricting the press was intended to stifle dissent and criticism, not to encourage free expression; thus, pair 3 is incorrect. The restoration of Awadh Taluqdars' lands was intended to appease them and secure their support, not to punish disloyalty;  hence, pair 4 is incorrect. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of British colonial policies and their underlying motives. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to critically evaluate the aims of specific policies.  The correct option requires a nuanced understanding of British imperial strategies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Viceroy                  Significant Action/Policy
1. Lord Cornwallis                            :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System
2. Lord Dalhousie                             :   Doctrine of Lapse
3. Lord Curzon                                :   Partition of Bengal
4. Lord Lytton                                 :   Implementation of the Permanent Settlement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lord Cornwallis is associated with the Permanent Settlement, not the Ryotwari System, making pair 1 incorrect. Lord Dalhousie implemented the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy of annexation, making pair 2 correct. Lord Curzon is known for the Partition of Bengal, making pair 3 correct.  Lord Lytton is not directly associated with the implementation of the Permanent Settlement; that was primarily associated with Lord Cornwallis, making pair 4 incorrect. This question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of specific actions and policies undertaken by various British Governors-General and Viceroys.  The distractors involve other significant figures and policies, requiring detailed knowledge of the period.  The correct answer necessitates a strong grasp of British Indian history and the actions of key administrative figures.



**1. With reference to the early phases of British educational policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Act                                  Prominent Feature/Person
1.  Calcutta University, 1857                  :   Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, early graduate
2.  English Education Act of 1835              :   Proposed by Lord Macaulay
3.  Wood's Despatch of 1854                   :   Advocated for secular education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was indeed one of the first graduates of Calcutta University when it was established in 1857, marking a significant milestone in the Indian education system. The English Education Act of 1835 was a pivotal moment, largely shaped by Lord Macaulay's influential minute, advocating for English as the medium of instruction.  Wood's Despatch of 1854, often considered the "Magna Carta" of English education in India, strongly emphasized the importance of secular education, aiming to create a system free from religious bias.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The comprehensive nature of option (d) reflects the interconnectedness of these historical events in the development of education during British rule in India.  Understanding these key figures and policies is crucial for comprehending the complexities of India's educational landscape under colonial rule and its lasting impact.


**2. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian education, consider the following pairs:**

   Year/Event                                    Characteristic
1.  1844                                         :   English proficiency made mandatory for government jobs
2.  Post-1857                                     :   Emphasis shifted towards vocational training
3.  Early 19th Century                             :   Traditional education focused on literature and philosophy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of the historical trajectory of education under British rule. The year 1844 marked a turning point when proficiency in English became a prerequisite for government employment, significantly altering the demand for and direction of education.  Post-1857, although the initial focus was on Western education, the need to train Indians for specific roles within the colonial administration gradually led to a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training. Finally, in the early 19th century, traditional Indian education systems indeed primarily focused on the humanities – literature, law, religion, philosophy, and logic – with a notable absence of modern sciences and technology. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to capture the full picture of the evolution of British educational policies in India, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the topic.


**3. With reference to the British educational policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Commission                                  Key Feature/Outcome
1.  Macaulay's Minute (1835)                     :   Advocated for vernacular education as the primary medium
2.  Wood's Despatch (1854)                         :   Established universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras
3.  Hunter Commission (1882-83)                   :   Emphasized the need for improved primary education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Wood's Despatch of 1854 was instrumental in establishing universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, formalizing higher education within the British Indian system.  The Hunter Commission's findings highlighted the significant shortcomings in primary education and advocated for its improvement. Macaulay's Minute of 1835, however, championed English education and actually opposed the use of vernacular languages as the primary medium of instruction.  This makes statement 1 incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete and inaccurate representations of the historical facts surrounding British educational policy in India. A thorough understanding of these policies requires distinguishing between the different phases and their contrasting approaches.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to the evolution of education in 19th and 20th century India:**

   Commission/Report                              Recommendation
1.  Raleigh Commission                            :   Introduction of compulsory primary education
2.  Sadler Commission (Calcutta University)    :   Twelve-year school course and intermediate stage
3.  Hartog Committee                             :   Improved quality of primary education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs related to the Sadler and Hartog Commissions are correctly matched.  The Sadler Commission indeed recommended a twelve-year school course, including an intermediate stage before university, to improve the quality and prepare students better for higher education. The Hartog Committee, concerned with the widespread deficiencies in primary education, advocated for improving its quality, not introducing compulsory education at that stage. The Raleigh Commission focused on university reform, and didn't directly address compulsory primary education. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of at least one mismatched pair, showcasing the need for precise knowledge of the specific recommendations of various educational commissions in India during the British Raj.


**5.  With reference to British land revenue systems in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                       Region of Primary Implementation
1.  Permanent Settlement                  :   Madras Presidency
2.  Ryotwari System                       :   Bengal Presidency
3.  Mahalwari System                     :   North-Western Provinces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Mahalwari system was indeed primarily implemented in the North-Western Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa, not the Madras Presidency. The Ryotwari system, meanwhile, was largely introduced in Madras and Bombay Presidencies.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly link at least one revenue system with its region of implementation, highlighting the importance of understanding the geographical distribution of these distinct land revenue systems under British rule in India.  The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors for those lacking precise knowledge of this crucial aspect of British colonial administration.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Administrative Reform        Prominent Figure
1.  Introduction of the Ryotwari System     :   Lord Cornwallis
2.  Reorganisation of the Indian Army after 1858 :   Lord Dalhousie
3.  Establishment of the Fort William College  :   Lord Wellesley
4.  Implementation of the Mahalwari System   :   Holt Mackenzie


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ryotwari system, a direct revenue collection system from individual cultivators, was primarily associated with Thomas Munro, not Lord Cornwallis.  Cornwallis is known for the Permanent Settlement. Option 1 is thus incorrect.  Lord Dalhousie's administration saw significant changes in the army, but the major reorganisation following the 1857 revolt involved multiple figures and wasn't solely attributed to him. Option 2 is therefore also incorrect. Lord Wellesley established the Fort William College in Calcutta for training civil servants in 1800. This is a correct pairing. Holt Mackenzie played a crucial role in recommending and formalizing the Mahalwari system in parts of Northern India.  This is also a correct pairing. Therefore, options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer. The other options incorrectly attribute key reforms to the wrong individuals, demonstrating a need for precise knowledge of administrative history.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                     Chief Characteristic
1.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878                  :   Increased freedom of the Indian press
2.  Indian Factory Act, 1881                     :   Regulated working hours for women
3.  Government of India Act, 1919               :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4.  Pitt's India Act, 1784                        :   Established the Board of Control


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed restrictions, not increased freedom, on the Indian language press.  Option 1 is incorrect. The Indian Factory Act of 1881 primarily focused on child labor; regulations on women's working hours came later. Option 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces, which is correct.  The Pitt's India Act of 1784 established the Board of Control to oversee the East India Company's affairs, also correct. Therefore, options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include pairings that misrepresent the aims and effects of significant acts and policies, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of British India's legislative history to avoid misinterpretations.



**3. With reference to the British administrative policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                  Consequence
1.  Divide and Rule                         :   Strengthened national unity
2.  Hostility towards educated Indians     :   Suppressed nationalist movements
3.  Alliance with Zamindars and Landlords :   Improved peasant welfare
4.  Neglect of social services              :   Increased rural poverty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "Divide and Rule" policy actively worked against national unity, fostering communal and regional divisions.  Option 1 is incorrect.  British hostility towards educated Indians, who were often at the forefront of nationalist movements, directly led to the suppression of such movements. Option 2 is correct.  The British alliance with Zamindars and Landlords often came at the expense of peasant welfare, exacerbating existing inequalities. Option 3 is incorrect. The neglect of social services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure contributed significantly to increased rural poverty and lack of development. Option 4 is correct. Therefore only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Other options incorrectly link policies with their opposite consequences or present a distorted picture of historical realities, emphasizing the need for critical analysis of historical narratives.


**4. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                                     Key Feature
1.  Cornwallis' reforms                          :   Introduction of competitive examinations
2.  Charter Act of 1853                          :   Abolition of Company patronage
3.  Indian Civil Service Act of 1861             :   Simultaneous examinations in India and Britain
4.  Lee Commission recommendations            :   50:50 parity between Europeans and Indians in ICS recruitment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Cornwallis' reforms focused on improving the efficiency and integrity of the ICS through salary increases and stricter rules, not the introduction of competitive examinations. That came later. Option 1 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1853 did abolish the East India Company's patronage system for ICS recruitment, paving the way for a more meritocratic system based on competitive examinations. This is a correct pairing. The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did not introduce simultaneous examinations in India and Britain; the examinations remained primarily in England. Option 3 is incorrect. The Lee Commission recommended steps towards increasing Indian representation in the ICS, including aiming for 50:50 parity, but this was a goal, not an immediate reality. This is a correct pairing. Therefore, options 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options present an inaccurate timeline or misinterpret the key features of important events in the history of the ICS, emphasizing the need for precise factual knowledge to navigate complex historical processes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                                    Characteristic Feature
1.  Permanent Settlement                         :   Direct revenue collection from ryots
2.  Ryotwari System                              :   Assessment based on village as a unit
3.  Mahalwari System                             :   Zamindars granted proprietary rights
4.  Hastings' Izaredari System                   :   Revenue farmed out to contractors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement involved granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, not direct revenue collection from ryots. This was a feature of the Ryotwari system. Option 1 is incorrect.  The Ryotwari system involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots), not assessment based on the village as a unit. That was a characteristic of the Mahalwari system. Option 2 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, while involving villages, didn't grant proprietary rights to Zamindars; it was the Permanent Settlement that did. Option 3 is incorrect. Hastings' Izaredari system did involve farming out the revenue collection to contractors, making this a correct pairing.  Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.  The other options demonstrate the need for precise knowledge of the different land revenue systems introduced by the British and their specific features to avoid common misconceptions.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Journal                                     Association with Revolutionary Activities
1. Sandhya                                  :   Associated with revolutionary activities
2. Yugantar                                 :   Associated with revolutionary activities
3. Gadar                                    :   Associated with revolutionary activities
4. Young India                               :   Not associated with revolutionary activities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Sandhya, Yugantar, and Gadar were journals actively involved in revolutionary activities during the Indian freedom struggle.  Sandhya, a Bengali journal, played a significant role in disseminating revolutionary ideas and mobilizing support for the cause. Yugantar, another prominent Bengali journal, was known for its radical stance and its contribution to the revolutionary movement. Gadar, published in Urdu and Gurmukhi, was a key publication of the Ghadar Party, an organization dedicated to overthrowing British rule in India.  In contrast, Young India, edited by Mahatma Gandhi, advocated for non-violent resistance and was not directly involved in revolutionary activities.  Option (a) accurately reflects the association of Sandhya, Yugantar, and Gadar with revolutionary movements, while correctly identifying Young India's distinct approach. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the involvement of the journals or include Young India, which is factually mismatched.  The question assesses factual recall and requires careful analysis of the roles played by different publications in the Indian freedom struggle.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Prominent Feature
1. Regulating Act of 1773                   :   Established a Supreme Court at Calcutta
2. Amending Act of 1781                     :   Exempted revenue matters from Supreme Court jurisdiction
3. Pitt’s India Act of 1784                 :   Created the Board of Control
4. Charter Act of 1833                      :   Made the Governor-General of Bengal the Governor-General of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a Supreme Court in Calcutta as a significant step towards establishing a centralized judicial system. The Amending Act of 1781 clarified the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, exempting revenue matters from its purview to avoid conflicts with the existing revenue administration.  Pitt's India Act of 1784 created the Board of Control in Britain to oversee the East India Company's affairs, marking a crucial shift towards greater government control. The Charter Act of 1833 abolished the Company's monopoly over trade (except for tea and China trade) and made the Governor-General of Bengal the Governor-General of India, centralizing administrative power. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of significant legislative acts and their key provisions during the British rule in India.  Understanding the chronology and the evolution of British administrative and judicial structures is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Charter Act                               Feature
1. Charter Act of 1793                     :   Renewed the Company’s commercial privileges for twenty years
2. Charter Act of 1813                     :   Ended the Company’s monopoly over trade in India (except China and tea)
3. Charter Act of 1853                     :   Introduced competitive examinations for the Indian Civil Service

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Charter Act of 1793 extended the East India Company's trading monopoly for another 20 years, reflecting the continued importance of trade for the British in India.  The Charter Act of 1813 marked a significant shift by ending the Company's monopoly over most of the Indian trade, though retaining control over the lucrative tea and China trade. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced a major reform in the recruitment process for the Indian Civil Service, replacing patronage with open competitive examinations, although it still had discriminatory practices against Indians.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the impact of the Charter Acts on British commercial policies and the civil service in India.  It highlights the gradual shift from a purely trade-focused approach to a more administrative and centralized control.


**4. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Police System, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Official              Action related to Police Reform
1. Lord Cornwallis                         :   Established a regular police force based on the Thana system
2. Lord Mayo                               :   Appointed a Superintendent of Police for each division, supported by spies
3. Lord Bentinck                           :   Abolished the office of Superintendent of Police and made the Collector/Magistrate head of police in his jurisdiction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect key developments in the evolution of the Indian Police system. Lord Cornwallis significantly reformed the police by establishing a regular force based on the existing Thana system, aiming for better organization and control. Lord Mayo's reforms included appointing Superintendents of Police for each division, a step towards improving regional administration, although the use of spies proved controversial. Lord Bentinck's changes, aimed at administrative efficiency, placed the Collector/Magistrate as the head of the police in their jurisdiction, although this often led to an overburdened and inefficient system. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to capture the full range of significant police reforms initiated by these individuals. The question tests factual recall and requires understanding of the administrative context of police reforms during the British Raj. It emphasizes the gradual evolution of the police structure and its role in maintaining British control in India.


**5. With reference to the British Revenue Policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                       Key Feature
1. Permanent Settlement                  :   Fixed revenue demand from Zamindars
2. Ryotwari System                        :   Revenue collected directly from individual cultivators
3. Mahalwari System                       :   Revenue assessed collectively from village communities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately describe the key features of the major British revenue systems in India. The Permanent Settlement involved a fixed revenue demand levied on Zamindars, creating a system of land ownership with inherent challenges. The Ryotwari System, in contrast, focused on direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, aiming for greater efficiency, but often leading to exploitation. The Mahalwari System adopted a collective approach, assessing revenue from village communities, attempting to balance individual and community interests, but also prone to inaccuracies and exploitation.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more accurately described features of these revenue systems. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the economic implications of British revenue policies in India.  It demonstrates the need to analyze different approaches to revenue collection and their impact on the agrarian structure and the peasantry.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader       Newspaper Associated With
1. Dadabhai Naoroji              :   Kesari
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak           :   Voice of India
3. Sisir Kumar Ghosh             :   Amrita Bazar Patrika
4. Surendranath Banerjea        :   The Bengalee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall regarding the association of early nationalist leaders with specific newspapers.  Option (c) correctly identifies Sisir Kumar Ghosh as associated with the *Amrita Bazar Patrika* and Surendranath Banerjea with *The Bengalee*.  These are well-documented connections within the history of the Indian nationalist movement and the development of the Indian press.

Option (a) is incorrect because Dadabhai Naoroji is linked to the *Voice of India*, not *Kesari*. *Kesari* was primarily associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Option (b) is incorrect for the same reason, incorrectly pairing Naoroji with *Kesari*. Option (d) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pairing, omitting the correct association of Surendranath Banerjea with *The Bengalee*. The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their contributions to the nationalist movement through their journalistic endeavors.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge for accurate matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Measure                  Advocated By Early Indian Nationalists
1. Development of Agricultural Banks :   Curtailment of Jury Powers
2. Extension of Irrigation Facilities  :   Expansion of Technical Education
3. Improvement of Police System     :    Disarmament of the People
4. Spread of Primary Education      :   Opposition to Official Policies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the policy recommendations made by early Indian nationalists. Option (b) correctly identifies two key areas of focus:  the expansion of technical education and the spread of primary education among the masses.  These were integral parts of their broader agenda for social and economic reform, aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Indians and addressing the shortcomings of British rule.

Option (a) is incorrect because the development of agricultural banks was advocated to protect peasants from moneylenders, not linked to the curtailment of jury powers. Option (c) is incorrect because the improvement of the police system was advocated to enhance its honesty and efficiency, not directly related to the issue of disarming the people. While the nationalists opposed the disarmament policy, it's not a direct pairing with police reform. Option (d) is incomplete, only mentioning one correct pairing. The question tests not only factual recall but also the ability to analyze the interconnectedness of the early nationalists' demands for comprehensive societal improvement.  The distractors utilize related but incorrect pairings, demanding careful analysis of the policy context.


**3. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Method                    Description
1. Constitutional Agitation           :   Advocated by Extremist Nationalists
2. Slow, Orderly Political Progress   :   Characterized by Passive Resistance
3. Constitutional Agitation           :   Primarily employed by Moderate Nationalists
4. Active Propaganda in Britain       :   Focused on educating British Public Opinion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of the contrasting approaches of Moderate and Extremist nationalists. Option (c) correctly links "Constitutional Agitation" with the Moderate nationalists' preferred method and "Active Propaganda in Britain" with their strategy to influence British public opinion.  This accurately reflects the historical reality of the movement.

Option (a) is incorrect as Constitutional Agitation was the hallmark of the Moderates, not Extremists. Option (b) incorrectly associates "Slow, Orderly Political Progress" with Passive Resistance, which was more associated with the later Gandhian phase. While passive resistance was a form of protest, it wasn't the defining characteristic of the Moderate approach. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the false pairing of Extremists with Constitutional Agitation. The question demands a clear understanding of the different approaches to political action adopted by the two wings of the nationalist movement.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between the methods and philosophies of the two groups.


**4. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                  Characteristic Feature
1. Divide and Rule                        :   Encouraged alliances with princes and zamindars
2. Hostility towards Educated Indians   :   Supported social reforms actively
3. Attitude towards Zamindars            :   Used religious and caste divisions to weaken opposition
4. Attitude towards Social Reforms       :   Viewed emerging middle class as a challenge to authority


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of British policies and their impact on Indian society. Option (c) correctly matches "Divide and Rule" with the strategy of using religious and caste divisions and "Attitude towards Zamindars" with viewing the emerging middle class as a challenge to their authority.  These are well-established aspects of British colonial policy in India.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the British did ally with princes and zamindars, this is not the defining feature of "Divide and Rule".  "Divide and Rule" primarily focused on exploiting existing social divisions. Option (b) is incorrect because the British were hostile to social reforms that challenged established power structures, not supportive of them. Option (d) is incomplete, only offering one correct pairing. The question necessitates a nuanced understanding of British colonial strategies, requiring the candidate to differentiate between the core features of various policies.  The distractors present plausible but incorrect connections, making it challenging to select the correct option without a thorough understanding of the historical context.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Land Revenue System        Region of Implementation
1. Ryotwari System                    :   North-Western Provinces
2. Mahalwari System                   :   Bengal
3. Permanent Settlement               :   Madras Presidency
4. Ryotwari System                    :   Bombay Presidency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of the British land revenue systems and their geographical application. Option (d) correctly identifies the Ryotwari system's implementation in the Bombay Presidency.  This is a well-established fact in the study of British colonial administration in India.

Option (a) is incorrect because the Ryotwari system was not primarily implemented in the North-Western Provinces (Mahalwari was). Option (b) is incorrect because the Mahalwari system was not primarily implemented in Bengal (Permanent Settlement was). Option (c) is incorrect because the Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, not Madras Presidency (though it extended to parts of Madras). The question requires precise knowledge of the geographical spread of different revenue systems introduced by the British, testing the candidate's ability to recall specific details. The distractors cleverly use the names of the systems and regions, creating plausible incorrect pairings that demand careful consideration.


**1. With reference to the economic impact of British rule in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Phenomenon                     Impact/Characteristic
1. Deindustrialisation                       :   Decline of many Indian cities and ruralisation
2. Permanent Settlement System             :   Increased insecurity for tenants and loss of traditional land rights
3. Commercialisation of Agriculture         :   Increased cultivation of cash crops like cotton and jute for export

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Deindustrialisation under British rule led to the decline of traditional Indian industries, resulting in the migration of artisans to rural areas and a subsequent process of ruralisation. This is well documented in historical accounts detailing the devastating impact of British policies on Indian handicrafts. The Permanent Settlement System, while aiming to stabilize land revenue collection, resulted in increased insecurity for tenants who lost their traditional rights and faced arbitrary evictions by zamindars. The commercialisation of Indian agriculture saw a shift from subsistence farming to the cultivation of cash crops primarily for export to Britain, significantly altering the agrarian structure and increasing dependence on global market fluctuations.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognise the interconnectedness of these economic phenomena and their individual impact during British rule.  Option (a) is incomplete, option (b) neglects the significant changes in agriculture, and option (c) ignores the consequences of the Permanent Settlement on land tenure. The correct option (d) reflects a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted economic impact of British rule in India.


**2. With reference to the economic policies of the British in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                      Consequence
1. One-way free trade                         :   Flooding of Indian markets with cheap British manufactured goods
2. Heavy duties on Indian textiles in Britain :   Virtual closure of British markets to Indian exports after 1820
3.  Lack of investment in Indian industries   :   Deindustrialisation and loss of traditional livelihoods

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the consequences of British economic policies in India. The policy of one-way free trade, implemented after the Charter Act of 1813, allowed the free flow of British manufactured goods into India, while simultaneously erecting significant trade barriers against Indian products. This resulted in the inundation of the Indian market with cheaper British goods, severely impacting domestic industries and artisans. The imposition of heavy tariffs on Indian textiles entering Britain effectively closed European markets to Indian exports, crippling the Indian textile industry and contributing to widespread deindustrialisation. The British government's lack of investment in modernising Indian industries, coupled with the deliberate destruction of traditional industries, resulted in widespread deindustrialisation and the loss of traditional livelihoods for millions of artisans and craftsmen.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, failing to capture the full extent of the British economic policies' devastating effects. Only option (d) accurately reflects the interconnected nature of these policies and their consequences.


**3. With reference to the British impact on Indian agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy/Practice                      Result
1. Permanent Settlement                      :   Concentration of land ownership in the hands of Zamindars
2. Excessive land revenue demands           :   Increased peasant indebtedness and land alienation
3. Commercialization of agriculture          :    Shift towards cash crops impacting food security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs demonstrate accurate cause-and-effect relationships within the context of British agricultural policies in India. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal and other regions, concentrated land ownership in the hands of Zamindars, creating a powerful class of intermediaries who often exploited the peasantry. This system, while aimed at securing land revenue for the British, had the unintended consequence of exacerbating inequalities in land ownership and increasing the vulnerability of tenant farmers.  Excessive land revenue demands, often exceeding the capacity of the peasants to pay, drove many into cycles of indebtedness and eventually land alienation. This was further compounded by the lack of investment in agricultural infrastructure and technology by the British. The commercialisation of agriculture, driven by the demand for cash crops in the British market, further strained the agricultural sector.  The focus on cash crops like cotton and jute often came at the expense of food crops, leading to food insecurity and vulnerability to famines. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, failing to account for the multiple interconnected consequences of British agricultural policies. Option (d) correctly identifies the comprehensive impact of these policies on the Indian peasantry.


**4. With reference to the nationalist critique of the colonial economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Analyst                         Key Argument/Concept
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Theory of Economic Drain
2. Romesh Chandra Dutt                    :   Economic History of India
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                   :   Advocated for Swadeshi movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his seminal work *Poverty and Un-British Rule in India*, articulated the theory of economic drain, arguing that British rule systematically extracted wealth from India without providing adequate economic returns.  Romesh Chandra Dutt’s *Economic History of India* provided a detailed analysis of the economic impact of British rule, highlighting the deindustrialisation of India and the impoverishment of the peasantry.  While Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent nationalist leader, his primary contribution was not the development of a specific economic theory but his advocacy for various socio-economic reforms, including the Swadeshi movement. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched. Option (a) accurately identifies the correct pairings, while options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect matches. The correct option reflects a sound understanding of the key figures and their contributions to the nationalist economic critique of British rule.


**5.  With reference to the stages of colonialism in India as identified by Marxist historians, consider the following pairs:**

   Stage of Colonialism                     Characteristic Feature
1.  Merchant Capital (Mercantilism)        :   Monopoly of trade with India and direct appropriation of governmental revenues
2. Colonialism of Free Trade                :   Integration of India's economy with the British and world capitalist economy through free trade
3. Era of Foreign Investments                :   Large-scale British capital investment in railways, loans, and other sectors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately describe the characteristics of the stages of colonialism in India as analyzed by Marxist historians. The first stage, characterized by merchant capital or mercantilism, focused on establishing a trade monopoly and directly appropriating state revenues. The East India Company's actions during this period exemplify this approach. The second stage, known as colonialism of free trade, saw the integration of India's economy into the broader British and global capitalist system through the implementation of free trade policies. This period witnessed the dismantling of trade barriers and the opening of Indian markets to British manufactured goods. The third stage, marked by foreign investments, saw a surge in British capital investment in various sectors, including railways, loans to the Indian government, and plantations. These investments further entrenched British economic dominance and facilitated the extraction of resources from India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete, failing to encompass all three correctly matched stages. Only option (c) provides a complete and accurate representation of the Marxist historical analysis of the stages of colonialism in India.  The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of Marxist interpretations of historical processes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mughal Emperor           Event/Policy
1. Aurangzeb                 :   Introduction of Jizya tax
2. Muhammad Shah            :   Establishment of independent states of Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh, and Punjab
3. Bahadur Shah I            :   Adoption of a pacific policy with Marathas, Rajputs, and Jats
4. Jahandar Shah             :   Abolition of Jaziya tax
5. Farrukhsiyar               :   Grant of farmans to the British

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Aurangzeb's reign is indeed associated with the re-imposition of the Jizya tax, a regressive policy that alienated many Hindu subjects.  Muhammad Shah's weak rule led to the emergence of independent states, signifying the decline of Mughal central authority. Bahadur Shah I, in contrast to his father, adopted a more conciliatory approach towards powerful groups like the Marathas, Rajputs, and Jats, aiming for stability. Farrukhsiyar granted farmans (edicts) to the British East India Company, bestowing certain trade privileges.  Option (d) is incorrect because Jahandar Shah abolished the Jaziya tax, contradicting the information presented.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the historical context of the Mughal emperors and their associated events/policies.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Mughal decline.


**2. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor                       Specific Example

2. Jagirdari crisis             :   Acute shortage of jagirs leading to bejagiri
3. Rise of regional aspirations :   The Maratha bid for imperial power
4. External invasions           :   Nadir Shah's loot of Delhi
5. Shifting allegiance of Zamindars :  Regional Zamindars aiding ambitious nobles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are accurately matched to illustrate factors contributing to the Mughal decline. Alamgir II's assassination highlights the instability and violence that plagued the later Mughal era. The jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of land grants (jagirs), led to the practice of bejagiri (holding a jagir without proper assignment), further destabilizing the empire's revenue system. The Marathas' ambition to inherit the Mughal mantle demonstrates the rise of regional powers challenging central authority. Nadir Shah's invasion and sack of Delhi represent a significant external threat that weakened the empire. The shifting allegiance of zamindars, who supported ambitious nobles, indicates the erosion of loyalty to the Mughal center.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted causes of the Mughal Empire's decline. This question assesses factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.

4. Battle of Buxar             :   British acquisition of Diwani rights over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa
5. Battle of Wandiwash         :   Decisive defeat of the French in the Third Carnatic War


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a significant 18th-century battle with its direct consequence or broader historical importance. The Battle of Ambur resulted in the death of Anwaruddin Khan, a key figure in the Carnatic Wars. The Battle of Plassey led to the installation of Mir Jafar as the Nawab of Bengal, marking a turning point in British expansion. The Third Battle of Panipat decisively ended Maratha ambitions for all-India dominion. The Battle of Buxar resulted in the British gaining the Diwani rights, giving them control over the revenue of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  The Battle of Wandiwash secured British supremacy over the French in South India.  Thus, option (c) encompasses all correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a robust understanding of the military and political landscape of 18th-century India.

All five pairs accurately define key administrative terms prevalent in 18th-century India.  Diwani refers to the right to collect revenue, a crucial aspect of governance. Zamindars were hereditary landholders who played a significant role in the revenue system. Faujdars were responsible for maintaining law and order in districts. Kotwals held similar responsibilities but within cities. Jagirdars were the recipients of land grants (jagirs), often in return for military service. The question tests the understanding of the administrative vocabulary and the structures of governance during that period. Option (c) is thus the correct answer, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the administrative framework of the time.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of administrative terms.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early European Trading Company   |   Earliest Indian Factory Location
   1. Portuguese                     |   Goa
   2. Dutch                          |   Masulipatnam
   3. French                         |   Surat
   4. English                        |   Pulicat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Portuguese established their earliest factory in India at Goa.  While they later expanded to other locations, Goa marks their initial presence. Option (b) is incorrect because the Dutch established their earliest factory in Masulipatnam, not Pulicat.  Option (c) is incorrect because the French established their earliest factory in Surat, not Pulicat, and the English did not establish their first factory in Surat. Option (d) incorrectly pairs the Dutch and French with inaccurate locations. The question tests factual recall of the earliest trading posts of different European powers in India and necessitates a precise understanding of their initial locations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (like Pulicat and Masulipatnam) increases the difficulty level, ensuring that superficial knowledge is insufficient for a correct response.


**2. With reference to the early stages of European presence in India, consider the following pairs:**

   European Power      |   Initial Major Trading Hub
   1.  Portuguese         |   Calcutta
   2.  Dutch             |   Cochin
   3.  English           |   Surat

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Surat served as the primary trading hub for the English East India Company in its early years.  The other options contain inaccuracies. The Portuguese initially focused on Calicut and Cochin, not Calcutta.  The Dutch, while having a presence in Cochin, initially prioritized other locations like Masulipatnam. The French initially established themselves in Surat before developing Pondicherry as their major base. This question assesses the understanding of the geographical spread and strategic choices of various European powers during their initial phase in India.  The subtle inaccuracies in the distractor options demand careful analysis and accurate factual recall to arrive at the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early European Company Action |  Consequence/Result
   1.  Portuguese conquest of Goa  |   Established first European foothold in India.
   2.  French occupation of Madras |   Led to the first Carnatic War.
   3.  English acquisition of Bombay |  Shifted the Western Presidency headquarters from Surat.

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510 established their first major foothold in India. The French seizure of Madras in 1746 triggered the First Carnatic War. The English acquisition of Bombay in 1668 eventually led to its becoming the headquarters of the Western Presidency, replacing Surat. Finally, the Mughal capture of Hooghly in 1632 represented a significant setback for the Portuguese in Bengal. This question tests the candidate's understanding of cause-and-effect relationships in the historical context of European expansion in India. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this question challenging, requiring comprehensive knowledge of the events.


**4. With reference to the establishment of European power in India, consider the following pairs:**

   European Company  |   Significant Early Acquisition/Event

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The English obtained the Diwani rights in Bengal, granting them control over revenue collection. The Dutch conquered Ceylon (Sri Lanka).  Option (c) is incorrect; while the French traded in Masulipatnam, they did not gain complete control in the same way as the English in Bengal or the Dutch in Ceylon. The Portuguese did not fortify Surat; early attempts were thwarted by Mughal authorities. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key events marking the expansion of various European powers, requiring precise understanding of their territorial acquisitions and control. The inclusion of partially correct and completely incorrect pairs enhances the difficulty, demanding precise knowledge.

   3. First Anglo-Maratha War |   Resulted in a treaty maintaining the status quo.
   4. Anglo-Mysore Wars    |   Weakened Mysore and strengthened British control in South India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Battle of Plassey (1757) solidified British dominance in Bengal. The Battle of Wandiwash (1760) decisively ended French aspirations for extensive political control in India. The First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-1782) concluded with the Treaty of Salbai, essentially maintaining the existing territorial balance. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (multiple wars between 1766-1799) significantly weakened Mysore and increased British influence in South India.  This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of major military conflicts and their long-term consequences in shaping the British Empire in India.  The inclusion of all correct options demands thorough knowledge of the wars and their effects.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early European Trading Company in India       Establishment/Significant Event
1. Portuguese East India Company              :   Capture of Goa in 1510
2. Dutch East India Company                   :   Establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam in 1605

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Portuguese significantly expanded their influence in India with the capture of Goa in 1510 under Afonso de Albuquerque. This marked a shift from primarily trading activities to territorial control. The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in Masulipatnam in 1605, initiating their presence on the Coromandel Coast. The French East India Company founded Pondicherry in 1674, which later became a crucial center of French power in India. The English East India Company secured the three villages of Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur in 1698, laying the foundation for the future city of Calcutta. These events represent critical milestones in the establishment and expansion of European trading companies in India during the early modern period, highlighting their gradual transition from mere traders to significant political players.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the early establishment of European power in India, consider the following pairs:**

   European Power          Key Location/Action
1. Portuguese              :   Establishment of Fort St. George in Madras
2. Dutch                    :   Capture of Nagapatnam from the Portuguese
3. French                   :   Construction of fortifications at Chandernagore
4. English                  :   Acquisition of Bombay from Portugal in 1668

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect historical events. The Dutch captured Nagapatnam from the Portuguese, establishing a significant presence on the Coromandel Coast. The French constructed fortifications at Chandernagore, near Calcutta, solidifying their position in Bengal.  The English acquired Bombay from Portugal in 1668, which eventually became a major center of English power on the west coast of India. However, the establishment of Fort St. George in Madras was undertaken by the English, not the Portuguese, making statement 1 incorrect. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the 18th-century Anglo-French rivalry in India, consider the following pairs:**

   War                       Outcome/Significant Event
1. First Carnatic War        :   Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Madras returned to the English.
2. Second Carnatic War       :   Capture of Arcot by Robert Clive
3. Third Carnatic War        :   Battle of Wandiwash, decisive English victory.
4. Anglo-Mysore Wars       :   Treaty of Mangalore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The First Carnatic War concluded with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which resulted in Madras being returned to the English.  The Second Carnatic War saw Robert Clive's audacious capture of Arcot, a significant turning point in the conflict. The Third Carnatic War culminated in the decisive Battle of Wandiwash, securing a major English victory. The Treaty of Mangalore, however, concluded the Second Anglo-Mysore War, not directly related to the Carnatic Wars.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mughal Emperor         Significant Event related to the East India Company
1. Aurangzeb                :   Granted the Company zamindari rights in Bengal
2. Farrukhsiyar              :   Issued the "Golden Farman" granting trading privileges.
3. Shah Alam II              :   Granted the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa to the Company.
4. Jahangir                 :   Granted the English permission to establish a factory at Surat.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Aurangzeb did grant the Company certain land rights in Bengal, the specific grant of zamindari rights as described in option 1 is not entirely accurate. The "Golden Farman" is associated with the Golconda Sultanate, not Farrukhsiyar. Shah Alam II indeed granted the Diwani rights to the Company.  Jahangir granted the English permission to establish a factory at Surat. Therefore, options 3 and 4 are correctly matched, while 1 and 2 are not perfectly accurate. Option (c) is the most appropriate choice, acknowledging the partial accuracy of statement 1.  Options (a), (b), and (d) either include fully incorrect pairs or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the evolution of the East India Company, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                  Characteristic
1.  Charter of 1600                          :   Granted a 15-year trading monopoly
2.  Amalgamation of 1708                     :   Created the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies.
3.  Regulating Act of 1773                   :   Established the Board of Control
4.  Pitt's India Act of 1784                  :   Increased government control over the Company

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Charter of 1600 granted the East India Company a 15-year trading monopoly. The amalgamation of 1708 did indeed create the United Company of Merchants. Pitt's India Act of 1784 significantly increased government control over the Company.  However, the Regulating Act of 1773 established a Governor-General and Council in Bengal, and a Supreme Court at Calcutta, not the Board of Control. The Board of Control was created by Pitt's India Act. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (a) correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Governor-General/Viceroy        Significant Policy/Action
1. Lord Cornwallis                         :   Introduction of the Permanent Settlement
2. Lord Wellesley                           :   Implementation of the Subsidiary Alliance System
3. Lord Dalhousie                          :   Doctrine of Lapse
4. Lord Curzon                              :   Partition of Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lord Cornwallis is known for introducing the Permanent Settlement in Bengal. Lord Wellesley implemented the Subsidiary Alliance System, expanding British influence in India. Lord Dalhousie is associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy that led to the annexation of several Indian states. While Lord Curzon is linked to the Partition of Bengal, it's important to note that the partition was reversed later. Therefore, the first three pairs are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Option (d) incorrectly includes the association of Curzon with the Partition of Bengal. Options (a) and (c) are also incomplete.


**7. With reference to the administrative structure of British India, consider the following pairs:**

   Level of Government              Key Feature/Responsibility
1. Central Government              :   Collection of land revenue in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa after 1765
2. Provincial Government             :   Implementation of the Indian Police Act of 1861
3. Local Government                  :   Establishment of municipalities and district boards

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Central Government in British India assumed the responsibility for collecting land revenue in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa after the Battle of Buxar. Provincial governments played a crucial role in the implementation of the Indian Police Act of 1861, establishing a more formalized police system.  Local governments were instrumental in the establishment and administration of municipalities and district boards, furthering the decentralization of administrative functions. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation/Act                          Impact on Indian Governance
1. Regulating Act of 1773                  :   Established a system of checks and balances in the Company's administration.
2. Pitt's India Act of 1784                  :   Created a Board of Control to oversee the Company's affairs.
3. Charter Act of 1813                      :   Ended the Company's trade monopoly in India (except for tea and China trade).
4. Charter Act of 1833                      :   Officially declared the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Regulating Act of 1773 aimed to establish a degree of control and accountability within the Company's administration, although the system of checks and balances was imperfect. Pitt's India Act of 1784 established the Board of Control to supervise the Company's activities. The Charter Act of 1813 ended the Company's monopoly over most Indian trade, except for tea and trade with China.  The Charter Act of 1833 formally designated the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India, centralizing power.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.  Other options are incomplete.


**9.  With reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS) under British rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform/Act                                     Impact
1. Cornwallis's reforms                         :   Established a system of fixed salaries and seniority-based promotions.
2. Wellesley's establishment of Fort William College :   Provided initial training for ICS recruits in India.
3. Charter Act of 1853                          :   Introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment.
4. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861             :   Made the ICS examination exclusively in India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cornwallis's reforms aimed to improve the efficiency and integrity of the ICS by introducing a system of fixed salaries and a meritocratic promotion system based on seniority.  Wellesley's Fort William College provided early training for ICS recruits, although this was later replaced by the Haileybury College in England. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations, a significant step towards meritocracy.  However, the ICS examination was not exclusively held in India; it continued to be held in England. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect statements.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Police Reform/Policy                      Administrator/Period
1. Establishment of Faujdar Thanas          :   Warren Hastings
2. Introduction of a regular police force     :   Lord Cornwallis
3. Recommendations of the Frazer Commission :   Lord Curzon's period
4. Indian Police Act of 1861                :   Lord Dalhousie's period

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Warren Hastings is associated with the establishment of Faujdar Thanas as part of his efforts to improve law and order. Lord Cornwallis is credited with organizing a more regular and structured police force.  The recommendations of the Frazer Commission were implemented during Lord Curzon's tenure.  However, the Indian Police Act of 1861 was passed during the period of other administrators and not under Lord Dalhousie. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include mismatched pairs.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

War                                      Outcome
1. First Anglo-Mysore War              : Hyder Ali was defeated
2. Second Anglo-Mysore War           : Hyder Ali defeated the British
3. Third Anglo-Mysore War             : Tipu Sultan won the battle and did not cede his territory to the British
4. Fourth Anglo-Mysore War            : Tipu was defeated and killed

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-1769) concluded with the Treaty of Madras, which saw Hyder Ali's defeat. The Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780-1784) resulted in a stalemate, with neither side achieving a decisive victory, contrary to option (2).  The Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789-1792) ended with Tipu Sultan's defeat, contradicting option (3). The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799) led to Tipu Sultan's death and the end of the Kingdom of Mysore, aligning with option (4). Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs based on the historical outcomes of the Anglo-Mysore Wars.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Person                                 Fact
1. Dalip Singh, ex-Maharaja of Punjab  : Died in Paris on 23 October 1893
2. Dalip Singh, ex-Maharaja of Punjab  : Cremated at Nasik
3. Dalip Singh, ex-Maharaja of Punjab  : Never renounced the Sikh faith
4. Dalip Singh, ex-Maharaja of Punjab  : Never visited Russia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Dalip Singh, the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, did indeed die in Paris on October 23, 1893, making option 1 correct.  Options 2 and 4 are incorrect; he was buried in London, not cremated at Nasik and he did visit Russia. Option 3 is also incorrect, as he did convert to Christianity later in his life.  Therefore, only option 1 accurately reflects a verifiable fact about Dalip Singh's life.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Governor of Bengal                     Appointed By
1. Sarfraz Khan                         : Mughal Emperor
2. Murshid Quli Khan                   : Mughal Emperor
3. Alivardi Khan                         : Mughal Emperor
4. Shujauddin Muhammad Khan           : Mughal Emperor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Shujauddin Muhammad Khan was the last Governor of Bengal appointed by the Mughal Emperor.  Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. While Murshid Quli Khan, Alivardi Khan, and Sarfaraz Khan were all significant figures in the history of Bengal, they were not appointed by the Mughal Emperor in the same manner as later governors were appointed by the British.  The decline of Mughal power meant that the appointment of these individuals to such high office was a complex process involving local power dynamics and less formal imperial authority.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Location                               Church Constructed By Begum Samru
1. Mount Abu                             : Begum Samru
2. Nainital                              : Begum Samru
3. Sardhana                              : Begum Samru
4. Kanpur                                : Begum Samru

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Begum Samru, a notable figure in 18th-century India, constructed a prominent church in Sardhana. Options 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect.  While Begum Samru held significant power and influence in the region, she did not construct churches in Mount Abu, Nainital, or Kanpur.  The Sardhana church stands as a testament to her legacy and her religious tolerance, representing a unique example of architectural and historical significance.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Emperor of India                         British East India Company Formation
1. Akbar                                 : 1600
2. Jahangir                              : 1600
3. Shah Jahan                            : 1600
4. Aurangzeb                             : 1600

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The British East India Company was formed in 1600, but none of the listed Mughal emperors can be definitively linked to its formation.  The Company's establishment predates the reigns of these emperors, and the Mughal Empire's influence on the Company's creation was indirect. The Company's operations in India began to significantly impact Mughal politics much later.  All options are incorrect because they attempt to create a direct causal link between a specific Mughal emperor and the Company's founding, which is not historically accurate.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Location                               Portuguese First Fortress
1. Anjidiv                               : First Portuguese Fortress
2. Cannanore                            : First Portuguese Fortress
3. Cochin                                : First Fortress in India
4. Goa                                   : First Portuguese Fortress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Portuguese built their first fortress in India at Anjidiv.  The other options are incorrect. While the Portuguese established a presence in Cannanore, Cochin, and Goa, Anjidiv represents their initial fortified establishment in India.  The sequence of Portuguese fortification construction reflects their gradual expansion along the Indian coast, with Anjidiv marking the earliest significant foothold.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Battle                                     Year
1. Pollilur                               : 1780
2. Hyderabad                             : 1780
3. Srirangapatna                          : 1780
4. Nizamabad                             : 1780

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Tipu Sultan defeated the British army at Pollilur in 1780. Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. While battles involving Tipu Sultan and the British occurred near Hyderabad, Srirangapatna, and Nizamabad at different points in time, the specific battle at Pollilur in 1780 represents a key victory for Tipu Sultan in the Second Anglo-Mysore War.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

First Europeans to Trade in India        Nationality
1. Dutch                                 : First to Trade in India
2. English                               : First to Trade in India
3. French                                : First to Trade in India
4. Portuguese                            : First to Trade in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in India for trade.  The other options are incorrect.  While the Dutch, English, and French subsequently established significant trading presence in India, the Portuguese predate them, establishing their presence in the late 15th century.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding Pondicherry:**

Statement                                Correctness
1. Portuguese were the first to occupy Pondicherry : True/False
2. French were the second to occupy Pondicherry  : True/False
3. English never occupied Pondicherry            : True/False

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The French were the second European power to occupy Pondicherry after the Portuguese. The English never controlled Pondicherry. Option 1 is incorrect as the Portuguese initially held Pondicherry. Option 2 is correct because the French subsequently took control of Pondicherry. Option 3 is also correct as the British never directly controlled Pondicherry.  The history of Pondicherry illustrates the competition between European powers for control of strategic Indian coastal locations.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

Battle                                   Commander
1. Plassey                               : Lord Clive
2. Buxar                                 : Lord Clive
3. Munger                                : Lord Clive

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Clive was the commander at the Battles of Plassey and Buxar.  Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. While Clive was a significant figure in the British conquest of India, he was not the commander at the battles of Munger and Wandiwash.  These battles involved other British commanders during different phases of the conflict.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

Governor-General                       Grant of Diwani Rights
1. Lord Clive                            : Bengal, Bihar, Odisha
2. Lord Cornwallis                       : Bengal, Bihar, Odisha
3. Lord Wellesley                         : Bengal, Bihar, Odisha
4. Lord William Bentinck                 : Bengal, Bihar, Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Clive was the Governor-General during which the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha were granted to the East India Company by Emperor Shah Alam II. Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.  While these Governors-General played significant roles in consolidating British power, the formal grant of Diwani rights is specifically linked to Lord Clive's tenure.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

Territory                               Included in Ranjit Singh's Kingdom
1. Delhi                                 : Ranjit Singh's Kingdom
2. Kabul                                 : Ranjit Singh's Kingdom
3. Makran                                : Ranjit Singh's Kingdom
4. Srinagar                               : Ranjit Singh's Kingdom

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Srinagar was included in Ranjit Singh's kingdom. Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect.  While Ranjit Singh's kingdom expanded significantly, it did not include Delhi, Kabul, or Makran.  His control extended primarily over Punjab and surrounding areas, establishing a powerful Sikh state in the region.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

**15. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following pairs:**

Emperor                                  Significant Event/Policy
1. Aurangzeb                             : Abolition of Jizya tax
2. Bahadur Shah I                         :  Capture of Lohgarh fort
3. Jahandar Shah                          : Appointment of Zulfiqar Khan as Wazir
4. Farrukhsiyar                            : Dethronement by Sayyid brothers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Jahandar Shah's reign was significantly marked by the appointment of Zulfiqar Khan as his Wazir, who implemented significant administrative and political changes.  Farrukhsiyar's reign ended with his dethronement and subsequent death at the hands of the Sayyid brothers, highlighting the power struggles within the Mughal court. Option 1 is incorrect because Aurangzeb is known for *imposing* the Jizya tax, not abolishing it. Option 2 is incorrect because while Bahadur Shah I did campaign against Banda Bahadur and Lohgarh was a significant Sikh stronghold, the fort's capture wasn't a definitive, lasting victory that significantly altered the course of the empire's decline.


**16. With reference to the Mughal administrative structure, consider the following pairs:**

Term                                    Definition/Association
1. Mansabdar                             : Hereditary landholders

4. Ijara                                 : Land grant in lieu of service

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Ijara refers to the revenue-farming system prevalent in the Mughal Empire. Option 1 is incorrect; Mansabdars were military commanders holding specific ranks and not hereditary landholders.  Option 2 is incorrect; Zamindars were hereditary landholders responsible for revenue collection, not military commanders. Option 3 is incorrect; Jagir was a land grant given to nobles in lieu of service, not a revenue-farming system.  The Mughal administrative system involved a complex interplay of these terms, and understanding their precise definitions is crucial for comprehending the empire's structure.


**17. With reference to the 18th-century Indian political landscape, consider the following pairs:**

State                                   Founder/Key Figure

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Saadat Khan (Burhan-ul-Mulk) founded the independent state of Awadh. Murshid Quli Khan established the independent state of Bengal. Nizam-ul-Mulk founded the state of Hyderabad. Option 4 is incorrect; While Chikka Krishna Raj was a ruler of Mysore, Haidar Ali is considered the true founder of the independent Mysore state in the 18th century. The emergence of these regional powers represents a significant aspect of the decline of Mughal authority and the rise of new political entities in India.


**18. With reference to the regional powers that emerged during the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following pairs:**

Power                                  Characteristic

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Jat power initially emerged from a peasant revolt. The Marathas suffered a significant defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat against Ahmad Shah Abdali. Ranjit Singh successfully consolidated the Sikh power, creating a strong kingdom in the Punjab. Option 4 is incorrect; The Rajputs' relationship with the Mughals was complex and not consistently an alliance throughout the 18th century.  These regional powers played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of 18th-century India.


**19. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in 18th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

Aspect                                 Description
1. Agriculture                           : Technologically advanced

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

18th-century India did have a significant shipbuilding industry. Options 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect.  Agriculture was technologically backward, trade was both internal and external, and access to modern scientific education was limited. The socio-economic conditions of 18th-century India provide a crucial backdrop to understanding the political changes of the period.


**20. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following pairs:**

Leader                                 Region/Role

2. Economic grievances                 :  High taxes and widespread poverty.
3. Military grievances                  :  Discrimination against Indian sepoys and low pay.
4. Political grievances                 :  Policy of annexation and disregard for Indian rulers' rights.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Religious concerns, economic grievances, military grievances, and political grievances all contributed to the Revolt of 1857. The fear of religious conversion fueled by missionary activities, high taxes and widespread poverty, discrimination against Indian sepoys and low pay, and the policy of annexation and disregard for Indian rulers’ rights all played significant roles in inciting the revolt.  These factors highlight the complex interplay of social, economic, and political issues that led to this major uprising.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Factory in Bengal           Established by
1. Bandel                     :   Portuguese
2. Chinsurah                   :   Dutch
3. Hooghly                     :   English
4. Shrirampur                  :   British

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The prompt mentions that among factories in Bengal, the one established by the Portuguese was not specified.  However, the provided text clearly states that the Dutch established a trading depot at Chinsurah in Bengal.  Option (a) is incorrect because while the Portuguese did have a presence in Bengal, the specific factory they established isn't named in the source. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched Portuguese factory. Option (d) is partially correct regarding Chinsurah but incorrectly includes Hooghly as an English establishment.  The precise origins of the Hooghly factory are not detailed in the given text.  While the English certainly had a significant presence and later established Fort William in Calcutta, the establishment of the Hooghly factory is not definitively attributed to them in this particular source. Therefore, only option (b) is demonstrably correct based on the provided information.  The question highlights the need for precise factual recall and the ability to discern definitively verifiable information from plausible but ultimately unconfirmed statements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   European Power       Chronological Order of Entry into Indian Trade
1. English                 :   1
2. Dutch                    :   2
3. French                   :   3
4. Portuguese               :   4

(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4, 2, 1, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4, 2, 1, and 3

**Explanation:**

The correct chronological order of entry of European powers into Indian trade is Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French.  The provided text explicitly supports this sequence. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the English, disregarding the earlier arrivals of the Portuguese and Dutch. Option (b) is incorrect because, while it correctly places the English and Dutch, it ignores the earlier Portuguese presence and the later arrival of the French. Option (c) is incorrect as it only lists the Portuguese, leaving out the other three powers. Option (d) accurately reflects the historical order presented in the source material, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of European involvement in Indian trade during the early modern period. The question tests factual recall and the ability to arrange historical events chronologically.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                           Role in Establishing French Company in India
1. Richelieu                         : Founder
2. Mazarin                           :  Key Financier
3. Colbert                          :  Policy Architect
4. Franco Martin                     : Early Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions Colbert's role in establishing the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (French East India Company) and Franco Martin's role as an early governor of Pondicherry, a crucial French settlement in India.  While Richelieu and Mazarin were prominent figures in French history, their direct involvement in the founding of the French East India Company is not explicitly mentioned, making options (c) and (d) incorrect.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the significant contribution of Franco Martin. Option (b) accurately identifies Colbert's policy role and Martin's administrative role in the early establishment and governance of the French East India Company in India. This question tests factual knowledge of key figures and their roles in the establishment of European trading companies in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Battle                                  Significance
1. Battle of Buxar                         : Established British supremacy in Bengal
2. Battle of Plassey                        : Ended the Anglo-French rivalry in India
3. Battle of Wandiwash                     : Led to the establishment of the French East India Company

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Battle of Buxar decisively established British supremacy in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  The Battle of Plassey was a crucial step towards British dominance in Bengal, but it did not end the Anglo-French rivalry; that only concluded later with the Battle of Wandiwash. The Battle of Wandiwash decisively ended the Anglo-French struggle in India, but it had nothing to do with the establishment of the French East India Company.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are all incorrect because they misrepresent the significance of the battles. Only option (a) accurately reflects the historical impact of the Battle of Buxar, demonstrating an understanding of the pivotal battles in the establishment of British power in India.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between the significance of different historical events.


**5. With reference to the early European settlements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Settlement             Acquired From
1. Madras                 :  Chandragiri Raja
2. Bombay                 :  Portugal
3. Calcutta               :  Zamindars of Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The English East India Company obtained Madras through a lease agreement with the Chandragiri Raja in 1639.  They acquired Bombay from Portugal in 1668.  The Company purchased the zamindari rights to the three villages of Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur to establish Calcutta.  All three pairs are correctly matched according to the provided text. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.  Option (c) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the origins of these three major British settlements in India. The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to link settlements with their original owners or grantors.


**6. With reference to the establishment of British power in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General            Significant Policy/Action
1. Lord Wellesley              : Doctrine of Lapse
2. Lord Dalhousie             : Subsidiary Alliances
3. Lord Curzon                 :  Expansion of British influence in Tibet

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Dalhousie is known for his aggressive implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy that significantly expanded British control over Indian states. Lord Curzon's actions in Tibet, through the Younghusband expedition, resulted in a treaty that expanded British influence in the region.  Lord Wellesley is primarily associated with the Subsidiary Alliance system, not the Doctrine of Lapse. Option (a) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes the Doctrine of Lapse to Lord Wellesley. Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes Subsidiary Alliances to Lord Dalhousie. Option (c) is incorrect as it only considers Curzon's actions. Option (d) correctly matches Lord Dalhousie with the Doctrine of Lapse and Lord Curzon with his expansionist policy in Tibet, highlighting the different approaches to expanding British influence in India during different periods. The question assesses the ability to associate policies with the correct Governor-Generals.


**7.  With reference to the Anglo-Mysore Wars, consider the following pairs:**

   War                               Treaty
1. First Anglo-Mysore War          : Treaty of Mangalore
2. Second Anglo-Mysore War         : Treaty of Seringapatam

The First Anglo-Mysore War concluded with the Treaty of Madras. The Second Anglo-Mysore War ended with the Treaty of Mangalore. The Third Anglo-Mysore War concluded with the Treaty of Seringapatam. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair the wars with their concluding treaties. Only option (b) correctly identifies the Treaty of Madras as concluding the First Anglo-Mysore War, demonstrating a clear understanding of the chronological sequence of events in the Anglo-Mysore conflict and the associated treaties.  The question tests accurate recall of historical events and their associated treaties.


**8. With reference to the Anglo-Maratha Wars, consider the following pairs:**

   War                       Treaty
1. First Anglo-Maratha War  : Treaty of Bassein
2. Second Anglo-Maratha War : Treaty of Salbai
3. Third Anglo-Maratha War  : Treaty of Poona

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The First Anglo-Maratha War concluded with the Treaty of Salbai. The Second Anglo-Maratha War did not have a single definitive treaty, but several treaties were signed with different Maratha leaders. The Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the Treaty of Poona. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link the wars with their concluding treaties. Only option (b) correctly pairs the Third Anglo-Maratha War with the Treaty of Poona, demonstrating an understanding of the major treaties that concluded the Anglo-Maratha conflicts. The question tests the ability to connect specific wars with their associated treaties.



**9. With reference to the acquisition of territories by the British East India Company, consider the following pairs:**

   Territory                      Method of Acquisition
1. Bengal                         :  Military Conquest and subsequent treaties
2. Mysore                          :  Subsidiary Alliance
3. Punjab                          :  Doctrine of Lapse

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The British acquired Bengal primarily through military conquest, culminating in treaties that formalized their control.  Mysore's acquisition involved a combination of war and the imposition of a subsidiary alliance, not solely the subsidiary alliance. Punjab's annexation was a result of the Anglo-Sikh Wars and not directly through the Doctrine of Lapse, although the doctrine played a role in the British expansionist policies of the period. Option (b) is incorrect because it wrongly includes Mysore as acquired solely through a subsidiary alliance. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly includes Punjab as being acquired through the Doctrine of Lapse. Option (d) is incorrect as it wrongly includes Punjab. Only option (a) correctly identifies the primary method of the British acquisition of Bengal as military conquest and subsequent treaties, demonstrating an understanding of the diverse methods used by the British to expand their control in India.  The question tests knowledge of the different methods used by the British to acquire territories.


**10. With reference to the early 19th-century conflicts in India, consider the following pairs:**

1. First Anglo-Afghan War           :  British East India Company and Dost Mohammad
2. First Anglo-Sikh War              :  British East India Company and Ranjit Singh
3. First Anglo-Burmese War           : British East India Company and Tipu Sultan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The First Anglo-Afghan War was primarily a conflict between the British East India Company and Dost Mohammad, the then ruler of Afghanistan. The First Anglo-Sikh War was fought between the British East India Company and the Sikh kingdom after Ranjit Singh's death, not during his reign.  The First Anglo-Burmese War did not involve Tipu Sultan; he was already deceased by this time, and the war was with the Burmese kingdom. Option (b) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the First Anglo-Sikh War. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the First Anglo-Burmese War and omits the correct pairing. Option (d) is incorrect as it only includes an incorrect pairing. Only option (a) correctly identifies the primary contending parties in the First Anglo-Afghan War, demonstrating an understanding of the key players in early 19th-century conflicts in the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The question tests the ability to accurately identify the main participants in different conflicts.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the decline of the Mughal Empire and the rise of British power in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Mughal Emperor          Significant Event/Policy
    1. Aurangzeb              : Abolition of Jizya tax
    2. Bahadur Shah I         :  Conquest of Lohgarh Fort from Sikhs
    3. Muhammad Shah        :  Defeat at the Battle of Karnal by Nadir Shah
    4. Alamgir II             :  Battle of Plassey

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Aurangzeb is known for *reimposing* the Jizya tax, not abolishing it.  This is a key detail often tested in UPSC exams.  Bahadur Shah I did indeed lead a campaign against Banda Bahadur and temporarily captured Lohgarh Fort, though the Sikhs later retook it.  Muhammad Shah's reign saw the devastating defeat at Karnal by Nadir Shah, a pivotal moment in Mughal decline.  The Battle of Plassey occurred during the reign of Alamgir II, marking a significant step in the British conquest of India.  Option (a) is incorrect because Aurangzeb didn't abolish the Jizya tax. Option (b) is incorrect because Aurangzeb's association with Jizya is the opposite of the given statement. Option (d) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of Muhammad Shah with the Battle of Karnal.


**2. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                     Impact
    1. Wars of Succession      : Weakening of Central Authority
    2. Jagirdari Crisis         :  Increased Peasant Oppression
    3. Rise of Regional Powers :  Strengthening of Mughal Control
    4. Aurangzeb’s Religious Policy :  Improved Hindu-Muslim Relations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The frequent wars of succession significantly weakened the central authority of the Mughal Empire, leading to instability and fragmentation. The Jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of land grants and increased demands on peasants, resulted in widespread peasant oppression and discontent. The rise of regional powers directly challenged Mughal control, leading to the disintegration of the empire. Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the reimposition of the Jizya tax, strained Hindu-Muslim relations, contributing to unrest and rebellion. Option (b) is incorrect because the rise of regional powers directly weakened the Mughals, not strengthened them. Option (c) is incomplete; the question asks for all the correct pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because Aurangzeb's religious policy did not improve Hindu-Muslim relations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    British Act/Policy        Provision/Consequence
    1. Regulating Act of 1773:  Established a Board of Control
    2. Pitt's India Act of 1784:  Increased the Governor-General's powers
    3. Charter Act of 1813    : Ended the Company's trade monopoly completely
    4. Charter Act of 1833    :  Officially ended slavery in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Regulating Act of 1773 established a Supreme Court in Calcutta, not a Board of Control. The Board of Control was created by Pitt's India Act of 1784. Pitt's India Act also substantially increased the Governor-General's powers, making him supreme over the presidencies of Bombay and Madras. The Charter Act of 1813 partially ended the Company's trade monopoly, not completely.  It opened trade to private British merchants, excluding trade with China and tea. The Charter Act of 1833 did not end slavery; it urged steps towards its abolition, which was finally achieved in 1843.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Charter Act of 1813 did not completely end the trade monopoly and the Regulating Act of 1773 was not associated with the Board of Control. Option (c) is incorrect because the Regulating Act of 1773 did not establish the Board of Control and the Charter Act of 1833 did not end slavery. Option (d) is incomplete; it only includes one correct pair.


**4. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following pairs:**

    Reform/Act               Feature
    1. Cornwallis Reforms    :  Systematized recruitment and raised salaries
    2. Wellesley's Reforms    : Established the Fort William College
    3. Charter Act of 1853    : Introduced the Indian Civil Service
    4. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 :  Established simultaneous exams in India and Britain

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Cornwallis' reforms aimed to improve the efficiency and integrity of the civil service by introducing systematic recruitment procedures and raising salaries to reduce corruption.  Wellesley established the Fort William College for training civil servants, although it was later replaced by Haileybury College in England. The ICS existed well before the 1853 Charter Act; this act reformed the recruitment process through open competition.  The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did not establish simultaneous exams in India and Britain; the exams remained largely held in Britain. Option (b) is incorrect because the Charter Act of 1853 did not introduce the ICS; it reformed recruitment. Option (c) is incomplete; it doesn't include all correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because the Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did not establish simultaneous exams.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Governor-General/Viceroy     Significant Policy/Action
    1. Lord Dalhousie              :  Doctrine of Lapse
    2. Lord Curzon                  :  Partition of Bengal
    3. Lord Wellesley                : Subsidiary Alliance
    4. Lord Canning                 :  Policy of Subordinate Union with Princely States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Dalhousie is famously associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy used to annex several Indian states. Lord Wellesley implemented the Subsidiary Alliance system to expand British influence and control over Indian princely states. Lord Canning, after the 1857 revolt, adopted a policy of maintaining and working with the princely states in a subordinate role.  Lord Curzon is associated with the *curtailment* of the partition of Bengal, not its implementation.  Option (b) is incomplete; the question asks for all correctly matched pairs. Option (c) is incorrect because Lord Curzon is not associated with the given action. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Lord Curzon.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on polity and governance aspects of British rule in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                  Key Feature/Consequence
1. Regulating Act of 1773                  :   Established a Supreme Court in Bombay
2. Pitt's India Act of 1784                   :   Created the Board of Revenue
3. Charter Act of 1813                      :   Ended the Company's monopoly over Indian trade (except tea and China trade)
4. Charter Act of 1833                      :   Officially ended the East India Company's existence

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. The Charter Act of 1813 ended the East India Company's monopoly over most of the Indian trade, but it retained the monopoly of trade with China and the tea trade. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a Supreme Court in Calcutta, not Bombay.  Pitt's India Act of 1784 created the Board of Control, not the Board of Revenue. The Charter Act of 1833 did not end the East India Company's existence; it was the Government of India Act 1858 that effectively ended the Company's rule and transferred power to the Crown.  The other options incorrectly link Acts with features or consequences not associated with them, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the administrative history of British India.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                   Provision/Outcome
1. Cornwallis' reforms                       :   Established the Indian Forest Service
2. Charter Act of 1853                      :   Introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment
3. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861          :   Mandated examinations to be held simultaneously in India and Britain
4. Government of India Act 1935            :   Completely ended British control over the ICS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The Charter Act of 1853 did indeed end the Company's patronage system and introduced open competitive examinations for the ICS, although these were initially held only in England.  Cornwallis' reforms focused on improving the efficiency and integrity of the civil service, but did not establish the Indian Forest Service (that came later). The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did not mandate simultaneous examinations in India and Britain; this was a long-standing demand of Indian nationalists. The Government of India Act 1935 did not completely end British control over the ICS; the process of Indianisation continued even after 1935, but key positions remained under British influence for many years. The incorrect options test recall of specific details and understanding of the gradual and incomplete nature of ICS Indianisation.



**3. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                         Key Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement                  :   Applied primarily to the Deccan region
2. Ryotwari System                         :   Revenue collected directly from individual cultivators
3. Mahalwari System                        :   Revenue fixed permanently for a long period (e.g., 30 years)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Ryotwari system was characterized by direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries. The Mahalwari system involved periodic revisions of revenue but was often settled for a significant period, like 30 years. The Permanent Settlement was primarily implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa, not the Deccan.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of different revenue systems and their geographical application, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Governor-General/Viceroy           Significant Policy/Action
1. Lord Cornwallis                      :  Introduction of the Ryotwari System
2. Lord Dalhousie                       :  Implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse
3. Lord Wellesley                        :  Abolition of the Dual System of Government in Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. Lord Dalhousie is famously associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy of annexation. Lord Wellesley's policies led to the effective end of the Dual System of Government in Bengal, although the formal structures might have persisted for a while. Lord Cornwallis is known for the Permanent Settlement, not the Ryotwari System. The question tests the candidate's ability to connect key figures with their specific actions and policies during the British Raj.


**5. With reference to the British policy towards princely states, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Event                                    Characteristic
1. Subsidiary Alliance System                   :   Princes retained full control over internal affairs
2. Doctrine of Lapse                            :   Annexation of states without natural heirs
3. Assumption of the title of Empress of India by Queen Victoria  :   Strengthened British paramountcy over princely states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Doctrine of Lapse was used to annex states that lacked a direct male heir. Queen Victoria's assumption of the title of Empress of India symbolized the consolidation of British paramountcy over the princely states. The Subsidiary Alliance system, however, involved the loss of military independence and significant influence over internal affairs for the princely states; they did not retain full control.  The question tests understanding of the complexities of British policy towards princely states, requiring a nuanced understanding of the various systems and their impacts.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the political and administrative aspects of 18th and 19th-century India, with an emphasis on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Treaty                     Outcome
1. Treaty of Salbai           :   British gained control over Bengal
2. Treaty of Bassein          :   Peshwa became a British subsidiary ally
3. Treaty of Allahabad        :   Confirmed Mughal Emperor's authority in Awadh
4. Treaty of Seringapatam     :   Tipu Sultan ceded half his territories


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Treaty of Salbai (1782) ended the First Anglo-Maratha War with a status quo ante bellum, meaning neither side gained significant territory.  The British did not gain control over Bengal at this point; that occurred much earlier.  The Treaty of Bassein (1802) brought the Peshwa under British subsidiary alliance, significantly weakening the Maratha Confederacy. The Treaty of Allahabad (1765) did *not* confirm the Mughal Emperor's authority in Awadh; instead, it significantly reduced Mughal influence in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, granting the Diwani to the British East India Company. The Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) following the Second Anglo-Mysore War, resulted in Tipu Sultan ceding half his territories to the British and their allies. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Subsidiary Alliance System, consider the following pairs:**

   Ruler/State                 Specific Consequence of the Alliance
1.  Nizam of Hyderabad        :   Ceded territories in lieu of cash payments
2.  Nawab of Awadh            :   Retained full control over internal administration
3.  Tipu Sultan of Mysore     :   Entered into a subsidiary alliance willingly
4.  Peshwa Baji Rao II         :   Signed the treaty after a major military defeat by Holkar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Nizam of Hyderabad, under pressure, ultimately ceded territories to the British East India Company instead of paying the high cost of the subsidiary force.  The Nawab of Awadh, while nominally retaining some internal control after the Subsidiary Alliance, was subjected to significant British interference and control. Tipu Sultan vehemently opposed the Subsidiary Alliance system and actively resisted British influence. Peshwa Baji Rao II signed the Treaty of Bassein (which included a subsidiary alliance) after his defeat by Yeshwant Rao Holkar, demonstrating the coercive nature of the system. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 accurately reflect the consequences of the Subsidiary Alliance System.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Anglo-Indian War          Primary Outcome/Consequence
1. First Anglo-Maratha War  :   Establishment of British paramountcy in India
2. Second Anglo-Maratha War :   Complete elimination of Maratha power
3. Third Anglo-Mysore War   :   Tipu Sultan's death and Mysore's subjugation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-1782) did not lead to the immediate establishment of British paramountcy; it ended inconclusively. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-1805) significantly weakened the Maratha Confederacy but did not completely eliminate their power; some Maratha states continued to exist as subsidiary allies. The Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-1792) resulted in Tipu Sultan's death and the significant reduction of Mysore's power under British control. Therefore, only pair 3 correctly reflects the immediate outcome of the respective war.


**4. With reference to 18th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                       Description
1.  Dastak                      :   A land document
2.  Dadni system               :   Primarily associated with revenue collection
3.  Siyar-ul-Mutakherin       :   Written by Ram Mohan Roy
4.  Convention of Wadgaon     :   English renounced all their conquests


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A dastak was a trade permit, not a land document. The Dadni system was a credit system primarily associated with textile production, not revenue collection.  Siyar-ul-Mutakherin was written by Ghulam Husain, not Ram Mohan Roy. The Convention of Wadgaon (1779) did indeed see the English renounce all their conquests during the First Anglo-Maratha War (though this was short-lived). Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                        Role/Association
1. Warren Hastings             :   Governor-General during the Third Anglo-Mysore War
2. Lord Cornwallis             :   Governor-General during the Second Anglo-Mysore War
3. Lord Wellesley              :   Introduced the Subsidiary Alliance System
4. Lord Dalhousie              :   Known for his aggressive annexation policy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Warren Hastings was Governor-General during the First Anglo-Mysore War and the Second Anglo-Mysore War, not the Third. Lord Cornwallis was Governor-General during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, not the Second.  Lord Wellesley is correctly associated with the Subsidiary Alliance System. Lord Dalhousie is accurately known for his aggressive annexation policy.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer                Associated Organization/Movement
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                 :   Arya Samaj
2. Jyotiba Phule                    :   Satya Shodhak Samaj
3. Karsondas Mulji                  :   Widow Remarriage Association

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Jyotiba Phule is correctly paired with the Satya Shodhak Samaj, an anti-caste movement he founded in Maharashtra.  Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent social reformer in Bombay, associated with associations for Zoroastrian reform and women's rights within the Parsi community, but not the Arya Samaj.  Karsondas Mulji, while a significant figure in the widow remarriage movement in Western India, did not lead the Widow Remarriage Association; Vishnu Shastri Pandit is more prominently associated with its founding in the 1850s. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the key figures and their respective social reform movements in 19th-century India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link reformers with organizations or movements they were not primarily associated with, highlighting potential misconceptions about the relationships between these historical figures.  The question's difficulty stems from the inclusion of plausible distractors, requiring precise knowledge of the social reform landscape of the period.


**2. With reference to 19th-century social reform in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Focus                     Prominent Advocate
1.  Widow Remarriage                 :   Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi)
2.  Girls’ Education                  :   Savitribai Phule
3.  Anti-Caste Movement              :   Vishnu Shastri Pandit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Savitribai Phule, along with her husband Jyotiba Phule, was a pioneer in establishing girls' schools in Pune, significantly contributing to women's education in Maharashtra.  While Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi) was a champion of social reform in Maharashtra, his primary focus was not specifically widow remarriage; he advocated for broader societal reforms based on rational principles. Vishnu Shastri Pandit was indeed involved in social reform, but he is more closely associated with the Widow Remarriage Association than with a broad anti-caste movement. Jyotiba Phule would be more accurately associated with a leading anti-caste movement.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between the specific areas of focus for various social reformers. The distractors in options (a), (c), and (d) present plausible but incorrect pairings, demanding precise knowledge of the contributions of each individual. The difficulty level is moderate to difficult, requiring specific knowledge of individuals and their work beyond general awareness of 19th-century social reform.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Legislation        Year of Enactment
1.  Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act   :   1872
2.  Age of Consent Act              :   1891
3.  Child Marriage Restraint Act   :   1929

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Age of Consent Act, addressing child marriage, was enacted in 1891, and the Child Marriage Restraint Act (Sarda Act) was passed in 1929.  The Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act was enacted in 1856, not 1872.  The question tests factual recall of important social reform legislation in India and their chronological order. The incorrect options (a), (c), and (d) include the wrongly matched Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act, creating plausible distractors that require precise knowledge of the enactment years.  The question is of moderate difficulty, demanding more than superficial knowledge of Indian social reform history.


**4. With reference to the 19th and early 20th centuries in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement       Primary Region of Influence
1.  Self-Respect Movement         :   Maharashtra
2.  Brahmo Samaj                 :   Bengal
3.  Arya Samaj                   :   Kerala

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Self-Respect Movement, primarily associated with E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar"), had its strongest influence in South India, particularly Tamil Nadu. The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, originated and had its greatest influence in Bengal. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, while having a pan-Indian presence, had a particularly strong influence in North India. The question assesses the geographical reach and impact of major social reform movements in India. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, requiring knowledge of the regional distribution of these movements for accurate matching. The difficulty level is moderate, testing knowledge that goes beyond broad generalizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Contribution to Social Reform
1.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar          :   Founded the Satya Prakash
2.  Savitribai Phule                       :   Pioneered girls' education in Maharashtra
3.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy                   :   Abolition of Sati

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Savitribai Phule, alongside her husband, played a crucial role in establishing schools for girls in Maharashtra. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's relentless campaign significantly contributed to the abolition of Sati in British India. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a key figure in advocating for widow remarriage and promoting women's education, but he did not found the Satya Prakash; Karsondas Mulji is associated with that publication.  The question tests factual recall of prominent individuals and their specific contributions to 19th-century social reform. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect information, demanding precise knowledge of each individual's role to identify the correct pairings. This makes the question difficult, demanding specific knowledge rather than general understanding.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement                      Leader
1. Brahmo Samaj                         :   Raja Rammohan Roy
2. Prarthana Samaj                      :   Dadabhai Naoroji
3. Arya Samaj                           :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
4. Aligarh Movement                    :   Sir Syed Ahmad Khan
5. Self-Respect Movement                :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Raja Rammohan Roy is unequivocally associated with the founding of the Brahmo Samaj, a pivotal religious and social reform movement in 19th-century Bengal.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati is the undisputed founder of the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement emphasizing a return to Vedic principles. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan spearheaded the Aligarh Movement, a significant reform movement within the Muslim community focused on modern education and social reform.  Option (a) accurately reflects these established historical facts.

Option (b) incorrectly pairs the Self-Respect Movement with Gopal Krishna Gokhale. While Gokhale was a prominent social reformer, the Self-Respect Movement was led by E.V. Ramaswami Naicker ("Periyar"). Option (c) repeats the correct pairings from option (a)  and thus is also incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the Self-Respect Movement. Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of the Arya Samaj.  These incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the leaders associated with these crucial reform movements. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the historical context of 19th-century Indian reform movements.


**2. With reference to 19th-century Indian social reform, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Focus                          Prominent Figure
1. Widow Remarriage                      :   Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
2.  Abolition of Sati                      :   Gopal Hari Deshmukh
3. Women's Education                     :   Jyotirao Phule
4. Untouchability Eradication             :   Dadabhai Naoroji
5.  Religious Rationalism                 :   Keshab Chandra Sen


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a pivotal role in the legalisation of widow remarriage in British India. Jyotirao Phule, along with his wife Savitribai, was a leading figure in promoting women's education, particularly among marginalized communities. Keshab Chandra Sen, although associated with the Brahmo Samaj, also contributed significantly to religious rationalism by advocating for a more reasoned and less ritualistic approach to Hinduism. Option (b) accurately reflects these contributions.

Option (a) incorrectly attributes the abolition of Sati to Gopal Hari Deshmukh; while he was a reformer, Raja Ram Mohan Roy is more strongly associated with this cause. Option (c)  repeats the correct pairings from option (b). Option (d) is incorrect by omitting the contributions of Phule and Sen. These incorrect pairings act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the specific contributions of various reformers, thus assessing factual recall and analytical skills. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the various social reform efforts and their key figures.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Key Goal
1.  Atmiya Sabha                          :   Promoting Monotheism
2.  Satyashodhak Samaj                   :   Upliftment of Tribals in Bihar
3.  Indian Reform Association             :   Promoting Widow Remarriage
4.  Servants of India Society              :   Training National Missionaries
5.  All India Depressed Classes Federation :   Fighting Caste Tyranny


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Atmiya Sabha, established by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, explicitly aimed at promoting monotheistic ideals within Hinduism. The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, focused on training individuals dedicated to national service.  B.R. Ambedkar's All India Depressed Classes Federation directly addressed the issue of caste tyranny and fought for the rights of marginalized communities.  Option (a) accurately captures these primary goals.

Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the All India Depressed Classes Federation. Option (c) incorrectly pairs the Indian Reform Association with widow remarriage; while this was a concern of many reform movements, this specific association is not directly linked to it. Option (d) is also incorrect by omitting the Servants of India Society.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings as distractors enhances the question's difficulty, testing both factual recall and the ability to discern the precise objectives of different organizations, assessing analytical and evaluative skills. The question necessitates a nuanced understanding of the diverse aims of various organizations within the reform movement.


**4. With reference to the growth of Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                  Impact
1. Partition of Bengal                    :   Rise of Militant Nationalism
2. Ilbert Bill Controversy                :   Heightened Hindu-Muslim Tensions
3. Morley-Minto Reforms                  :   Increased Indian Representation in Legislatures
4.  Rowlatt Act                           :   Gandhi's First Satyagraha Movement
5.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre             :   Strengthened the Non-Cooperation Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Partition of Bengal significantly fueled the growth of militant nationalism within the Indian National Congress. The Morley-Minto Reforms, while limited, did increase Indian representation in legislative councils. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre served as a major catalyst in strengthening the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Gandhi.  Option (a) accurately reflects these historical linkages.

Option (b) is incorrect because it includes the Rowlatt Act, which, while leading to widespread protests, wasn't directly Gandhi's *first* Satyagraha (Champaran Satyagraha was). Option (c) omits the impact of the Morley-Minto Reforms. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of the Ilbert Bill Controversy and Hindu-Muslim tensions; while the bill caused some tension, it wasn’t the primary driver of such tensions. The inclusion of such closely related but factually incorrect options tests the candidate's deeper understanding of the historical context and the nuances of the events, assessing both factual recall and analytical skills. The question demands a precise understanding of cause-and-effect relationships in the evolution of Indian nationalism.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader of 1857 Revolt                  Location
1.  Nana Sahib                             :  Bareilly
2.  Rani Lakshmibai                       :  Jhansi
3.  Kunwar Singh                           :  Lucknow
4.  Khan Bahadur Khan                     :  Kanpur
5.  Begum Hazrat Mahal                    :  Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only Rani Lakshmibai is correctly matched with her location of leadership during the 1857 Revolt.  Nana Sahib led the revolt in Kanpur, Kunwar Singh in Jagdishpur (Bihar), Khan Bahadur Khan in Bareilly, and Begum Hazrat Mahal in Lucknow. The other options incorrectly pair leaders with locations where they did not primarily operate.  Understanding the geographical distribution of leadership during the 1857 Revolt is crucial for analyzing the decentralized nature of the rebellion and the challenges faced in coordinating resistance against the British. The question tests factual recall of key figures and their associated locations, highlighting the decentralized nature of the 1857 revolt.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the leaders and their respective areas of operation during the revolt, making it a difficult question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Year
1.  First Afghan War                         :  1845-1849
2.  Crimean War                             :  1838-1842
3.  Annexation of Awadh                    :  1856
4.  Santhal Uprising                         :  1855-1856
5.  Mangal Pandey Incident                  :  1857


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Only the pairs relating to the Annexation of Awadh (1856), the Santhal Uprising (1855-56), and the Mangal Pandey incident (1857) are correctly matched. The First Afghan War occurred between 1839 and 1842, and the Crimean War between 1853 and 1856. The other options include these incorrectly matched dates, acting as effective distractors. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the chronology of significant events leading up to and including the 1857 Revolt.  Accurate chronological understanding is essential for analyzing the context and causes of the revolt. The inclusion of closely related but incorrect years acts as a significant distractor, increasing the difficulty level of the question.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                                 Association
1.  Bahadur Shah Zafar                     :  Leader of the Sepoy Mutiny in Kanpur
2.  Nana Sahib                              :  Adopted son of Baji Rao II
3.  Tantia Tope                             :  Close associate of Rani Lakshmibai
4.  Kunwar Singh                           :  Prominent leader from Bihar
5.  Bakht Khan                              :  General who led the Bareilly troops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only Nana Sahib (adopted son of Baji Rao II), Kunwar Singh (prominent leader from Bihar), and Bakht Khan (General who led Bareilly troops) are correctly paired with their respective associations. Bahadur Shah Zafar was the symbolic leader of the 1857 Revolt, primarily based in Delhi, not Kanpur. Tantia Tope was a close associate of Nana Sahib, not Rani Lakshmibai. The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the key players and their roles in the 1857 Revolt.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related figures and their roles within the broader context of the revolt.


**4. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                                 Significant Event
1.  Meerut                                 :  Beginning of the revolt
2.  Delhi                                  :  Bahadur Shah Zafar proclaimed Emperor
3.  Kanpur                                 :  Siege of the Residency
4.  Lucknow                                :  Massacre after the surrender of British forces
5.  Jhansi                                 :  Rani Lakshmibai's heroic defense


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are Meerut (beginning of the revolt), Delhi (Bahadur Shah Zafar proclaimed Emperor), and Jhansi (Rani Lakshmibai's heroic defense). The Siege of the Residency occurred in Lucknow, and the massacre after the surrender of British forces happened in Kanpur.  The incorrect pairings serve as plausible distractors, demanding precise knowledge of the events at various locations during the 1857 Revolt. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical spread and key events of the revolt. The ability to distinguish between similar events occurring in different locations is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the 1857 Revolt.


**5. With reference to post-1857 British policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                     Objective
1.  Assumption of Government by the Crown:  End Company rule
2.  Disbanding of Indian Artillery Units   :  Increase Indian representation in the army
3.  Queen's Proclamation                   :  Promise of religious freedom
4.  Indian Civil Service Act of 1861       :  Ensure equal opportunities for Indians in civil service
5.  Policy of Divide and Rule                :  Strengthen British control through communal divisions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are the assumption of government by the Crown (to end Company rule), the Queen's Proclamation (to promise religious freedom), and the policy of Divide and Rule (to strengthen British control through communal divisions). The disbanding of Indian artillery units aimed to reduce Indian influence in the army, not increase it.  The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861, while aiming at creating a more structured system, did not, in practice, provide equal opportunities for Indians. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect objectives as distractors makes this a challenging question.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of British policies implemented after the 1857 Revolt and their actual impact, rather than their stated intentions.  This requires critical analysis and evaluation of historical policies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement/Organization        Prominent Figure
1. Widow Remarriage Association, Maharashtra :  Vishnu Shastri Pundit
2. Satya Prakash (Gujarati Publication)       :  Karsondas Mulji
3. Servants of India Society                   :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale
4. Poona Girls' School                      :  Jyotiba Phule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vishnu Shastri Pundit's significant contribution lies in establishing the Widow Remarriage Association in Maharashtra during the 1850s, advocating for the rights of widows to remarry. Karsondas Mulji played a crucial role in promoting widow remarriage through his Gujarati publication, *Satya Prakash*, in 1852.  Jyotiba Phule, along with his wife, pioneered the establishment of a girls' school in Poona in 1851, a landmark initiative in women's education.  While Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent social reformer, his primary association is with the Servants of India Society, an organization dedicated to social and political reform, not directly linked to the other movements in the provided pairs.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include pair 3 or exclude pair 4, which are factually incorrect based on the provided information.  The question tests factual recall and analysis of social reform movements in 19th-century India, specifically focusing on the key figures associated with each movement.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Organization              Primary Goal
1. Prarthana Samaj                         : Upliftment of Backward Classes
2. Satyashodhak Samaj                     :  Religious Reform
3. Arya Samaj                              : Social Reform through Vedic principles
4. Ramakrishna Mission                    : Spiritual and social reform


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, primarily focused on social reform through a reinterpretation of Vedic principles, emphasizing monotheism and social equality. The Ramakrishna Mission, established by Swami Vivekananda, aimed at spiritual and social reform, combining spiritual teachings with practical social work.  The Prarthana Samaj, while involved in social reform, did not have the upliftment of backward classes as its primary goal; its focus was broader, encompassing social and religious reform. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, primarily aimed at social justice and the upliftment of the lower castes, not religious reform.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The incorrect options incorrectly attribute primary goals to the organizations, demonstrating a need for precise understanding of the goals of each social reform movement. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the diverse goals of 19th-century Indian social reform organizations.



**3.  With reference to 19th-century Indian social reform, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement/Organization             Key Advocate
1.  Brahmo Samaj                             :  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
2.  Arya Samaj                               :  Swami Dayanand Saraswati
3.  Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha (Parsis)      :  Dadabhai Naoroji
4.  Satyashodhak Samaj                      :  Jyotirao Phule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Swami Dayanand Saraswati was the founder and key advocate of the Arya Samaj, a reform movement that emphasized Vedic principles and social reform. Dadabhai Naoroji was one of the founders and prominent figures of the Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha, a Parsi religious reform association. Jyotirao Phule was the founder of the Satyashodhak Samaj, aiming to uplift the lower castes.  However, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's main association was with the Brahmo Samaj, but he was not its founder, and his contributions were more focused on social reforms like widow remarriage.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy is more closely associated with the founding and early development of the Brahmo Samaj.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies in associating key figures with the movements, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the individuals involved in different reform movements. This question tests factual recall and analysis of the leadership within various 19th-century Indian social reform movements.



**4. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Primary Focus
1. British India Association                     :  Promotion of Indian interests in the British Parliament
2. Landholders' Society, Bengal               :  Advancement of Indian education
3. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                      :  Critique of administrative and legislative measures
4. Madras Mahajan Sabha                         :  Reform of the Civil Service regulations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The British India Association, formed through a merger of earlier organizations, primarily focused on representing and promoting Indian interests before the British Parliament. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, under the guidance of Justice Ranade, played a critical role in critiquing administrative and legislative measures. The Madras Mahajan Sabha also engaged in similar activities, focusing on issues such as administrative and legislative reforms.   The Landholders’ Society, however, primarily focused on representing the interests of landlords in Bengal, not on the advancement of Indian education, although education might have been a secondary consideration.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The incorrect options misrepresent the primary focus of the organizations, underscoring the importance of accurate understanding of their roles in the early nationalist movement. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills regarding the objectives and activities of various organizations in the early stages of the Indian National Movement.



**5. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader of Revolt/Rebellion                 Region
1. Surendra Sai                               : Sambhalpur
2. Utirat Singh                              :  Ganjam
3. Kattabomman                               :  Lucknow
4. Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi                      :  Awadh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Surendra Sai was a prominent leader of the anti-British revolt in Sambhalpur. Utirat Singh led a rebellion in Ganjam.  However, Kattabomman's rebellion was primarily in the Tamil Nadu region, not Lucknow, and Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi's activities were mainly in the Awadh region, but his leadership was not directly linked to the 1857 revolt in the same way as the others listed.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The other options include mismatched pairs, demonstrating the necessity of precise knowledge of the regional context of the 1857 revolt. This question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the regional distribution of leadership during the Revolt of 1857.  It also highlights the complexity of the revolt, which was not uniformly led across regions.


**6. With reference to early 20th-century Indian politics, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Group/Party                     Prominent Leader
1. Swarajist Party                             :  Motilal Nehru
2. No-Changers                               :  Vallabhbhai Patel
3. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA)   :  Bhagat Singh
4.  Indian National Liberal Federation        :  C.R. Das


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Motilal Nehru was a prominent leader of the Swarajist Party, advocating for participation in legislative councils as a means of political struggle. Vallabhbhai Patel was a key figure among the No-Changers, who opposed council entry and focused on constructive work.  However, while Bhagat Singh was involved in revolutionary activities, his primary association was with the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a later iteration of the HRA. C.R. Das was a significant Swarajist leader, but the Indian National Liberal Federation was formed by others, notably Surendranath Banerjea, after the split within the Congress. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The other options inaccurately link leaders with political groups, demonstrating the need for accurate knowledge of the different factions and their key figures during this period. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various political groups and their leaders in the early 20th century, showcasing the complexities of the Indian national movement.


**7. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Development                           Year
1.  Launch of Non-Cooperation Movement       : 1922
2.  Nagpur Congress Session                    :  1920
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident                     :  1921
4. Gandhi's Arrest                             : 1920


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress in December 1920 formally endorsed the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The Chauri Chaura incident, which led to the withdrawal of the movement, occurred in February 1922. Gandhi's arrest following the Chauri Chaura incident took place in March 1922.  The Non-Cooperation Movement itself began in 1920. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) incorrectly places the Chauri Chaura incident in 1921, while options (b) and (c) contain further inaccuracies regarding the timing of the events. This question assesses factual recall and chronological understanding of key events within the Non-Cooperation Movement, requiring precise knowledge of the timeline. The close proximity of dates in the incorrect options makes this a challenging question.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement/Leader               Region
1. Self-Respect Movement                        :  Maharashtra
2. Akali Movement                               :  Punjab
3. Justice Party                                 :  Madras
4.  Satyashodhak Samaj                         : Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2,3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Akali Movement was a significant religious and political movement in Punjab, focused on the reform of Sikh gurudwaras. The Justice Party was a prominent political party in Madras Presidency, advocating for the interests of non-Brahmins.  The Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar"), was primarily active in Tamil Nadu and not Maharashtra. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, was a social reform movement in Maharashtra, not Gujarat. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options contain incorrect regional associations, showcasing the importance of precise geographical knowledge related to the social and political movements of this period. This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect social reform movements with their respective regions of operation, highlighting the regional variations in social and political dynamics in early 20th-century India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Action/Association
1. Lala Lajpat Rai           :   Deportation following Punjab riots in 1907
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak      :   6 years imprisonment in 1908
3. Aurobindo Ghose          :   Advocated passive resistance and Swadeshi
4. Krishna Kumar Mitra     :   Deportation in December 1908
5. Chidambaram Pillai       :   Imprisonment in Madras in 1908

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in Punjab's canal colonies.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested in 1908 and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Aurobindo Ghose is explicitly mentioned as advocating passive resistance alongside Swadeshi and Boycott.  Krishna Kumar Mitra's deportation is listed among those of nine Bengal leaders in December 1908. Finally, Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment in Madras during 1908 is also mentioned.  The options attempting to exclude some pairs are incorrect because the text clearly establishes the accuracy of all the provided pairings.  This question tests factual recall regarding key figures and events in the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The inclusion of multiple individuals and events makes it a challenging question, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific details.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure             Ideology/Position
1. Aurobindo Ghose           :   Advocated for Dominion Status
2. Jawaharlal Nehru           :   Described young Indians as "Tilakites" or "Extremists"
3. Bipin Chandra Pal         :   Retired from active politics, impacting the militant nationalist movement.
4. Dadabhai Naoroji           :   Declared "self-government" or Swaraj as the goal.
5. Gokhale                     :   Condemned the Partition of Bengal in 1905.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are accurately matched. Jawaharlal Nehru's observation on young Indians identifying with Tilak's extremism is directly quoted. Dadabhai Naoroji's declaration of "self-government" or Swaraj as the movement's goal is also explicitly stated.  Gokhale's condemnation of the Partition of Bengal during the 1905 Congress session is clearly mentioned in the text. However, Aurobindo Ghose is associated with advocating for complete independence, not Dominion Status.  While Bipin Chandra Pal's retirement impacted the movement, the text doesn't explicitly state he advocated for any specific ideology in this context. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they incorrectly include pairs 1 and/or 3, which are not accurately reflected in the text. This question tests the ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information related to prominent figures and their roles in the Indian nationalist movement, necessitating careful reading and analysis of the source material.


**3. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper/Publication      Ideology/Position
1. Yugantar                    :   Advocated for passive resistance
2. Sandhya                     :   Promoted revolutionary terrorism
3. Kal                          :   Published in Maharashtra and advocated revolutionary terrorism
4. India                        :   Published in Britain to promote Indian views
5. Amrita Bazar Patrika        :   Commented on Tilak's imprisonment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include pair 1, which is mismatched. While *Yugantar* is mentioned, it is linked to advocating for the use of force, not passive resistance.  The other four pairs are correctly matched.  *Sandhya* and *Kal* are identified as newspapers promoting revolutionary terrorism, with *Kal* specifically located in Maharashtra.  *India*, a journal published in Britain, is explicitly stated to have been used for propagating Indian viewpoints. The *Amrita Bazar Patrika*'s reaction to Tilak's imprisonment is also noted.  This question demands precise recall of specific newspapers and their stances, testing the candidate’s knowledge of the diverse approaches within the nationalist movement.  The inclusion of both mainstream and radical publications adds to the question's difficulty.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary terrorist movement in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Action/Association
1. Khudiram Bose              :   Assassination attempt on the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge
2. Prafulla Chaki             :   Bombing in Muzzaffarpur, shot himself
3. V.D. Savarkar               :   Organized the Abhinava Bharat
4. Bhagat Singh                :   Assassination of a British police officer in retaliation for Lala Lajpat Rai's injury
5. Shyamji Krishnavarma       :   Prominent leader in Europe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are accurately matched.  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's involvement in the Muzzaffarpur bombing, with Chaki's suicide, is detailed. V.D. Savarkar's founding of Abhinava Bharat is explicitly mentioned. Bhagat Singh's assassination of a police officer as retribution for Lala Lajpat Rai's injuries is described.  Shyamji Krishnavarma's leadership in London, along with Savarkar and Har Dayal, is also stated in the text.  The question tests knowledge of key figures and events in the revolutionary terrorist movement, requiring precise recall of individual actions and their contexts. The inclusion of multiple individuals and events increases the difficulty level, requiring a strong understanding of the subject.  Incorrect options fail to include all correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                Location
1.  Partition of Bengal           :   Delhi
2.  Surat Session of Congress   :   Surat
3.  Barisal Conference            :   Barisal
4.  Kakori Conspiracy Case       :   Kakori
5.  Meerut Conspiracy Case      :   Meerut

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include pair 1, which is wrongly matched. The Partition of Bengal did not occur in Delhi; it primarily affected Bengal.  The other four pairs are correctly matched.  The Surat Session of the Congress was indeed held in Surat, the Barisal Conference in Barisal, the Kakori Conspiracy Case in Kakori, and the Meerut Conspiracy Case in Meerut.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the geographical locations associated with important events in the Indian nationalist movement. The seemingly straightforward nature of the question serves as a subtle distractor, as the incorrect pairing of the Partition of Bengal with Delhi requires careful attention to detail.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolt/Movement                 Leader
1.  Kuki Revolt                     :  Mangal Pande
2.  Kuka Revolt                      :  Baba Ram Singh
3.  Pabna Revolt                    :  Tantia Tope
4.  Birsa Munda Revolt              :  Kunwar Singh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair, Kuka Revolt and Baba Ram Singh, is correctly matched.  Baba Ram Singh was a prominent leader of the Kuka movement, a significant socio-religious and political movement in 19th-century Punjab. The other pairings are incorrect. Mangal Pande was involved in the events leading up to the 1857 Revolt, but he wasn't a leader of the Kuki revolt. Tantia Tope was a key figure in the 1857 Revolt, primarily associated with Kanpur, not the Pabna revolt.  Kunwar Singh was a leader of the 1857 Revolt in Bihar, not the Birsa Munda revolt, which occurred later and was led by Birsa Munda himself.  These incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the leaders associated with various 19th-century revolts. The question effectively tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various movements and their leaders.


**2. With reference to 19th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                     Primary Focus
1. Act V of 1843                         :   Child Marriage
2. Native Marriage Act of 1872          :   Sati
3. General Service Enlistment Act of 1856:  Infanticide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. Act V of 1843 primarily addressed the issue of infanticide.  The Native Marriage Act of 1872 dealt with reforming Hindu marriage practices, not sati (which was abolished earlier). The General Service Enlistment Act of 1856 concerned the terms of service for sepoys in the British Indian Army, not infanticide.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options like sati and infanticide, linked to related but distinct legislation, creates effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to precisely recall the primary focus of each Act. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding legislative acts.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Movement Supported
1. Arya Samaj                        :   Kuka Movement
2. Brahmo Samaj                     :   Shuddhi Movement
3. Dev Samaj                         :   Wahabi Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Arya Samaj, while involved in various social reform movements, did not primarily support the Kuka Movement.  The Brahmo Samaj, focusing on religious reform, did not directly support the Shuddhi movement (which was associated with the Arya Samaj). The Dev Samaj, another reformist organization, had no direct association with the Wahabi Movement.  The question requires precise knowledge of the organizations and the movements they supported, testing factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different reformist and religious movements in 19th-century India.  The "None" option is crucial here, eliminating the temptation to select partially correct options.


**4. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                     Key Leader
1. Kanpur                          :   Begum Hazrat Mahal
2. Lucknow                         :   Nana Saheb
3. Jhansi                           :   Rani Lakshmibai
4. Bareilly                         :   Khan Bahadur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third and fourth pairs are correctly matched. Rani Lakshmibai led the revolt in Jhansi, and Khan Bahadur was a key leader in Bareilly. The other pairings are incorrect.  Nana Saheb was the prominent leader in Kanpur, not Begum Hazrat Mahal, who led the revolt in Lucknow. The deliberate mismatching of locations and leaders makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the leadership structure of the 1857 Revolt. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills in distinguishing between various locations and their associated leaders during the revolt.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Interpretation of 1857 Revolt        Historian
1. "Neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence" :  S.N. Sen
2. "First war of Indian independence"             :   R.C. Majumdar
3.  "Began as a fight for religion, ended as a war of independence": Tarachand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched.  S.N. Sen's interpretation of the 1857 Revolt is closer to the description in option 3. R.C. Majumdar famously argued that the revolt was "neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence,"  making option 1 incorrect.  The statement in option 2 is more accurately associated with V.D. Savarkar.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of varying historical interpretations of the 1857 Revolt, requiring recall of specific historians and their perspectives.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect attributions of quotes to historians creates a high-difficulty level, demanding precise knowledge of historical scholarship.


**6. With reference to the causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following pairs:**

   Cause Category                     Specific Cause
1. Economic                             :   Doctrine of Lapse
2. Political                            :   Greased Cartridges
3. Socio-Religious                     :   Heavy Taxation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Heavy taxation was a significant economic cause of the 1857 Revolt. The Doctrine of Lapse was a political cause, related to the annexation of Indian states. The greased cartridges, while sparking the immediate outbreak, were primarily a socio-religious cause due to their impact on the religious sensibilities of Hindu and Muslim sepoys.  The question tests the candidate's ability to categorize the causes of the 1857 Revolt into appropriate categories, demanding conceptual understanding and analytical skills.  The use of distractors that link causes to incorrect categories makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge of the revolt's root causes.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-1857 British Policy              Characteristic
1.  Divide and Rule                      :   Promoting Hindu-Muslim unity
2.  Paramountcy over Princely States    :   Respecting complete autonomy of princely states
3.  Emphasis on "Martial Races" in the Army:  Reducing the number of Indian soldiers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Post-1857, the British policy emphasized recruiting soldiers from "martial races," primarily to reduce the number of Indian soldiers in the army and increase the proportion of loyal troops.  The policy of "Divide and Rule" actively worked against Hindu-Muslim unity. Paramountcy over princely states involved significant interference in their internal affairs, not respecting complete autonomy. The question tests the candidate's understanding of post-1857 British policies and their characteristics, requiring factual recall and the ability to analyze the implications of these policies. The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, highlighting the complexities of British imperial strategy.


**8. With reference to British Revenue Policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                     Key Feature
1. Permanent Settlement              :   Direct assessment of individual cultivators
2. Ryotwari System                    :   Assessment based on village communities
3. Mahalwari System                   :   Fixed revenue demand for zamindars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Permanent Settlement involved a fixed revenue demand from zamindars. The Ryotwari System focused on direct assessment of individual cultivators, not village communities. The Mahalwari System involved assessment based on village communities, not individual farmers.  The question tests knowledge of the different British revenue systems and their key features.  The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge of the details of each system to identify the correct match.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the nuances of British revenue administration in India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material focusing on individuals and events, some questions are structured to test knowledge of associated figures rather than direct pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person Deportated     Year of Deportation
    1. Lala Lajpat Rai      : 1909
    2. Krishna Kumar Mitra : 1907
    3. Ajit Singh           : 1908
    4. Bal Gangadhar Tilak : 1906

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab canal colonies.  Krishna Kumar Mitra was among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s arrest and imprisonment occurred in 1908, not deportation. The key here is to carefully note the specific years of deportation, which are often subtle details missed in broader historical overviews.  Option (a) is incorrect due to the inaccurate year for Lajpat Rai's deportation. Option (c) is wrong because of the incorrect year for Tilak's action. Option (d) contains the correct pairings for Lajpat Rai and Mitra but an incorrect year for Ajit Singh.


**2. With reference to the Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Person     Description/Association
    1. Aurobindo Ghose : Advocated for complete boycott of British commerce and administration
    2. Yugantar         : Newspaper advocating revolutionary terrorism
    3. Abhinava Bharat   : Organization founded by V.D. Savarkar
    4. Khudiram Bose  : Involved in the Muzaffarpur bomb attack

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Aurobindo Ghose's advocacy for complete non-cooperation is a central tenet of his political philosophy during this period.  *Yugantar* was indeed a newspaper promoting revolutionary terrorism. V.D. Savarkar founded the *Abhinava Bharat*, a secret revolutionary society. Khudiram Bose's participation in the Muzaffarpur bomb attack is a well-documented event. This question tests factual recall of key figures and their actions within the context of the militant nationalist movement. Options (a), (b), and (c) each omit at least one correctly matched pair, demonstrating the need for comprehensive knowledge of the period.


**3. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following pairs:**

    INC President           Year of Presidency
    1. Dadabhai Naoroji     : 1906
    2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale : 1905
    3. Surendranath Banerjea : 1886

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Dadabhai Naoroji's presidency in 1906 is correctly matched.  While Gokhale and Banerjea were prominent leaders, they did not hold the INC presidency in the years indicated. This question tests precise factual recall regarding the leadership of the INC during its formative years.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for accurate knowledge to avoid being misled by plausible but incorrect information. The subtle differences in years make this a challenging question designed to discriminate between superficial and deep understanding.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Event              Impact/Consequence
    1. Morley-Minto Reforms: Increased elected members in Imperial and Provincial Councils
    2. Partition of Bengal   : Became a secondary issue to the question of India's freedom
    3. Rowlatt Act          : Led to widespread protests and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre
    4. Government of India Act 1935: Introduced provincial autonomy but retained Governor's special powers

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the historical consequences of the listed acts and events. The Morley-Minto Reforms did expand the Indian representation in the councils, albeit with limitations. The Bengal partition, initially a major point of contention, was overshadowed by the broader demand for complete independence. The Rowlatt Act ignited widespread protests culminating in the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy. The 1935 Act did grant provincial autonomy, but it crucially preserved significant powers for the Governors, limiting true self-rule. This question assesses the understanding of the long-term effects of significant political events and acts, demanding a nuanced grasp of their historical impact beyond simple factual recall.  Any option excluding a correctly matched pair would be incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement (1919-1922), consider the following pairs:**

    Leader/Organization         Role/Action
    1.  Mahatma Gandhi         : Returned the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal
    2.  Ali Brothers             : Advocated for Muslim resignation from the British Indian Army
    3.  Jamia Millia Islamia    : Established as a national Muslim university
    4.  Chauri Chaura Incident : Led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Three of the four pairs are correctly matched. Gandhi's return of the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal is a well-known symbol of his commitment to the movement. The Ali brothers' call for Muslim army resignations is a significant event. The establishment of Jamia Millia Islamia as a national Muslim university reflects the movement's impact on education. The Chauri Chaura incident, however, directly led to the *withdrawal*, not merely the *suspension*, of the movement by Gandhi.  This question tests recall of events and actions, requiring a precise understanding of the nuances of the movement's progression and the causes of its eventual end.  Options incorrectly assessing the number of correctly matched pairs would be incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person/Group                Association
    1.  Bhagat Singh               : Involved in the Central Legislative Assembly bomb incident
    2.  Chandra Shekhar Azad     : Leader of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
    3.  Surya Sen                  : Led the Chittagong Armoury raid
    4.  Jatin Das                 : Achieved martyrdom during a hunger strike

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Bhagat Singh's participation in the Central Assembly bombing is well-known. Chandra Shekhar Azad's leadership of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) is a key fact. Surya Sen's leadership of the Chittagong Armoury raid is a significant event in the revolutionary movement. Jatin Das's death during a hunger strike is a powerful symbol of resistance. This question tests knowledge of key figures and events in the revolutionary terrorist movement, demanding factual recall and an understanding of their roles. Options (a), (b), and (c) would be incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**7. With reference to the Simon Commission and the Nehru Report, consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Document            Characteristic
    1. Simon Commission        : Composed entirely of British members
    2. Nehru Report             : Recommended Dominion Status as the next immediate step
    3. All Parties Conference   : Successfully created a unified Indian constitution
    4.  Mohammed Ali Jinnah    : Proposed the "Fourteen Points" demanding separate electorates

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Simon Commission's composition exclusively of British members is a well-established fact. The Nehru Report did advocate for Dominion Status. Jinnah's "Fourteen Points" included demands for separate electorates. However, the All Parties Conference failed to produce a fully unified Indian constitution due to disagreements among various groups. This question tests understanding of the political dynamics leading up to the independence movement, requiring knowledge of key documents, their proposals, and the associated political figures. Options (b), (c), and (d) would be incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the All Parties Conference outcome.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual Satyagraha     Initiating Figure
    1.  Individual Satyagraha:  Vinoba Bhave
    2.  Delhi Chalo Movement :  Gandhi
    3.  Salt Satyagraha         :  Gandhi

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vinoba Bhave was the first to participate in the Individual Satyagraha launched by Gandhi. Gandhi himself initiated both the Salt Satyagraha and the broader concept behind the 'Delhi Chalo' movement, although the 'Delhi Chalo' movement wasn't a singular, formally named initiative as much as a general call to action. This question tests knowledge of the different phases of the Civil Disobedience movement and the individuals who spearheaded them.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the initiating figures of at least one of the movements.  The subtle difference between a named event and a general strategy makes this a challenging question.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Congress Session          Key Decision/Event
    1.  Haripura Session       : Subhas Chandra Bose elected President
    2.  Tripuri Session         :  Bose's resignation as President
    3.  Nagpur Session         :  Adoption of the Non-Cooperation Movement
    4.  Ramgarh Session        :  Declaration of complete independence as the Congress goal

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key events at the respective Congress sessions. The Haripura session saw Bose's election. The Tripuri session witnessed his resignation.  The Nagpur session formally adopted the Non-Cooperation resolution. The Ramgarh session declared complete independence as the Congress goal. This question demands precise knowledge of Congress sessions and their significant decisions, requiring accurate recall to avoid being misled by plausible but incorrect associations.  Any option omitting a correctly matched pair would be incorrect.


**10. With reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Idea                    Gandhi's Stance     Bose's Stance
    1.  Non-Violence                 :  Strong advocate   : Critical, saw limitations
    2.  Industrialisation             :  Skeptical, favored village industries :  Strongly supported, saw it as essential for progress
    3.  Form of Government           :  Idealized decentralized village republics : Favored initially democracy, later considered authoritarianism potentially necessary
    4.  Role of Women               :  Emphasized traditional roles within the home : Advocated for full equality and participation in all spheres

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the contrasting viewpoints of Gandhi and Bose on crucial policy matters.  Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence is well-known, while Bose saw its limitations in achieving complete independence.  Gandhi's preference for village industries contrasts with Bose's strong advocacy for industrialization. Their differing views on the ideal form of government and the roles of women are also clearly documented. This question requires a deep understanding of the ideological differences between two pivotal figures in the Indian independence movement, demanding analysis and evaluation of their respective political and economic philosophies.  Any option omitting a correctly matched pair would be incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Uprising/Rebellion                     Location/Region
1. Kol Uprising                          :   Chota Nagpur
2. Santhal Uprising                       :   Bhagalpur and Rajmahal
3. Rampa Uprising                         :   Maharashtra
4. Bhil Uprising                          :   Southern Assam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Kol Uprising of 1831 primarily took place in Chota Nagpur, now part of Jharkhand, against the British administration's policies that favored outsiders as money-lenders and landlords, leading to widespread suffering among the Kol tribes.  The Santhal Uprising of 1855 occurred in the region between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal, in present-day Bihar and West Bengal, due to economic grievances and exploitation by money-lenders and the British authorities.  The Santhals even attempted to establish their own independent government.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Rampa Uprising was not located in Maharashtra; it primarily occurred in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. Option (d) is incorrect as the Bhil uprisings occurred in various parts of central and western India, not specifically Southern Assam. Option (b) incorrectly attributes the Bhil Uprising to Southern Assam. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various tribal uprisings and their geographical locations, a crucial aspect of understanding India's history of resistance against colonial rule.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolt of 1857 Leader              Location
1. Nana Sahib                             :   Bareilly
2. Rani Lakshmibai                       :   Jhansi
3. Kunwar Singh                          :   Kanpur
4. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah                :   Lucknow

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Rani Lakshmibai was indeed the prominent leader of the 1857 revolt in Jhansi.  Her resistance against the British annexation of her state and her refusal to relinquish her adopted son's claim to the throne made her a symbol of the revolt. The other options are incorrect. Nana Sahib led the revolt in Kanpur, not Bareilly. Kunwar Singh was a key leader in Bihar, particularly around Arrah, not Kanpur. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah was a significant leader in Faizabad and Rohilkhand, not Lucknow. This question tests factual recall of key figures and their respective roles in the 1857 revolt, demonstrating an understanding of the decentralized nature of the rebellion and the diverse leadership involved.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as associating Nana Sahib with Bareilly, makes the question challenging and assesses the candidate's precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of Discontent                 Specific Example
1. Economic Exploitation               :   Greased Cartridges
2. Religious Concerns                  :   Annexation of Awadh
3. Political Grievances                 :   Dissolution of the Nawab's administration in Awadh
4. Military Grievances                  :   General Service Enlistment Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The dissolution of the Nawab's administration in Awadh following its annexation directly resulted in widespread unemployment and economic hardship for thousands of people who had been employed within the Nawab's administration. This is a clear example of a political grievance fueling the revolt.  The General Service Enlistment Act, requiring sepoys to serve anywhere, directly clashed with the religious beliefs and social customs of many Hindu and Muslim sepoys, contributing to military discontent.  The other options are incorrect.  The greased cartridges, while a significant trigger for the mutiny, were more of an immediate cause than a long-term cause of widespread discontent. The annexation of Awadh was a political action, not a direct religious concern in itself, although it heightened existing religious anxieties. This question assesses the ability to analyze the multifaceted causes of the 1857 revolt, distinguishing between immediate triggers and underlying long-term grievances, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of historical causality. The distractors test knowledge of the specific events and their categorization as economic, religious, political, or military grievances.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Role in the 1857 Revolt
1. Bakht Khan                             :   Leader of the revolt in Kanpur
2. Tantia Tope                             :   Military strategist for Nana Sahib
3. Begum Hazrat Mahal                     :   Leader of the revolt in Jhansi
4. Kunwar Singh                           :   Leader of the revolt in Bihar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Tantia Tope played a crucial military role in supporting Nana Sahib's leadership during the Kanpur uprising. His skillful guerrilla warfare tactics significantly prolonged the resistance against the British. Kunwar Singh, despite his advanced age, emerged as a prominent military leader in Bihar, organizing and leading the revolt in that region. The other options are incorrect. Bakht Khan was a key military leader in Delhi, not Kanpur. Begum Hazrat Mahal led the revolt in Lucknow, not Jhansi.  This question tests the ability to associate key figures with their specific roles and locations within the 1857 revolt, demonstrating a detailed understanding of the rebellion's diverse leadership and geographical spread.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings, such as associating Bakht Khan with Kanpur, increases the difficulty and necessitates precise knowledge of the historical figures and events.



**5. With reference to the immediate causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                     Impact
1. Introduction of Enfield Rifle          :   Enhanced religious disaffection among sepoys
2. Rumours of bone dust in atta          :   Widespread fear among the civilian population
3. Mutiny at Meerut                        :   Spread of the revolt to Delhi
4. Mangal Pandey's execution            :   Signaled brewing discontent among sepoys

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The introduction of the Enfield rifle, with its greased cartridges, directly fueled religious anxieties among Hindu and Muslim sepoys, leading to widespread disaffection. The mutiny at Meerut, with the release of imprisoned soldiers and the killing of officers, rapidly spread the revolt to Delhi. Mangal Pandey's execution, though a single incident, served as a potent symbol of simmering discontent within the sepoy ranks.  Option (a) is incorrect because while rumors about bone dust in atta circulated, their widespread impact on the civilian population is less well-documented compared to other factors.  The question tests the ability to identify and analyze the immediate triggers and events that escalated the 1857 revolt, distinguishing between direct causal links and more speculative interpretations of events, highlighting the importance of understanding the interplay between military discontent and broader societal anxieties.  The inclusion of the bone dust rumor as a distractor requires a precise understanding of the primary factors that ignited the revolt.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on socio-religious reform movements and British policies in India during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Note that the difficulty level is inherently subjective, but these questions aim for a 'difficult' level by incorporating nuanced details and plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement                Prominent Figure
1. Brahmo Samaj                     :   Akshay Kumar Dutt
2. Arya Samaj                        :   Pandita Ramabai Saraswati
3. Aligarh Movement                 :   Syed Ahmed Khan
4. Widow Remarriage Association   :   Karsandas Mulji

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Akshay Kumar Dutt was a prominent figure in the Brahmo Samaj, known for his rationalist views and advocacy against child marriage.  Pandita Ramabai Saraswati, a key figure in the Arya Samaj, worked tirelessly for women's education and social reform. Syed Ahmed Khan spearheaded the Aligarh Movement, aiming to reconcile Islamic teachings with modern thought.  Karsandas Mulji actively championed widow remarriage, contributing significantly to the social reform movement through his Gujarati publication, *Satya Prakash*. While other figures were associated with these movements, the pairs listed in option (c) represent the most prominent and directly linked figures to their respective movements. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is also incorrect as it includes only one correctly matched pair along with an incorrectly matched one. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair (Akshay Kumar Dutt's association with Brahmo Samaj is less prominent than others).


**2. With reference to 19th-century social reform in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation                          Key Advocate/Impact
1. Age of Consent Act, 1891           :   Raja Ram Mohan Roy
2. Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 :   Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
3. Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 :   B.M. Malabari
4. Regulation XVII, 1829 (Sati Abolition):  Karsandas Mulji

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856 was significantly championed by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who actively campaigned for its passage.  B.M. Malabari played a crucial role in advocating for the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, although the act itself came later. The abolition of Sati through Regulation XVII of 1829 was primarily associated with the efforts of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and the support of Governor-General William Bentinck. Karsandas Mulji's contributions focused on widow remarriage, not the abolition of Sati. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are accurately matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair (Raja Ram Mohan Roy's primary advocacy was not for the Age of Consent Act). Option (b) is incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair (Karsandas Mulji's main contribution was related to widow remarriage). Option (d) is also incorrect because, although pairs 2 and 3 are correct, pair 1 is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer                     Contribution Area
1. Jyotiba Phule                       :   Widow Remarriage in Bengal
2. Gopal Hari Deshmukh ('Lokahitawadi'):  Rationalist Social Reform in Maharashtra
3. Dadabhai Naoroji                     :   Parsi Law Reform
4. Veeresalingam                       :   Widow Remarriage in Madras Presidency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gopal Hari Deshmukh, writing under the pseudonym 'Lokahitawadi,' significantly contributed to rationalist social reform in Maharashtra. Dadabhai Naoroji's work encompassed Parsi law reform, advocating for women's rights and legal equality. Veeresalingam Pantulu championed widow remarriage in the Madras Presidency.  Jyotiba Phule's work focused on social reform in Maharashtra, including widow remarriage, but not primarily in Bengal.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of Veeresalingam and his contribution. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly links Jyotiba Phule to Bengal and excludes the correct contributions of Gopal Hari Deshmukh and Dadabhai Naoroji. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly includes an incorrect pairing (Jyotiba Phule and Widow Remarriage in Bengal).


**4. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                  Region of Major Activity
1. Rani Lakshmibai                         :   Bareilly
2. Kunwar Singh                           :   Jhansi
3. Maulvi Ahmadullah                      :   Faizabad
4. Khan Bahadur Khan                     :   Bihar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Rani Lakshmibai's primary area of activity during the 1857 Revolt was Jhansi. Kunwar Singh led the revolt in Bihar. Maulvi Ahmadullah played a significant role in the revolt centered around Faizabad. Khan Bahadur Khan's major contribution was in Bareilly. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it mismatches Rani Lakshmibai and Kunwar Singh with their regions of activity. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes only one correct pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it mismatches Khan Bahadur Khan with Bihar.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy/Act                  Primary Effect/Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement                :   Direct revenue collection from ryots
2. Ryotwari System                      :   Created a system of absentee landlordism
3. Mahalwari System                     :   Revenue assessment based on village communities
4. Vernacular Press Act, 1878          :   Increased freedom of the Indian-language press


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ryotwari System involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots), while the Mahalwari System assessed revenue based on village communities. The Permanent Settlement, while intended to grant land rights to zamindars, created a system of absentee landlordism over time. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to restrict, not increase, the freedom of the Indian-language press.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it attributes a feature of the Ryotwari System to the Permanent Settlement. Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes the correct matching for the Mahalwari System. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes increased press freedom to the Vernacular Press Act.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                       Title/Association
1. Vallabhbhai Patel           :   "Sardar"
2.  Govind Giri                 :   Lasodia Movement
3.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy         :   Swaraj proponent
4.  Swami Vivekananda          :   Author of Jnana Yoga


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The title "Sardar" was indeed given to Vallabhbhai Patel, primarily by the peasants of Gujarat for his leadership in their struggles.  Govind Giri is correctly associated with the Lasodia Movement, a significant social reform initiative among the Bhils. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, while a prominent social and religious reformer, is not primarily known for first using the term "Swaraj."  Although he advocated for reforms and self-rule in a broader sense, the term's popularization and association with complete independence came later with leaders like Tilak and Gandhi.  Swami Vivekananda is known for his interpretations and teachings on Vedanta, not for authoring a book titled "Jnana Yoga." While he addressed themes related to knowledge and wisdom in his teachings, "Jnana Yoga" as a specific book title is not accurately attributed to him.  The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. Option (a) misses the correct pairing of Govind Giri and the Lasodia Movement. Options (c) and (d) incorrectly include the mismatched pairs concerning Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda.



**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Key Figure
1.  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha       :   Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  East India Association         :   Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi)
3.  Bombay Presidency Association :   Justice Ranade
4.  Indian Association             :   Surendranath Banerjea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bombay Presidency Association and the Indian Association are correctly paired with Justice Ranade and Surendranath Banerjea, respectively.  Justice Ranade played a crucial role in the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, shaping its intellectual and reformist direction.  However, Dadabhai Naoroji is primarily associated with the establishment and leadership of the East India Association in London, while Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi) was a significant figure in Maharashtra's social and intellectual reform movements, but not directly linked to the organizational leadership of the Bombay Presidency Association or the East India Association. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Option (d) accurately identifies the two correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                     Prominent Leader
1.  Champaran Satyagraha           :   Jawaharlal Nehru
2.  Bardoli Satyagraha              :   Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
3.  Non-Cooperation Movement       :   Motilal Nehru
4.  Khilafat Movement               :   Muhammad Ali Jinnah


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bardoli Satyagraha was indeed led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, showcasing his organizational and leadership skills.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah, although not the sole leader, was a pivotal figure in the Khilafat Movement, representing the concerns of Indian Muslims.  The other options are incorrect due to mismatched pairings.  Champaran Satyagraha was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru, who played a significant role later in the movement.  While Motilal Nehru was a prominent Congress leader, he was not the primary leader of the Non-Cooperation Movement; Mahatma Gandhi played that pivotal role.   Option (b) is the only option that accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**4. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Publication                       Editor/Prominent Contributor
1.  Kesari                           :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2.  The Indian Sociologist           :   Shyamji Krishnavarma
3.  Yugantar                         :   Bipin Chandra Pal
4.  Bande Mataram                    :   Surendranath Banerjea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Shyamji Krishnavarma is correctly linked to *The Indian Sociologist*, a publication that played a crucial role in disseminating nationalist ideas among Indian students abroad.  *Yugantar*, a significant revolutionary journal, was indeed associated with the Anushilan Samiti and figures like Barindra Kumar Ghosh.  The other options are incorrect.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the editor of *Kesari*, not Gokhale, who was a prominent Moderate leader. While Surendranath Banerjea was a leading nationalist, *Bande Mataram* was edited by several individuals at different times, and its primary association is not with him alone. Option (c) correctly identifies the two accurately matched pairs.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                     Key Feature/Impact
1.  Rowlatt Act                       :   Curtailed freedom of speech
2.  Official Secrets Act              :   Restricted press freedom
3.  Indian Councils Act of 1909    :   Introduced separate electorates
4.  Indian Universities Act of 1904 :   Increased government control over universities



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Rowlatt Act is infamous for its restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, allowing for detention without trial. The Official Secrets Act further curtailed press freedom by limiting the publication of information deemed sensitive to the government. The Indian Councils Act of 1909, a key part of the Morley-Minto Reforms, introduced the controversial policy of separate electorates for Muslims, which had long-term consequences for Indian politics.  The Indian Universities Act of 1904 significantly increased government control over universities, aiming to curb what the British perceived as the breeding ground for political dissent.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as all four pairs accurately represent the acts and their key features or impacts.


**6. With reference to the events leading up to and including the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Decision                       Year
1.  Treaty of Sevres                  :   1922
2.  Nagpur Congress Session           :   1920
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident           :   1922
4.  Gandhi's announcement of Non-Cooperation   :   1919


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Nagpur Congress Session, where the Non-Cooperation movement was formally endorsed, took place in 1920. The Chauri Chaura incident, which led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, occurred in 1922.  Gandhi's initial announcement outlining the Non-Cooperation strategy happened in 1919, fueled by the prevailing political climate and the Khilafat issue. The Treaty of Sevres, which significantly impacted the Khilafat issue, was signed in 1920. Option (d) accurately reflects the correct years for these events. The other options contain incorrectly matched years. For example, Option (a) incorrectly dates the Treaty of Sevres as 1922. Option (b) incorrectly places Gandhi’s announcement of non-cooperation in 1919 and option (c) incorrectly dates the Treaty of Sevres as 1922.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Group/Organization     Prominent Figure
1.  Anushilan Samiti                  :   Rash Behari Bose
2.  Abhinav Bharat                    :   V.D. Savarkar
3.  Ghadr Party                        :   Lala Lajpat Rai
4.  Jugantar                           :   Bagha Jatin


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Rash Behari Bose was indeed a key figure in the Anushilan Samiti, a prominent revolutionary organization in Bengal. V.D. Savarkar was the central figure behind Abhinav Bharat, another significant revolutionary group in Maharashtra.  Bagha Jatin (Jatindranath Mukherjee) is correctly linked to the Jugantar group, a faction within the Anushilan Samiti.  The Ghadr Party, primarily composed of Punjabi migrants in North America, was not directly led by Lala Lajpat Rai, although he was a prominent figure in the broader Indian nationalist movement.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  The other options are incorrect due to the mismatched association of Lala Lajpat Rai with the Ghadr Party.


**8. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Reform               Specific Detail
1.  Increased elected members         :   Majority non-official elected members in Provincial Councils
2.  Separate electorates              :   Reserved seats for Muslims in excess of their population proportion
3.  Indirect elections                 :   Electoral colleges for provincial and central legislatures
4.  Executive Council appointment     :  Appointment of an Indian to the Viceroy’s Executive Council


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the provided pairs correctly reflect aspects of the Morley-Minto Reforms. The reforms did increase the number of elected members in both provincial and central legislative councils, although non-officials still remained a minority.  A key and controversial element of the reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, granting them reserved seats exceeding their population percentage. The elections were indirect, involving electoral colleges at various levels before reaching the provincial and central legislatures.  Finally, the reforms included the significant step of appointing an Indian to the Viceroy’s Executive Council. Option (c) is the only option that reflects this accurate matching of all features with their details.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question focuses on different aspects of socio-cultural reform movements in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement                  Founder/Key Leader
1. Brahmo Samaj                     :  Keshab Chandra Sen
2. Prarthana Samaj                  :  Atmaram Pandurang
3. Satyashodhak Samaj               :  Gopal Ganesh Agarkar
4. Arya Samaj                        :  Dayananda Saraswati
5. Dev Samaj                         :  Dadabhai Naoroji

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Brahmo Samaj, while initially founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, underwent significant development under Keshab Chandra Sen, leading to a branch known as the Brahmo Samaj of India. Atmaram Pandurang, along with assistance from Keshab Chandra Sen, founded the Prarthana Samaj. Dayananda Saraswati is correctly identified as the founder of the Arya Samaj.  However, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar was not the founder of the Satyashodhak Samaj; that distinction belongs to Jyotirao Phule.  Dadabhai Naoroji is also incorrectly paired with the Dev Samaj; its founder was Shiv Narayan Agnihotri.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to these mismatches.


**2. With reference to 19th-century socio-religious reform movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement                     Primary Focus
1. Young Bengal Movement       :  Widow Remarriage
2. Aligarh Movement             :  Modern Western Education for Muslims
3. Ramakrishna Mission          :  Promoting Inter-caste Marriages
4. Theosophical Society         :  Universal Brotherhood of Humanity
5.  Satyashodhak Samaj         : Abolition of Caste System


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Aligarh Movement, led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, primarily focused on introducing modern Western education to Indian Muslims. The Theosophical Society, with its emphasis on universal spirituality, strongly advocated for the universal brotherhood of humanity, transcending religious and social barriers. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, directly challenged the caste system, aiming for its complete abolition. The Young Bengal Movement, inspired by Henry Vivian Derozio, was more focused on radical intellectual and social reform, not specifically on widow remarriage, although they did advocate for women's rights. The Ramakrishna Mission, while promoting social harmony, did not prioritize inter-caste marriages as its central focus.  Therefore, only options 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer              Significant Contribution
1. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar  :  Founded the Bethune School
2. Gopal Hari Deshmukh        :  Advocated for Widow Remarriage
3. Dadabhai Naoroji             :  Led the Faraizi Movement
4. Raja Ram Mohan Roy          :  Campaigned against Sati
5. Savitribai Phule              :  Founded the Prarthana Samaj

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a crucial role in the establishment and development of the Bethune School, a pioneering institution for women's education. Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known as Lokahitawadi, actively championed the cause of widow remarriage in Maharashtra.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy's relentless campaign against the practice of Sati is well-documented.  However, Dadabhai Naoroji was not associated with the Faraizi Movement; and Savitribai Phule did not found the Prarthana Samaj.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 represent accurate pairings.


**4. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements of 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arya Samaj emphasized a return to the Vedic ideals.
2. The Brahmo Samaj advocated for the abolition of caste.
3. The Prarthana Samaj primarily focused on religious rituals.
4. The Aligarh Movement aimed to modernize Muslim education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, indeed stressed a return to the original Vedic scriptures, rejecting later accretions to Hindu religious practice. The Brahmo Samaj, though evolving, consistently challenged the rigidity of the caste system and advocated for social equality. The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, focused on modernizing Muslim education by incorporating Western scientific and liberal ideas.  However, the Prarthana Samaj's focus was broader than just religious rituals; it encompassed social reform and aimed at a more rational and ethical approach to religious practices. Thus only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Primary Goal
1. Servants of India Society       :  Promote social service and upliftment
2. Social Service League          :  Train national missionaries
3. Ramakrishna Mission            :  Promote Hindu-Muslim unity
4. Bharat Dharma Mahamandala    :  Defend orthodox Hinduism
5.  Satyashodhak Samaj          :  Promote education for all

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, aimed at training selfless workers for national service and social reform. The Bharat Dharma Mahamandala was explicitly formed to defend orthodox Hindu traditions against reformist movements. The Satyashodhak Samaj, established by Jyotirao Phule, prioritized education and social upliftment for the marginalized sections of society. The Social Service League focused on practical social work, and the Ramakrishna Mission's primary goal, while encompassing social harmony, wasn't specifically Hindu-Muslim unity. Thus, only options 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the period of militant nationalism and related political and administrative developments in India.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                    Association/Action
1. Lala Lajpat Rai           : Deportation following Punjab riots
2. Aurobindo Ghose         :  Advocated passive resistance
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak      :  Imprisoned for 6 years in 1908
4. Krishna Kumar Mitra     : Deportation in December 1908
5. Ajit Singh                :  Organized Abhinava Bharat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were indeed deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907. Aurobindo Ghose was a prominent figure advocating for passive resistance as a form of nationalist action.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's arrest and sentencing to six years' imprisonment in 1908 are well-documented historical events. Krishna Kumar Mitra's deportation alongside other Bengal leaders in December 1908 is also a confirmed historical fact.  However, Ajit Singh did not organize Abhinava Bharat; that was V.D. Savarkar.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) accurately reflects this. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, making them incorrect.


**2. With reference to early 20th-century Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Movement       Prominent Leader
1.  Militant Nationalism             :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2.  Swadeshi Movement               :  Dadabhai Naoroji
3.  Revolutionary Terrorism          :  Khudiram Bose
4.  Anti-Partition Agitation         :  Lord Curzon
5.  Morley-Minto Reforms            : John Morley


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Khudiram Bose was directly involved in the revolutionary terrorism of the era, participating in the Muzaffarpur bomb attack. John Morley, as Secretary of State for India, played a crucial role in formulating the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji was a significant figure in Indian nationalism, he is more closely associated with the earlier moderate phase than the Swadeshi Movement which was predominantly led by Extremists like Tilak, Aurobindo Ghosh, and Bipin Chandra Pal.  Similarly, Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent Moderate leader, not a leader of the militant nationalist movement. Lord Curzon was the viceroy who implemented the partition of Bengal, sparking the anti-partition agitation, but he wasn't a leader of the agitation itself.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Publication         Associated Figure
1.  Yugantar                        :  Advocated revolutionary terrorism
2.  Kesari                           :  Bal Gangadhar Tilak
3.  Abhinava Bharat                  :  Lala Lajpat Rai
4.  Indian National Congress (1907):  Surat Split
5.  Bande Mataram                   :  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The newspaper *Yugantar* openly advocated for revolutionary terrorism as a means to achieve independence.  *Kesari* was indeed Bal Gangadhar Tilak's prominent Marathi newspaper. The Surat split in the Indian National Congress in 1907 is a well-known historical event. *Bande Mataram*, a powerful nationalist song, was originally composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.  However, Abhinava Bharat was founded by V.D. Savarkar, not Lala Lajpat Rai. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair of Abhinava Bharat and Lala Lajpat Rai. Only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian political landscape, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                     Year
1.  Partition of Bengal            : 1906
2.  Surat Split of Congress        : 1908
3.  Trial of Bal Gangadhar Tilak  : 1909
4.  Morley-Minto Reforms          : 1910
5.  Shifting of Capital to Delhi   : 1911


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The partition of Bengal was implemented in 1905, not 1906.  The trial of Bal Gangadhar Tilak for sedition took place in 1908, not 1909, and the capital was shifted to Delhi in 1911. The Morley-Minto Reforms were enacted in 1909, not 1910. The Surat split happened in 1907. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 show the correct year. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly match at least one event with its year.  Only option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure              Known for/Associated with
1.  Lord Curzon                   :  Annulment of the Partition of Bengal
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji               :  Formulation of Morley-Minto Reforms
3.  Gokhale                         :  President of the Congress at the time of the Partition of Bengal
4.  Aurobindo Ghosh                :  Advocacy of complete independence
5.  Lord Minto                     :  Implementation of the Partition of Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale was indeed the President of the Indian National Congress when the partition of Bengal was announced. Aurobindo Ghosh was a strong advocate for complete independence for India.  Lord Minto, as Viceroy, was responsible for the implementation of the Partition of Bengal.  However, Lord Curzon, not Lord Minto, initiated the Partition, and the Partition was later annulled, not by Curzon, but by the succeeding government.  Dadabhai Naoroji was not involved in the formulation of the Morley-Minto reforms, which were primarily shaped by Lord Minto and John Morley.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolt/Uprising                     Location
1. Waghera Uprising                   :   Surat
2. Kol Mutiny of 1831                 :   Singhbhum
3. Kutch Rebellion                     :   Kutch
4. Santhal Uprising                    :   Bhagalpur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Waghera Uprising, while mentioned in the source content, does not have a definitively stated location.  However, the provided options suggest Baroda as an alternative, which is incorrect. The Kol Mutiny of 1831 took place in Singhbhum, as stated. The Kutch Rebellion's location is accurately reflected in the pair. The Santhal Uprising primarily occurred in the region between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal, making the fourth pair correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the location of the Waghera Uprising is uncertain, rendering pair 1 incorrectly matched. Option (b) is incorrect due to the uncertain location of the Waghera Uprising. Option (d) is incorrect because while pair 4 is correct, pair 1 is not. The question tests factual recall of the location of specific uprisings, which is crucial for understanding the regional dynamics of resistance against British rule in India.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge beyond commonly known major revolts, emphasizing a more nuanced understanding of the period.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement              Founder/Prominent Figure
1. Prarthana Samaj                    :   Atmaram Pandurang
2. Theosophical Society              :   Madame H.P. Blavatsky
3. Brahmo Samaj                       :   Raja Ram Mohan Roy
4. Arya Samaj                          :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Atmaram Pandurang was indeed a key figure in the establishment of the Prarthana Samaj, a reformist movement in Maharashtra. Madame H.P. Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society. Raja Ram Mohan Roy is correctly linked to the Brahmo Samaj, a significant religious and social reform movement. Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj.  Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pairs 2 and 4. Option (b) is also incorrect as it omits Swami Dayanand Saraswati's association with the Arya Samaj. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the Brahmo Samaj with Raja Ram Mohan Roy while omitting the correct pairing of the Arya Samaj and Swami Dayanand Saraswati. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the founders of various social and religious reform movements in 19th century India.  The inclusion of less prominent movements alongside well-known ones enhances the difficulty level and necessitates a deeper understanding of the reformist landscape of the time.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolt of 1857 Leader               Location of Primary Activity
1. Nana Saheb                         :   Lucknow
2. Rani Lakshmibai                     :   Jhansi
3. Begum Hazrat Mahal                 :   Kanpur
4. Kunwar Singh                       :   Bihar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rani Lakshmibai's primary role in the Revolt of 1857 was centered in Jhansi, making pair 2 correct. Kunwar Singh's leadership was primarily focused in Bihar, making pair 4 correct.  However, Nana Saheb's main area of activity was Kanpur, not Lucknow (pair 1 is incorrect), and Begum Hazrat Mahal led the revolt in Lucknow, not Kanpur (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (a) is incorrect because only Rani Lakshmibai and Kunwar Singh are correctly matched with their locations. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 3. Option (d) is incorrect as it mistakenly includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 3. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their respective geographical roles during the 1857 Revolt. The inclusion of less prominent leaders alongside well-known figures adds to the question's complexity.  The distractors test the ability to differentiate between the actions of various leaders and their geographic locations during the widespread rebellion.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-1857 Reform/Action            Implementing Authority/Body
1. Queen's Proclamation                :   Lord Dalhousie
2. Indian Councils Act of 1861         :   British Parliament
3. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861     :   Lord Canning
4. Army Reorganization                 :   The East India Company

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1861 was indeed passed by the British Parliament, making pair 2 correct.  However, the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 was issued by Lord Canning, not Lord Dalhousie (pair 1 is incorrect). The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 was also passed by the British Parliament, not Lord Canning (pair 3 is incorrect). The Army reorganization post-1857 was undertaken by the British Crown, not the East India Company (pair 4 is incorrect). Option (a) is incorrect because only the Indian Councils Act of 1861 is correctly paired. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 3. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 4. The question tests the understanding of the administrative and legislative responses to the 1857 Revolt, demanding specific knowledge of the enacting authorities behind key reforms and actions.  The distractors serve to test detailed knowledge of the post-1857 period and the transition of power from the East India Company to the British Crown.


**5. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                       Prominent Leader
1. Swadeshi Movement                   :   Lala Lajpat Rai
2. Partition of Bengal                   :   Lord Curzon
3. Non-Cooperation Movement           :   Motilal Nehru
4.  Ghadar Party                         :   Baba Gurmukh Singh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lord Curzon was directly responsible for the Partition of Bengal, making pair 2 correct.  Motilal Nehru was a key leader in the Non-Cooperation Movement, making pair 3 correct. Baba Gurmukh Singh was a prominent leader of the Ghadar Party, making pair 4 correct.  However, while Lala Lajpat Rai was involved in the Swadeshi movement,  it wasn't his sole leadership (pair 1 is incorrect; many others like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale also led it). Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits Motilal Nehru's association with the Non-Cooperation Movement. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key leaders associated with significant events and movements in the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement. The inclusion of both prominent and lesser-known figures adds to the question's difficulty. The distractors are designed to challenge superficial understanding and demand a more detailed knowledge of the period.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Detained/Imprisoned              Year
1. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh          :   1907
2. Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt :   1908
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                     :   1908
4. Chidambaram Pillai                      :   1907
5. Harisarvottam Rao                       :   1908

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states the years of deportation or imprisonment for Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh (1907), Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt (1908), and Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1908).  Chidambaram Pillai and Harisarvottam Rao's arrests are mentioned in the text, but the precise year (1908) is not explicitly stated for them, making options (c) and (d) incorrect. Option (a) is incomplete, as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively and accurately matched based on the provided information.  This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail within the provided text.  The use of closely related but incorrect years in options (c) and (d) serves as a significant distractor, testing the examinee's ability to differentiate between precise information and general knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group Advocating Passive Resistance    Ideology/Slogan
1. Aurobindo Ghose                             :   "to make the administration...impossible"
2. Militant Nationalists                         :   Swadeshi and Boycott
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                             :   "India was showing fight"
4. Bipin Chandra Pal                            :   Complete Independence
5.  The Yugantar                               : "Force must be stopped by force"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghose's precise statement regarding making administration impossible through non-cooperation is directly quoted in the text, establishing pair 1's accuracy. The text clearly links militant nationalists with Swadeshi and Boycott, confirming pair 2. Jawaharlal Nehru's observation about India actively resisting British rule is also present in the text, validating pair 3. However, Bipin Chandra Pal's advocacy for complete independence and the Yugantar's call for "Force must be stopped by force" are not explicitly linked in the way the other pairs are. Although these points might be inferred from the broader context, the direct connections are missing, making pairs 4 and 5 incorrect.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between explicitly stated facts and implied inferences.  The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the examinee's ability to critically evaluate the evidence provided.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                                     Year
1.  Attempt on the life of Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal :  1906
2.  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's bombing      :  1908
3.  Foundation of Abhinava Bharat                     :  1905
4.  The Barisal Conference                           :  1906
5.  The Chapekar brothers' assassination               :  1897

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the year of the attempt on the Lieutenant-Governor's life (1906), the Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki bombing (1908), the founding of Abhinava Bharat (1904), the Barisal Conference (1906), and the Chapekar brothers' assassination (1897). All the pairs are correctly matched according to the given information. This question tests factual recall of specific events and their chronological order.  The inclusion of all correctly matched pairs makes the question challenging, demanding precise knowledge of the timeline of events related to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India.  The examinee needs to accurately recall the year for each event to answer correctly.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Leader/Group                     Action/Stance
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                            :   Advocated 'self-government' or Swaraj
2. Gokhale                                    :   Condemned the Partition of Bengal in 1905
3. Moderate Nationalists                        :   Wanted to confine the movement to Bengal
4. Militant Nationalists                        :   Called for self-sacrifice
5.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909           :   Cancelled the Partition of Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states Dadabhai Naoroji's declaration of the goal of 'self-government', Gokhale's condemnation of the Partition, the Moderates' limited approach to the movement, and the Militant Nationalists' call for self-sacrifice. These pairs are all correctly matched.  The Morley-Minto Reforms, however, are incorrectly paired with the cancellation of the Partition. While the Partition was later cancelled in 1911, this action is not directly linked to the 1909 reforms.  This question tests the examinee's ability to differentiate between cause and effect and to accurately recall the actions and stances of different groups within the Indian nationalist movement.  The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect pair serves as a strong distractor, requiring careful analysis of the text.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Publication                       Location/Focus
1.  The Yugantar                               :   Bengal
2.  The Kal                                     :   Maharashtra
3.  Sandhya                                     :   Bengal
4.  Anushilan Samiti                            :   London
5.  Abhinava Bharat                             :   London

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly links *The Yugantar* and *Sandhya* to Bengal and *The Kal* to Maharashtra, making pairs 1, 2, and 3 correct.  The Anushilan Samiti and Abhinava Bharat, however, are incorrectly linked to London. While some revolutionary activities had connections abroad, these organizations are not explicitly mentioned as operating from London in the provided text. The question tests the examinee's ability to accurately recall the geographical locations and focuses of different organizations and publications within the context of the Indian revolutionary movement.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect locations serves as a significant distractor, demanding precise recall of details from the text.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the Maratha Empire's expansion and political dynamics during the 18th century.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Maratha Leader        Significant Action/Territory
    1. Balaji Vishwanath     :  Expulsion of Sidis from Janjira
    2. Baji Rao I             :  Conquest of Malwa
    3. Nana Saheb             :  Defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat
    4. Madhav Rao           :  Restored Maratha control over North India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, played a crucial role in expanding Maratha influence in the Deccan. His strategic alliances and military campaigns, including the one against the Sidis of Janjira, significantly strengthened the Maratha position.  Baji Rao I, his son, is remembered for his brilliant military strategies and expansionist policies. His conquests, especially the acquisition of Malwa, significantly enlarged the Maratha Empire's territories.  Madhav Rao,  another Peshwa, successfully reversed the decline of the Maratha Empire following the devastating defeat at Panipat. He reasserted Maratha control over significant parts of North India.  However, Nana Saheb, while expanding the empire, did not achieve a notable victory as such; it was his army that suffered a crushing defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat. This defeat significantly weakened the Maratha Empire. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Maratha Empire's administrative structure, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                     Meaning/Application
    1. Chauth                  :  A tax levied by the Marathas on Mughal provinces
    2. Sardeshmukhi           :  A share of the land revenue collected by Maratha sardars
    3. Saranjam                :  A type of revenue assignment given to Maratha sardars
    4. Watan                   :  Hereditary land grants given to Maratha officials


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Maratha Empire's administrative system involved various revenue-related terms. "Chauth" was a significant tax imposed on the Mughal provinces, allowing the Marathas to extract revenue without direct control. "Sardeshmukhi" represented a further share of the land revenue, adding to the Maratha's financial resources. "Saranjams" and "Watans" were types of land grants given to Maratha sardars and officials, respectively, securing their loyalty and enabling them to maintain their own armies. These grants, while strengthening the sardars, also contributed to the decentralization of power within the Maratha Empire. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting key elements of the Maratha administrative structure.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Maratha Leader        Military Strategy/Tactic
    1. Shivaji                 : Guerrilla warfare
    2. Baji Rao I             :  Conventional warfare
    3. Nana Saheb             :  Naval warfare
    4. Madhav Rao           :   Siege warfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Shivaji Maharaj is renowned for his mastery of guerrilla warfare, effectively utilizing the terrain and employing unconventional tactics to defeat larger, better-equipped armies.  While Baji Rao I is known for his military prowess, he is not primarily associated with a specific singular military strategy; he was a highly adaptable military leader. Nana Saheb's military campaigns are not particularly noted for naval strategies, and Madhav Rao’s military operations don't specifically highlight siege warfare as his primary method, though he may have employed it. Therefore, only the association of Shivaji with guerrilla warfare is definitively correct.


**4. With reference to the decline of the Maratha Empire, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                     Impact
    1. Decentralization of power:  Weakened central authority
    2. Internal conflicts among sardars:   Facilitated British intervention
    3. Defeat at Panipat       :   Loss of Northern territories
    4. Lack of administrative reforms:  Impeded effective governance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The decline of the Maratha Empire was a multifaceted process. The decentralization of power, resulting from the system of land grants to sardars, weakened the central authority and created internal conflicts. These internal conflicts, often involving rival sardars, further destabilized the empire and created opportunities for British intervention. The catastrophic defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat resulted in the loss of significant territories in Northern India, severely weakening the Maratha military and political influence.  Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive administrative reforms hindered the empire's ability to govern effectively and maintain its vast territories.  Therefore, all four pairs accurately reflect factors that contributed to the decline of the Maratha Empire.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on social reform movements and key figures in 19th and early 20th century India.


**1. With reference to 19th-century Indian social reform, consider the following pairs:**

   Reformer/Organization                Focus Area
1.  Satyashodhak Samaj                 :   Widow remarriage advocacy
2.  Rahnumai Mazdayasnan Sabha       :   Zoroastrian religious reform
3.  Servants of India Society           :   Dalit upliftment
4.  All India Women's Conference        :  Promotion of women's education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, primarily focused on challenging caste discrimination and advocating for the rights of lower castes, including widow remarriage as a means of social upliftment.  The Rahnumai Mazdayasnan Sabha was a Parsi reform organization that aimed to modernize Zoroastrian religious practices and social customs, including improving women's status. The All India Women's Conference played a crucial role in promoting women's education and rights. The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, focused on broader national development and social reform, but Dalit upliftment wasn't its primary focus, although it certainly addressed social inequalities.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the social reform movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer                     Key Reform Effort
1.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar          :   Founded the Widow Remarriage Association
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji                    :   Promoted women's education within the Parsi community
3.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy                 :   Established the Atmiya Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a pivotal role in advocating for and ultimately achieving the legalisation of widow remarriage through the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, but he didn't found the association itself.  Dadabhai Naoroji, while a prominent social reformer, was particularly active in promoting women's education and rights within the Parsi community. Raja Ram Mohan Roy did establish the Atmiya Sabha as a precursor to the Brahmo Samaj. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair, and option (d) incorrectly includes pair 1. Option (c) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair 3.


**3. With reference to women's education and social reform in 19th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Organization               Contribution
1.  Savitribai Phule                    :   Established the first girls' school in Pune
2.  Pandita Ramabai                     :   Founded the Arya Mahila Samaj
3.  J.E.D. Bethune                      :   Founded the Alexandra Society for Parsi girls

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Savitribai Phule, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule, is credited with establishing one of the earliest schools for girls in Pune, a significant step in challenging societal norms. Pandita Ramabai founded the Arya Mahila Samaj, dedicated to women's education and welfare. J.E.D. Bethune is known for his significant contributions to women's education, particularly through the establishment of the Bethune School in Calcutta, not the Alexandra Society. The Alexandra Society was indeed involved with Parsi girls' education, but it wasn't founded by Bethune.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correct pairings or include the incorrect pairing of J.E.D. Bethune with the Alexandra Society.


**4. With reference to religious reform movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Organization             Primary Goal
1.  Arya Samaj                         :   Reconciliation of Islam with modern science
2.  Brahmo Samaj                       :   Monotheistic worship and Vedic reform
3.  Aligarh Movement                  :   Purification of Hindu practices through Vedic principles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, aimed to reform Hinduism by emphasizing monotheism, rationalism, and a rejection of idolatry and ritualistic practices, drawing inspiration from the Vedas and Upanishads. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati, focused on the purification of Hindu practices through a return to Vedic principles. The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, primarily aimed at reconciling Islamic teachings with modern science and promoting Western education among Muslims.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the primary goals of at least one movement.



**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Social Reformer                  Significant Contribution
1.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh ('Lokahitawadi'):  Founded the Prarthana Samaj
2.  Behramji M. Malabari              :   Advocated for the Age of Consent Act
3.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan               :  Established the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known as Lokahitawadi, was a prominent social reformer in Maharashtra who advocated for social and religious reform, but he did not found the Prarthana Samaj; it was founded by Atmaram Pandurang. Behramji M. Malabari played a crucial role in advocating for the Age of Consent Act, which raised the minimum age of marriage for girls. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan is well-known for establishing the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, a significant institution for promoting Western education among Muslims. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Leader/Prominent Figure
1.  Rowlatt Act Agitation                    :   Mahatma Gandhi
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre              :   General Dyer
3.  Partition of Bengal                     :   Lord Curzon
4.  Non-Cooperation Movement              :   Motilal Nehru
5.  Khilafat Movement                       :   Muhammad Ali Jinnah

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act agitation, which saw widespread protests and civil disobedience, was significantly shaped by Mahatma Gandhi's leadership. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a tragic event where British troops fired upon a peaceful gathering, was directly ordered by General Dyer. The controversial Partition of Bengal in 1905 was a key policy decision implemented under the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon.  Options 4 and 5 are incorrect. While Motilal Nehru was a prominent Congress leader during the Non-Cooperation Movement, it was Mahatma Gandhi who spearheaded the movement. Similarly, while Muhammad Ali Jinnah was involved in the Khilafat Movement, it was primarily led by the Ali brothers (Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali), Maulana Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan, and Hasrat Mohani.  The question tests factual recall of key figures associated with significant historical events in the Indian freedom struggle.  Distractors are included to challenge the examinee's knowledge of the nuances of leadership during these movements.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                         Key Characteristic/Outcome
1.  Surat Split                              :   Division between Moderates and Extremists within the Indian National Congress
2.  Lucknow Pact                            :   Agreement on separate electorates for Muslims
3.  Nehru Report                            :   Proposal for Dominion Status
4.  Simon Commission                       :   Boycotted by major Indian political parties
5.  Government of India Act 1935           :   Introduction of Provincial Autonomy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Surat Split of 1907 marked a significant division within the Indian National Congress between the moderate and extremist factions regarding the strategy for achieving independence.  The Lucknow Pact of 1916, while fostering Hindu-Muslim unity, did *not* initially include separate electorates; that was a later development. The Nehru Report of 1928 advocated for Dominion Status as the immediate goal for India. The Simon Commission, due to its all-British composition, was widely boycotted.  The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced significant constitutional changes, including provincial autonomy. The question tests the ability to recall and analyze key features of the Indian National Movement. Options are designed to be plausible distractors, requiring a thorough understanding of the events to select the correct answer.  The incorrect pairing (2) is a common misconception, highlighting the evolving nature of Hindu-Muslim relations during this period.


**3. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                  Implementation/Effect
1.  Divide and Rule                       :   Exacerbation of Hindu-Muslim tensions
2.  Permanent Settlement                    :   Creation of a class of powerful Zamindars
3.  Ryotwari System                        :   Direct revenue collection from individual cultivators
4.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878            :   Restriction on Indian-language newspapers
5.  Subordinate Union (Princely States)  :   Guaranteed territorial integrity of princely states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The British "Divide and Rule" policy actively fostered communal divisions, particularly between Hindus and Muslims, to weaken the nationalist movement. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming to streamline revenue collection, solidified the power of Zamindars. The Ryotwari System involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed restrictions on the Indian-language press to control the dissemination of nationalist ideas.  Option 5 is incorrect. While the policy of Subordinate Union aimed to maintain control over princely states, it did *not* guarantee their territorial integrity unconditionally; the British retained the right to intervene in their internal affairs. The question assesses conceptual understanding of British administrative and political strategies, demanding recall of specific policies and their consequences.  The incorrect pairing (5) highlights the complexities of British relations with princely states.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Association/Contribution
1.  Rabindranath Tagore                     :   Renounced Knighthood in protest against Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Authored "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India"
3.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                   :   Prominent leader of the Extremist faction in the Indian National Congress
4.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                     :   Advocated for Swaraj through constitutional means
5.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan                       :   Founded the Aligarh Muslim University


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Rabindranath Tagore's renunciation of his knighthood was a powerful protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, demonstrating his opposition to British brutality. Dadabhai Naoroji's seminal work, "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," provided a powerful economic critique of British rule. Sayyid Ahmad Khan played a pivotal role in establishing the Aligarh Muslim University, a significant institution for Muslim education. Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent leader of the *Moderate* faction, not the Extremist faction. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, while initially a moderate, later became a leading figure in the Extremist faction and advocated for Swaraj through *extra-constitutional* means, including mass movements and civil disobedience. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of prominent figures and their contributions to the Indian National Movement. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's nuanced understanding of the political landscape of the time.

   Event/Aspect                                 Characteristic/Outcome
1.  Chauri Chaura Incident                     :   Led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement
2.  Nagpur Session of the Congress, 1920       :   Formal adoption of the Non-Cooperation programme
3.  Khilafat Issue                             :   Provided a platform for Hindu-Muslim unity
4.  Boycott of Foreign Goods                   :   Significant reduction in the import of foreign cloth
5.  Establishment of National Educational Institutions :   Emergence of institutions like Jamia Millia Islamia



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence, led Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement to prevent its escalation into widespread violence. The Nagpur session of the Congress in 1920 formally endorsed the Non-Cooperation programme, marking a significant shift in the Congress's strategy. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliph, proved instrumental in fostering Hindu-Muslim unity during the movement. The boycott of foreign goods, especially cloth, had a tangible impact, reducing imports significantly. The movement also saw the establishment of numerous national educational institutions, including the Jamia Millia Islamia, as an alternative to government-run schools and colleges.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the Non-Cooperation Movement, requiring the candidate to recall multiple aspects and their interconnections.  All pairs are correctly matched, making this a challenging question that assesses comprehensive understanding of the movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult'.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                          Leader/Key Figure
1.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                   :  General Dyer
2.  Dandi March                                 :  Motilal Nehru
3.  Formation of the Khudai Khidmatgars      :  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan
4.  Abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey       :  Mustafa Kemal Pasha
5.  President of the Congress, Lahore Session 1929 :  Motilal Nehru


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was directly ordered by General Dyer.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," led the formation of the Khudai Khidmatgars (Servants of God), a Pashtun non-violent organization. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk abolished the Caliphate in Turkey in 1924.  Option (a) correctly identifies these three accurate pairings.

Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the Khudai Khidmatgars with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the correct pairing of the Caliphate abolition with Atatürk. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs Motilal Nehru with the Dandi March (it was Mahatma Gandhi) and with the Lahore Session Presidency (it was Jawaharlal Nehru). Option (d) is incorrect because while it correctly identifies the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and the Khudai Khidmatgars pairings, it mistakenly attributes the 1929 Lahore Session Presidency to Motilal Nehru instead of Jawaharlal Nehru.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Action Taken                                 Outcome/Consequence
1.  Boycott of foreign cloth                     :  Significant decrease in foreign cloth imports
2.  Resignation from government service        :  Widespread acceptance among government employees
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident                      :  Immediate suspension of the movement by Gandhi
4.  Nagpur Congress Session (1920)             :  Adoption of Purna Swaraj as the Congress goal
5.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                           :  Suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The boycott of foreign cloth during the Non-Cooperation Movement did lead to a notable reduction in imports. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence, directly prompted Gandhi to suspend the movement. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in a temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Option (b) accurately reflects these three linkages.

Option (a) is incomplete, missing the correct pairing related to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the outcome of the Chauri Chaura incident. Option (c) is incorrect as the Nagpur Congress session did not adopt Purna Swaraj (that happened later in Lahore).  Option (d) is incorrect because while it correctly identifies the Gandhi-Irwin pact outcome, it wrongly states that the Nagpur session adopted Purna Swaraj and that resignation from government service was widespread.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                         Association/Role
1.  Mangal Pandey                          :  Early spark of the 1857 Revolt
2.  Rani Lakshmibai                       :  Led the revolt in Jhansi
3.  Nana Sahib                             :  Led the revolt in Kanpur
4.  Bakht Khan                             :  Supreme Commander of the 1857 Revolt in Delhi
5.  Tantia Tope                             :  Close associate of Bahadur Shah Zafar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mangal Pandey's actions at Barrackpore are considered a precursor to the 1857 Revolt. Rani Lakshmibai played a crucial role in the 1857 revolt centered in Jhansi. Nana Sahib led the revolt in Kanpur. Option (a) accurately links these three individuals to their roles.

Option (b) is incorrect because Bakht Khan, while a significant leader, was not the supreme commander in the sense of having overall control of the entire 1857 revolt.  Option (c) is incorrect because it mistakenly separates Tantia Tope from his association with the revolt in Kanpur. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above regarding Bakht Khan and Tantia Tope's relationship with Bahadur Shah Zafar.


**4. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following pairs:**

   Region                                  Significant Event/Leader

3.  Jhansi                                   :  Led by Kunwar Singh
4.  Arrah (Bihar)                            :  Led by Rani Lakshmibai
5.  Faizabad                                 :  Prominent role of Maulvi Ahmadullah


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The revolt began in Meerut. The Siege of the Residency was a key event in Lucknow. Maulvi Ahmadullah played a significant role in Faizabad. Option (a) correctly identifies these three pairings.

Option (b) omits the significant role of Maulvi Ahmadullah in Faizabad. Option (c) incorrectly associates Kunwar Singh with Jhansi (he was in Bihar) and Rani Lakshmibai with Arrah (she was in Jhansi). Option (d) incorrectly links Rani Lakshmibai with Arrah.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Religious Reform Movement                Prominent Figure
1.  Brahmo Samaj                             :  Swami Vivekananda
2.  Prarthana Samaj                          :  R.G. Bhandarkar
3.  Arya Samaj                               :  Dayanand Saraswati
4.  Ramakrishna Mission                     :  Keshub Chunder Sen


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) Only 3
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

R.G. Bhandarkar was a prominent figure in the Prarthana Samaj. Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj. Option (a) accurately identifies these two correct pairings.

Option (b) incorrectly pairs Swami Vivekananda with the Brahmo Samaj (he was associated with Ramakrishna Mission). Option (c) is incomplete, omitting the correct pairing of R.G. Bhandarkar with the Prarthana Samaj. Option (d) is incorrect because it mismatches Swami Vivekananda with the Brahmo Samaj and Keshub Chunder Sen with the Ramakrishna Mission.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

**1. Consider the following statements:**

Statement I: The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 adversely affected the financial conditions of the sepoys.

Statement II: The sepoys had to pay higher taxes on the land where their family members stayed in Awadh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are individually true and contextually related. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie led to significant land revenue changes, directly impacting the sepoys' financial situation.  Many sepoys had family ties to Awadh, and the increased tax burden imposed by the British administration after annexation directly affected their financial stability.  Therefore, Statement II is a valid explanation of Statement I.  The economic hardship faced by the sepoys due to the annexation was a contributing factor to the 1857 rebellion.  The British policies of annexation and revenue extraction were major sources of discontent among the Indian population, including the sepoys.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Person                                        Association

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Madame HP Blavatsky, Col. H.S. Olcott, and Mrs. Annie Besant were all prominent figures associated with the Theosophical Society.  A.O. Hume is correctly paired with the Indian National Congress, as he played a crucial role in its founding.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect associations, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of historical figures and their affiliations. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between individuals and their respective contributions to different movements.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Person                                    Association

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Azimullah Khan was a key advisor to Nana Saheb during the 1857 rebellion. Tatya Tope, Rani Lakshmibai, and Kunwar Singh were all prominent leaders who played significant roles in the 1857 revolt.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their roles in a pivotal historical event.  The inclusion of all correct pairings requires thorough understanding of the 1857 rebellion's leadership. Incorrect options would involve mismatching individuals with events or leaders, demonstrating a lack of historical accuracy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribal Leader                             Title/Association
1. Jiriya Bhagat                          :   Dharti Aaba
2. Kanu Sanyal                           :   Revolutionary
3. Roop Nayak                            :   Tribal Leader
4. Birsa Munda                            :   Tribal Leader

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. Jiriya Bhagat is known as "Dharti Aaba" (Father of the Earth). While Kanu Sanyal, Roop Nayak, and Birsa Munda were all tribal leaders, they are not associated with the specific title "Dharti Aaba". This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific tribal leaders and their associations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings underscores the need for precise knowledge to answer the question correctly.  Incorrect options demonstrate a lack of specific knowledge about the tribal leaders.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Event                                         Location
1. Mangal Pandey Incident                   :   Barrackpore
2. Sepoy Mutiny of 1857                    :   Meerut
3. First War of Independence               :   Delhi
4. Sepoy Mutiny                             :   Various Locations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Mangal Pandey incident took place at Barrackpore, and the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 began in Meerut. While the First War of Independence (1857) involved multiple locations, Delhi became a significant center of the rebellion. The Sepoy Mutiny was spread across various locations.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) incorrectly associates Delhi as the sole location of the 1857 revolt.  This question tests knowledge of specific events and their locations, highlighting the importance of geographical context in understanding historical events.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Act                                          Subject
1. Sharda Act                              :   Prevention of Child Marriage
2. Widow Remarriage Act                     :   Widow Remarriage
3. Sati Abolition Act                       :   Abolition of Sati
4. Child Marriage Restraint Act            :   Prevention of Child Marriage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Sharda Act aimed at preventing child marriage, the Widow Remarriage Act legalized widow remarriage, and the Sati Abolition Act outlawed the practice of sati. The Child Marriage Restraint Act also targeted child marriage. This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific social reform legislation enacted during British rule. The inclusion of multiple correct pairs requires comprehensive knowledge of the relevant social reform acts.  Incorrect options would involve mismatching acts with their subject matter, showcasing a lack of understanding of social reform legislation.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Journalist                                 Publication/Association
1. W.H. Russel                           :   The Times (London)
2. Robert Peel                             :   British Prime Minister
3. Gladstone                              :   British Prime Minister
4. Palmerston                             :   British Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. W.H. Russel was a correspondent for *The Times* of London during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Robert Peel, Gladstone, and Palmerston were all British Prime Ministers, but this fact is irrelevant to the question's focus on journalism.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific journalists and their associations with publications, requiring detailed historical knowledge.  Incorrect options include prominent historical figures but fail to connect them accurately to the relevant journalistic context.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Historian(s)                                 Statement/Theory
1. R.C. Majumdar and S.N. Sen             :   Indian nationalism in the mid-19th century was in an embryonic stage
2. James Outram and W. Taylor             :   Colonial administrators
3. T.R. Holmes and L.E.R. Rees           :   Historians of 19th-century India
4. John Lawrence and Seale                :   Colonial administrators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. R.C. Majumdar and S.N. Sen, prominent historians, have articulated the view that Indian nationalism in the mid-19th century was in its nascent stages.  While James Outram, W. Taylor, John Lawrence, and Seale were colonial administrators, and T.R. Holmes and L.E.R. Rees were historians, these facts do not align with the specific statement about the embryonic stage of nationalism. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of historical interpretations and the ability to connect historians with their specific viewpoints. Incorrect options include plausible distractors that are related to the period but do not specifically support the statement.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Founder                                     Organization
1. Devendranath Tagore                     :   Brahmo Samaj
2. Keshav Chandra Sen                     :   Brahmo Samaj
3. Raja Ram Mohan Roy                     :   Brahmo Samaj
4. Rabindranath Tagore                    :   Visva-Bharati University

(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Devendranath Tagore, Keshav Chandra Sen, and Raja Ram Mohan Roy were all significantly associated with the Brahmo Samaj, though in different phases of its development.  Rabindranath Tagore founded Visva-Bharati University. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of the Brahmo Samaj and its key figures. Incorrect options include figures associated with other organizations or movements, highlighting the need for precise knowledge to identify the correct founders.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

Leader                                      1857 Revolt Location/Association
1. Fazil Mohammad Khan                   :   Bhopal
2. Sheikh Ramzan                          :   1857 Revolt
3. Dost Mohammad Khan                    :   1857 Revolt

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. Fazil Mohammad Khan was a leader from Bhopal who participated in the 1857 revolt. While Sheikh Ramzan, Dost Mohammad Khan, and Habibulla Khan were involved in the 1857 revolt, their specific location or association isn't explicitly linked to Bhopal in the provided context. This question assesses knowledge of regional leaders during the 1857 revolt. Incorrect options include figures involved in the revolt but lack the specific Bhopal connection, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of regional participation.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

Person                                      Quote/Statement
1. Sister Nivedita                         :   "The British empire is rotten to the core..."

(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The quote "The British empire is rotten to the core..." is attributed to Annie Besant. While Savitribai Phule, Annie Besant, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak were all significant figures in the Indian freedom struggle, their specific association with the given quote is incorrect. Only the pairing of Annie Besant with the quote is correct. This question tests the ability to link quotes to their authors, requiring precise knowledge of historical figures and their statements.  Incorrect options include notable figures but fail to connect them to the specific quote, emphasizing the need for accurate attribution.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

Person                                     Title/Honor
1. Raja Ram Mohan Roy                      :   Raja
2. Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Grand Old Man of India
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                  :   Leader of the Moderate Faction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was conferred the title of Raja, Dadabhai Naoroji was known as the "Grand Old Man of India," and Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Surendranath Banerjea were prominent leaders of the Moderate faction within the Indian National Congress. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of historical figures and their titles or associations.  All options are correctly matched, requiring comprehensive knowledge of prominent figures in the Indian National Movement.


**UPSC Style MCQs on Polity and Governance (based on Target Content):**

**13. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

Policy                                      Description
1. Divide and Rule                          :   Promoting religious and caste conflicts
2. Hostility towards educated Indians      :   Restricting Indian participation in administration
3.  Alliance with Zamindars                 :   Using landlords as a counterweight to nationalists

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of British administrative policies in India.  "Divide and Rule" involved exploiting existing social divisions for political advantage, including religious and caste conflicts.  The British were hostile towards educated Indians who challenged their authority and demanded greater Indian participation in administration.  They allied with Zamindars and landlords to counter the growing influence of nationalists.  Finally, the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of social services like education and healthcare is well-documented.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of British colonial policies and their impact on Indian society.


**14. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

Revenue System                           Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement                  :   Fixed revenue demand from Zamindars
2. Ryotwari System                         :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators
3. Mahalwari System                        :   Collective revenue assessment from villages
4. Hastings' System                         :   Revenue farming system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four revenue systems are correctly paired with their key characteristics. The Permanent Settlement involved a fixed revenue demand from Zamindars. The Ryotwari System involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators. The Mahalwari System involved collective revenue assessment from villages or groups of villages.  Hastings' System was a revenue farming system where revenue collection rights were given to contractors. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different British revenue systems and their implementation in India.  All pairs are correctly matched, requiring a thorough understanding of British revenue policies and their impacts.


**15. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

Policy                                      Characteristic
1. Non-interference in social life          :   Pre-1813 policy
2. Support for social reforms              :   Early British policy
3. Alliance with conservative elements    :   Post-1857 policy
4. Promotion of Western Education        :   Part of British policy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe aspects of British social and cultural policies. Before 1813, the British largely adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious life.  Initially, there was some support for social reforms, but this changed after 1857 when the British increasingly allied themselves with conservative elements in Indian society.  The promotion of Western education was a consistent feature of British policy, although its implementation and impact were complex and varied. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of British social and cultural policies in India and their complexities.


**16. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

Objective                                   Description
1. Protection of the Indian Empire       :   A primary aim of British foreign policy
2. Expansion of British commercial interests:   A major driver of British expansion
3. Containment of rival European powers :   A key aspect of British strategy
4.  Securing natural geographical frontiers:  A motive for territorial expansion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the objectives of British foreign policy in India. Protecting the vast Indian empire was paramount.  Expanding British commercial and economic interests fueled territorial expansion and control over resources.  Containing rival European powers, particularly Russia and France, was a crucial strategic goal.  The pursuit of natural geographical frontiers for defense and administrative cohesion also drove British expansion beyond India's traditional boundaries. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the goals and strategies of British foreign policy in the Indian context.  All pairs are correctly matched, requiring a broad understanding of British imperial interests and their geopolitical implications.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question focuses on different aspects of social reform and the early nationalist movement in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Social Reformer         Significant Contribution
    1. Jotiba Phule           :   Founded the Widow Remarriage Association
    2. Vishnu Shastri Pundit :   Started a girls’ school in Poona in 1851
    3. Karsondas Mulji        :   Advocated widow remarriage through Satya Prakash
    4. Gopal Hari Deshmukh  :   Known as ‘Lokahitawadi’

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known by the pen name ‘Lokahitawadi’, was a prominent social reformer in Maharashtra. Karsondas Mulji's contribution to the widow remarriage movement through his Gujarati publication, *Satya Prakash*, is well documented.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. Jotiba Phule and his wife Savitribai Phule are credited with starting one of the first girls' schools in Poona in 1851, not Vishnu Shastri Pundit.  While Vishnu Shastri Pundit was involved in social reform, he is primarily known for founding the Widow Remarriage Association in the 1850s, not Jotiba Phule. Option (a) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched.  Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Vishnu Shastri Pundit and the Poona girls' school. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes the founding of the Widow Remarriage Association and the Poona girls' school to the wrong individuals.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to distinguish between the contributions of different social reformers.


**2. With reference to 19th-century social reform in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Reform Movement         Prominent Figure
    1.  Zoroastrian Reform    :   Dadabhai Naoroji
    2.  Arya Samaj           :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
    3.  Brahmo Samaj         :   Raja Ram Mohan Roy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent figure in the Zoroastrian reform movement, advocating for women's rights and legal reforms within the Parsi community. Swami Dayanand Saraswati is the founder of the Arya Samaj, a reformist movement that emphasized Vedic teachings and social reform. Raja Ram Mohan Roy is widely recognized as the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, which advocated for monotheism and social reforms within Hinduism. This question assesses factual recall about key figures and movements in 19th-century Indian social reform.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the specific individuals associated with each movement, preventing easy guessing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization           Primary Goal
    1. British India Association :   Promote the class interests of Bengal landlords
    2. Landholders’ Society     :   Advocate for wider public interests in Bengal
    3. East India Association   :   Influence British public opinion on Indian issues


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The East India Association, founded by Dadabhai Naoroji in London, aimed to influence British public opinion and policymakers regarding Indian issues. The Landholders’ Society was indeed an early association, but its primary focus was on the interests of Bengal landlords, not wider public concerns. The British India Association, formed through a merger, aimed to protect and promote general public interests in Bengal, not solely those of landlords. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair, testing the candidate’s understanding of the specific objectives of these early Indian political organizations.


**4. With reference to pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization              Location
    1. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha :   Madras
    2. Madras Mahajan Sabha   :   Bombay
    3. Bombay Presidency Association : Calcutta

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was located in Poona (Pune), the Madras Mahajan Sabha was in Madras (Chennai), and the Bombay Presidency Association was in Bombay (Mumbai). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical locations of these important pre-Congress nationalist organizations, highlighting the importance of knowing the precise location of such entities. The use of plausible distractors increases the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                     Role in the 1857 Revolt
    1. Rani Lakshmibai         :   Led the revolt in Kanpur
    2. Nana Sahib               :   Led the revolt in Jhansi
    3. Tantia Tope              :   A key military leader under Nana Sahib

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Tantia Tope was a crucial military leader supporting Nana Sahib in the 1857 Revolt. Rani Lakshmibai led the revolt in Jhansi, not Kanpur, and Nana Sahib led the revolt in Kanpur, not Jhansi.  The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the leadership roles in the 1857 Revolt and requires precise knowledge of the individuals and their respective locations of activity.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, making the question challenging.


**1. With reference to the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Role/Association
1. Lala Lajpat Rai             :   Deportation following Punjab riots
2. Aurobindo Ghose           :   Advocated passive resistance
3. Bipin Chandra Pal          :   Leader of the Swadeshi movement
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru          :   Described young India's reaction to Tilak's conviction
5.  Krishna Kumar Mitra      :   Deportation in 1908

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were indeed deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907. Aurobindo Ghose was a prominent figure advocating passive resistance as a method of challenging British rule alongside Swadeshi and boycott. Bipin Chandra Pal, along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai (the Lal-Bal-Pal trio), were key leaders of the extremist faction within the Indian National Congress and actively participated in the Swadeshi movement. Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, directly witnessed and described the strong reaction of young Indians to Tilak's arrest and conviction, highlighting the rising unrest and nationalist sentiment. Finally, Krishna Kumar Mitra was among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908 for their nationalist activities.  Therefore, option (c) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these historically accurate pairings.


**2. With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                       Political Stance/Method
1. Dadabhai Naoroji            :   Advocated for 'self-government' or Swaraj
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak         :   Initially a moderate nationalist
3.  Gokhale                     :  Condemned the Partition of Bengal in 1905
4.  Surendranath Banerjea      :   Actively promoted Swadeshi
5.  Sayyid Ahmed Khan          :   Started an anti-Congress movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, explicitly declared the goal of Indian nationalism as 'self-government' or Swaraj. Gokhale, as President of the Congress in 1905, strongly condemned the Partition of Bengal. Surendranath Banerjea was a prominent leader who actively promoted the Swadeshi movement, urging the use of Indian goods and boycotting British products.  Sayyid Ahmed Khan, with the encouragement of British officials, initiated an anti-Congress movement to counter the growing nationalist sentiment. However, Bal Gangadhar Tilak is incorrectly paired in options (c) and (d) as he was not initially a moderate nationalist; he was a prominent figure in the extremist wing of the Congress from quite early on. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.  The inclusion of Tilak as a moderate is a significant distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the nuances within the nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the events surrounding the Partition of Bengal, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                        Key Figure/Organization
1.  National Council of Education     :   Aurobindo Ghose
2.  Raksha Bandhan Ceremony          :  Symbol of Bengali Unity
3.  Swadeshi Movement                 :   Primarily focused on rural areas
4.  Bande Mataram                     :   Became a national song of Bengal
5.  Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal      :   Target of an assassination attempt in 1906


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Council of Education was indeed established, and Aurobindo Ghose served as the principal of a national college. The Raksha Bandhan ceremony was effectively used as a symbol of the unbreakable unity of Bengalis across the partitioned regions. Bande Mataram quickly became a widely adopted national song of Bengal and later a theme song for the broader Indian nationalist movement.  An assassination attempt was made on the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in December 1906. However, the Swadeshi movement was predominantly an urban phenomenon, not primarily focused on rural areas as stated in option (c) and (d), making option (3) incorrect. Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies all the appropriate matches.  The inclusion of a factually incorrect statement about the Swadeshi movement's focus serves as a strong distractor.


**4.  With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement (1919-1922), consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Organization                    Action/Role
1.  Mahatma Gandhi                     :   Returned the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal
2.  Ali Brothers                          :   Leaders of the Khilafat Committee
3.  Swami Shraddhanand                 :   Preached from the Jama Masjid in Delhi
4.  Rowlatt Act                          :   Led to a countrywide hartal in April 1919
5.  Jamia Millia Islamia                 :   Established in 1920


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairings are accurate. Mahatma Gandhi's return of the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal symbolized his rejection of British rule and his commitment to the Non-Cooperation movement. The Ali brothers were indeed prominent leaders of the Khilafat Committee, spearheading the Muslim participation in the movement. Swami Shraddhanand, despite being a Hindu leader, was invited to preach at the Jama Masjid, demonstrating the extent of Hindu-Muslim unity.  The Rowlatt Act, with its repressive measures, directly triggered widespread protests including hartals across India. The Jamia Millia Islamia was established during this period as a response to the nationalist sentiment and the need for national educational institutions.  Therefore, option (c) is the only option that includes all the correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of the question and the inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a challenging question.


**5. With reference to the Second Non-Cooperation Movement and its aftermath, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                       Key Figure/Organization
1.  Bardoli Satyagraha                   :   Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
2.  Hindustan Republican Association  :   Bhagat Singh
3.  Swarajist Party                       :   Opposed Council entry
4.  Nehru Report                         :   Recommended Dominion Status
5.  Simon Commission                     :   Boycotted by the Congress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement, was successfully led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Bhagat Singh was associated with the Hindustan Republican Association, which later transformed into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. The Nehru Report, drafted by Motilal Nehru, did indeed recommend the attainment of Dominion Status as the next step for India. The Congress, along with other Indian parties, actively boycotted the Simon Commission due to its all-British composition. However, the Swarajist Party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, did *not* oppose council entry; it advocated for entering the councils to obstruct the government from within. This fact is crucial and serves as a key distractor. Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement about the Swarajist Party's stance on council entry makes this a difficult question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Demand          Specific Action/Policy Addressed
1.  Greater facilities for technical and higher education :  Expansion of educational infrastructure
2.  Development of agricultural banks  :   Reduction of land revenue
3.  Improvement of the police system   :   Separation of judicial and executive powers
4.  Defence of Indian workers abroad :   Advocacy for basic human rights in foreign countries
5.  Extension of medical and health facilities : Curtailment of powers of juries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The early nationalists advocated for a range of welfare and developmental measures.  Option (c) accurately reflects several of their key demands and associated actions.  They indeed pushed for improvements in technical and higher education, recognizing its importance for national progress.  Similarly, they championed the establishment of agricultural banks to alleviate the plight of peasants burdened by moneylenders. The defence of Indian workers facing oppression abroad, particularly in South Africa under Gandhi's leadership, was a significant aspect of their efforts.  However, the demand for an improved police system was linked to making it more efficient and popular, not directly to the separation of judicial and executive powers. While the nationalists certainly opposed the curtailment of jury powers, this was a separate concern related to civil liberties, not directly connected to police system reform. The extension of medical and health facilities was another clear goal of the early nationalists, aiming to improve public health and well-being. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones. Option (d), for instance, mistakenly links police system improvement to the separation of judicial and executive powers.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader             Key Focus/Demand
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji   :   Swarajya within the British Empire
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale :   Indianisation of higher administrative services
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak :   Boycott of British goods (Swadeshi)
4.  Surendranath Banerjea :  Separation of judicial and executive powers
5.  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi :   Reduction of land revenue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately reflects the key focus areas of several prominent early nationalist leaders. Dadabhai Naoroji, a pioneer of Indian nationalism, famously advocated for Swarajya (self-rule) within the framework of the British Empire, a gradualist approach to gaining greater autonomy.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a moderate leader, strongly pushed for the Indianisation of higher administrative services, aiming to increase Indian participation in governance. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a prominent figure in the rise of militant nationalism, championed the Swadeshi movement, which included a boycott of British goods to promote Indian industries. Surendranath Banerjea, another key leader, advocated for administrative reforms, including the separation of the judicial and executive branches for greater fairness and efficiency. While Gandhi's focus on land revenue reduction is associated with later phases of the nationalist movement, his early writings and activism also touched upon this issue, making it a justifiable inclusion. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Method of Early Moderates     Description
1.  Constitutional agitation :  Direct challenge to British authority
2.  Petitions :   Presenting popular demands to authorities
3.  Meetings :  Building strong public opinion in India
4.  Resolutions :   Educating British public opinion
5.  Speeches :  Slow, orderly political progress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The early nationalist Moderates primarily employed constitutional methods within the legal framework of British rule. Option (b) accurately reflects this approach. Petitions and public meetings were crucial tools for presenting their demands and garnering support.  Speeches played a vital role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing the population.  The goal was to achieve gradual, orderly progress through non-confrontational means.  However, constitutional agitation did *not* involve a direct challenge to British authority; it was precisely the opposite. Resolutions were primarily aimed at building Indian public opinion, although some efforts were made to influence British public opinion as well. Option (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs, like linking constitutional agitation to direct challenges or resolutions to educating British public opinion.


**4. With reference to the British Government's attitude towards the early nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   British Official       Characterisation of Nationalist Leaders
1.  Lord Curzon        :   "Disloyal Babus"
2.  Lord Dufferin       :  "Representing only a microscopic minority of the people"
3.  Lord Lytton         :   "Seditious Brahmins"
4.  A.O. Hume           :    "Violent Villains"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The British government's response to the early nationalist movement was marked by a mixture of suspicion, hostility, and attempts at co-option. Option (a) correctly identifies two instances of this attitude. Lord Dufferin's assessment of the Congress as representing only a small minority aimed to downplay its influence. Lord Curzon's actions and pronouncements reflected a clear hostility towards the nationalist movement.  However, the characterizations "Seditious Brahmins" and "Violent Villains" were more general terms used by British officials to discredit the nationalist leadership, not specifically attributed to Lytton or Hume.  A.O. Hume, despite his initial support, later became critical of the Congress' increasing assertiveness. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement's economic reforms, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Issue        Nationalist Demand
1.  Growing poverty      :  Rapid development of modern industries
2.  Drain of wealth to England :   Abolition of salt tax
3.  Destruction of indigenous industries :   Reduction of land revenue
4.  High taxation         :   Tariff protection for Indian industries
5.  Plight of plantation laborers :   Stopping the drain of wealth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The early nationalists were acutely aware of India's economic woes under British rule. Option (d) highlights several key concerns and their proposed remedies.  They rightly identified growing poverty as a major problem and advocated for the rapid development of modern industries to create employment and boost the economy. The "drain of wealth" to England was a constant criticism, and they demanded measures to stop this outflow of resources. The destruction of traditional Indian industries under British policies was another key concern, leading to demands for tariff protection. High taxation was seen as a significant burden on the Indian population, prompting calls for its reduction, including the abolition of the salt tax. The plight of plantation laborers was also a matter of concern, although the specific demands varied. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs or including incorrect matches.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  M.A. Ansari was a prominent Congress leader but never served as President of the Indian National Congress. Bhulabhai Desai, along with others mentioned in the text, advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections after the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).  S. Satyamurthy is incorrectly linked to opposing office acceptance in 1937; the text indicates that Nehru and others held this view. B.C. Roy is wrongly paired with advocating constructive work post-CDM; the text mentions this as one of three perspectives, not solely his advocacy.


**2. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Perspective                    Key Advocate/Characteristic
1.  Constructive Work            :   Subhas Chandra Bose
2.  Constitutional Struggle       :   Jawaharlal Nehru’s initial preference
3.  Resumption of Mass Struggle  :   Gandhi's primary approach after CDM

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Constructive work was associated with Gandhian thought, not primarily Subhas Chandra Bose, who favored more militant approaches.  The text clearly states that Nehru initially opposed both constructive work and council entry, advocating for the continuation of mass struggle.   Gandhi's approach after the CDM involved a two-stage debate, with an initial focus on non-mass struggle and later consideration of office acceptance;  the immediate resumption of mass struggle wasn't his primary approach.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                         Characteristic/Outcome
1. Government of India Act, 1935  :   Established Provincial Dyarchy
2. Third Round Table Conference    :   Congress participation
3. Patna AICC Meeting (May 1934) :   Formation of Parliamentary Board

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1935, established provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy.  The Third Round Table Conference notably lacked Congress participation. The Patna AICC meeting in May 1934 did lead to the establishment of a Parliamentary Board to contest elections under the Congress banner.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                         Description
1. Federal Level Executive         :   Governor-General acted solely on advice of ministers
2. Provincial Legislature           :   Indirect elections
3. Concurrent List                  :   Subjects on which both federal and provincial legislatures could legislate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correct.  Under the 1935 Act, the Governor-General had reserved and transferred subjects; he did not solely act on ministerial advice.  Provincial legislatures were characterized by direct elections, not indirect ones. The concurrent list accurately describes subjects under the joint legislative purview of both federal and provincial bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party                     Ideological Stance/Notable Member
1. Praja Socialist Party             :   Equidistance from Congress and Communists (Lohia's approach)
2. Swatantra Party                   :   Advocated close ties with the USA
3. Communist Party of India (Marxist) :   Supported peaceful, parliamentary means to achieve socialism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The Praja Socialist Party, particularly under Lohia's influence, maintained a position of equidistance from the Congress and Communists.  The Swatantra Party indeed favored closer relations with the United States.  The CPI(M) is incorrectly linked to peaceful, parliamentary means; the text highlights their belief in the need for an agrarian revolution and armed struggle.


**6. With reference to the Nehruvian era (1947-1964), consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Policy                     Characteristic/Outcome
1. First General Elections (1952)  :   Congress won a slim majority
2. States Reorganisation Act (1956):   Created 14 states and 6 Union Territories based solely on linguistic lines
3. Official Languages Act (1963)    :   Hindi became the sole official language from 1965

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are completely accurate. The 1952 elections resulted in a huge Congress majority, not a slim one.  The States Reorganisation Act, while creating 14 states and 6 Union Territories, did not base the reorganization solely on linguistic lines; other factors were considered. The Official Languages Act of 1963 did not make Hindi the sole official language; English retained an associate official language status.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-CDM Nationalist Perspective      Description
1. Gandhi's S-T-S Strategy              :   Continuous confrontation with imperialism
2. Nehru's S-V Strategy                  :   Mass struggle followed by truce, then another mass struggle
3. Nehru's Criticism of Council Entry    :   It would divert attention from anti-colonial struggle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Gandhi's S-T-S (Struggle-Truce-Struggle) strategy is accurately described. Nehru's S-V (Struggle-Victory) strategy is correctly described as advocating continuous confrontation.  Nehru's criticism of council entry is accurately reflected in the provided description.  Pair 2 is incorrect because it describes the S-T-S strategy, not Nehru's S-V strategy.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                        Known For
1. Usha Mehta                    :   Leading a contingent of the Indian National Army
2.  Lord Linlithgow                :   Viceroy during the Cripps Mission
3.  C. Rajagopalachari             :   Founder of the Swatantra Party


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Usha Mehta is known for running the Congress radio during the Quit India Movement, not leading an INA contingent. Lord Linlithgow was indeed the Viceroy during the Cripps Mission. C. Rajagopalachari was a prominent figure in the Swatantra Party but not its founder.


**9. With reference to the pre-independence era, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Movement            Prominent Figure
1.  East India Association           : Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha          :  Gopal Hari Deshmukh
3.  Indian Association, Calcutta    :  W.C. Bonnerjee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji was a key figure in the East India Association.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was associated with Justice Ranade and others, not Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitwadi) who was a prominent social reformer but not directly linked to this organization. W.C. Bonnerjee presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress, not the Indian Association, Calcutta, which was led by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy/Act                  Description/Impact
1.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878      :   Expanded freedom of the Indian press
2.  Permanent Settlement              :   Led to widespread subinfeudation
3.  Ryotwari System                  :   Revenue collected directly from individual cultivators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed restrictions on the Indian press, not expanding its freedom.  The Permanent Settlement did indeed lead to subinfeudation. The Ryotwari System correctly describes the direct collection of revenue from individual cultivators.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress took place in December 1928, where the Nehru Report was approved, and the demand for Purna Swaraj was debated.  The Lahore session in December 1929 is significant for the declaration of Purna Swaraj as the Congress's goal and the decision to launch the Civil Disobedience Movement. The Karachi session, held in March 1931, endorsed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and passed resolutions on fundamental rights and the national economic program. All three pairs are correctly matched with their respective years. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of significant Congress sessions and their chronological order, a key element in understanding the evolution of the Indian independence movement.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as potentially confusing similar years, makes this a difficult question, demanding precise knowledge.

Lord Irwin's declaration, promising dominion status for India, was made on October 31, 1929. The Delhi Manifesto, outlining conditions for attending the Round Table Conference, was issued on November 2, 1929. Gandhi's eleven demands, presented as an ultimatum to the British government, were issued in January 1930, preceding the Salt Satyagraha.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correct pairing. This question assesses factual recall of key events leading up to and during the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The close proximity of the events in terms of timing increases the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of the sequence of events.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

K. Kelappan, known for his role in the Vaikom Satyagraha, also led salt marches in Malabar (present-day Kerala). P. Krishna Pillai, a future founder of the Kerala communist movement, bravely defended the national flag during a police lathi-charge on Calicut beach.  All three pairs accurately reflect the roles of these individuals in the Civil Disobedience Movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct pairing. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of regional variations and prominent figures in the Civil Disobedience Movement, demonstrating an understanding of its widespread impact across India.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, proposed dominion status for India as the goal of the Indian National Congress. The Delhi Manifesto, issued in 1929, demanded that the Congress have majority representation at the Round Table Conferences. The Karachi Resolution, adopted in 1931, is notable for its inclusion of fundamental rights and a national economic program.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of these important documents. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correct pairing. This question requires an understanding of the evolution of nationalist demands and strategies, highlighting the shift from dominion status to complete independence and the articulation of socio-economic goals.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session                       Key Decision/Event
1. Calcutta Session (1928)                :  One-year ultimatum for Dominion Status
2. Lahore Session (1929)                 : Declaration of Purna Swaraj
3. Karachi Session (1931)                 : Endorsement of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 1928 Calcutta session gave the British government a one-year ultimatum to grant dominion status to India; otherwise, the Congress would launch a civil disobedience movement for complete independence.  The 1929 Lahore session formally declared Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the Congress's goal. The 1931 Karachi session endorsed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, marking a temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  All three pairs accurately link the Congress sessions with their significant decisions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while limited in its scope, introduced the principle of indirect elections to legislative councils, marking a step towards greater Indian participation in governance. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 further expanded elected Indian representation in councils, though still with limitations and safeguards for the British. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced provincial autonomy, a significant constitutional change granting greater self-governance to the provinces.  All three pairs accurately reflect significant aspects of these acts. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct pairing. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the gradual evolution of Indian political participation within the framework of British rule, demanding knowledge of key legislative acts and their impact.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual/Group                         Contribution to the Nationalist Movement

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist leader, authored the influential work "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," which articulated the "drain theory" of British economic exploitation. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a moderate nationalist, advocated for self-government in India modeled on the self-governing colonies of the British Empire. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a key figure in the rise of militant nationalism, championed passive resistance and the Swadeshi movement as methods of challenging British rule.  All three pairs accurately reflect the contributions of these individuals to the nationalist movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures in the Indian nationalist movement and their diverse approaches and contributions.  The inclusion of a range of prominent figures, encompassing both moderate and extremist viewpoints, makes the question more challenging.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Reform Movement/Organization           Prominent Leader
1. Brahmo Samaj                            :  Keshub Chandra Sen
2. Prarthana Samaj                          :  Mahadev Govind Ranade

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Keshub Chandra Sen was a prominent leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious reform movement that advocated monotheism and social reform. Mahadev Govind Ranade was a key figure in the Prarthana Samaj, a reform movement in Maharashtra that focused on social and religious reform within Hinduism. Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement that emphasized Vedic principles and social reform.  All three pairs correctly match the reform movement with its prominent leader. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correct pairing.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of 19th-century religious and social reform movements in India and their leaders, demonstrating an understanding of the socio-religious context of the nationalist movement.  The inclusion of three distinct reform movements makes the question more demanding, requiring specific knowledge of each.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Post-Civil Disobedience Movement Debate     Perspective/Leader
1.  Constructive work                       : Mahatma Gandhi

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, there was a debate within the Congress regarding the future strategy.  Mahatma Gandhi advocated for a period of constructive work focusing on social and economic reforms in villages.  Several Congress leaders, including M.A. Ansari, favored a constitutional struggle and participation in elections. Jawaharlal Nehru and a section of the Congress pushed for the resumption of mass struggle, arguing that constitutional methods were inadequate for achieving complete independence.  All three pairs correctly link the perspectives with their proponents. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correct pairing.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the internal debates within the Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, revealing the diverse viewpoints and the ideological fault lines within the movement.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Association                 Key Figure/Leader
1.  East India Association                  : Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  Indian Association                     : Surendranath Banerjea
3.  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                 : Mahadev Govind Ranade
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji played a crucial role in establishing the East India Association in London, which aimed to advocate for Indian interests in Britain.  Surendranath Banerjea was a prominent leader of the Indian Association in Calcutta, known for its advocacy of various reforms and its role in shaping nationalist sentiment in Bengal. Mahadev Govind Ranade was a key figure in the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, a significant organization in Maharashtra that focused on social and political reform.  All three pairs accurately link the organizations with their prominent leaders or founders. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correct pairing. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of important pre-Congress and early Congress-era organizations and their key leaders, demonstrating an understanding of the organizational development of the Indian nationalist movement.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy                     Associated Individual/Act
1. Permanent Settlement              :   Lord Cornwallis
2. Doctrine of Lapse                  :   Lord Dalhousie
3. Vernacular Press Act                :   Lord Lytton
4. Ilbert Bill                         :   Lord Curzon


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement, a landmark land revenue system in British India, was implemented by Lord Cornwallis in 1793.  This system granted zamindars (landlords) proprietary rights over their lands in exchange for a fixed revenue payment to the British.  Lord Dalhousie is correctly associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, a controversial policy that annexed Indian states lacking a direct male heir.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, however, was enacted under Lord Lytton, aimed at restricting the freedom of the Indian-language press.  The Ilbert Bill, which sought to grant Indian judges the power to try European offenders, was introduced by Lord Ripon, not Lord Curzon. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (c) and (d) incorrectly include the association of the Vernacular Press Act and the Ilbert Bill with the wrong individuals. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the specific land revenue systems and the context of press freedom and judicial reforms within the British Raj is crucial for correctly answering this question.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific historical events and their association with key figures in British Indian history.


**2. With reference to British economic policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                  Region of Implementation
1. Ryotwari System                 :   Bengal
2. Mahalwari System                :   Madras Presidency
3. Zamindari System                :   North-Western Provinces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Zamindari system, characterized by granting landlords (zamindars) proprietary rights over land, was primarily implemented in the North-Western Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and parts of Bengal. The Ryotwari system, which involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots), was mainly implemented in Madras Presidency (present-day Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala) and Bombay Presidency. The Mahalwari system, which collected revenue from village communities (mahals), was predominantly implemented in the North-Western Provinces, Central Provinces, and Punjab. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly associate revenue systems with regions where they were not primarily implemented, highlighting a common misunderstanding regarding the geographical distribution of these systems. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the intricacies of British land revenue policies and their regional variations in India.  It demands precise recall of the geographical reach of each revenue system which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the economic impact of British rule.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Governor-General/Viceroy           Significant Policy/Event
1. Lord Curzon                           :   Partition of Bengal
2. Lord Dalhousie                         :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System
3. Lord Wellesley                          :   Implementation of the Subsidiary Alliance System


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lord Curzon's tenure as Viceroy of India is indeed strongly associated with the controversial Partition of Bengal in 1905.  This divisive policy aimed to weaken Bengali nationalism. Lord Wellesley, during his governorship, actively pursued and implemented the Subsidiary Alliance System, a key strategy for expanding British influence and control over Indian princely states. This system involved forging alliances with Indian rulers in exchange for British military protection, but often resulted in the gradual erosion of their independence. However, the Ryotwari system, a crucial land revenue system, was not introduced by Lord Dalhousie.  While Dalhousie certainly implemented policies of annexation, the Ryotwari system had its origins earlier in the 18th century and was developed and expanded over time by different administrators. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect association of Lord Dalhousie with the Ryotwari system serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the nuances of British administrative policies. This question requires a strong understanding of the chronological aspects of British policies and their implementation, a crucial skill tested in the UPSC examination.


**4. With reference to the British administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                      Key Provision
1. Regulating Act of 1773                  :   Established a Governor-General for Bengal
2. Pitt's India Act of 1784                 :   Created a Board of Control to oversee the East India Company
3. Charter Act of 1813                     :   Ended the East India Company's trade monopoly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Regulating Act of 1773 is correctly paired with the establishment of a Governor-General for Bengal, marking a significant step towards centralizing the British administration in India.  Pitt's India Act of 1784 correctly established the Board of Control, a British government body designed to supervise the East India Company's activities and ensure greater accountability.  The Charter Act of 1813 is correctly associated with the end of the East India Company's monopoly on trade with India, opening up the market to other British merchants, which had a profound effect on the Indian economy. All three pairs are correctly matched. The options provide plausible distractors by separating the pairs, testing the examinee's ability to recall specific details about each Act and its associated changes in the British administration of India. This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the legislative framework governing British rule in India and its impact on the political and economic landscape.  The ability to accurately recall and connect key legislative acts with their specific provisions is a critical skill for UPSC aspirants.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Indian Official              Significant Action/Policy
1. Lord Metcalfe                         :   Imposed restrictions on the Indian press
2. Lord Lytton                           :   Enacted the Vernacular Press Act
3. Lord Ripon                            :   Introduced the Ilbert Bill


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lord Lytton is correctly linked to the Vernacular Press Act of 1878, a restrictive measure aimed at controlling the Indian-language press. Lord Ripon is accurately associated with the Ilbert Bill, a controversial attempt to grant Indian judges the authority to try European offenders, highlighting the complexities of racial relations within the British administration.  However, Lord Metcalfe is incorrectly paired with imposing restrictions on the press. In fact, he is known for liberalizing press regulations during his tenure. The inclusion of Metcalfe as a distractor tests the candidate’s knowledge of the nuances of press freedom and its evolution during the British period.  The question tests the ability to identify accurate associations between individuals and their specific policy actions, demanding a detailed understanding of the historical context. The correct answer highlights the complex interplay between British administrative policies and their impact on Indian society.  The inclusion of plausible incorrect pairs necessitates precise factual knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Prominent Leader(s)
1.  Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress (1920) :  Motilal Nehru
2.  Allahabad Conference (June 1920)     :  C.R. Das
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident (February 1922) :  Hakim Ajmal Khan
4.  Khilafat Committee Formation (early 1919) :  Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress in December 1920 is significant for the endorsement of the Non-Cooperation movement, and organizational changes within the Congress.  While Motilal Nehru was a prominent Congress leader, he wasn't the sole defining figure of the Nagpur session.  Gandhi's role in shaping the session's outcome and declaring the possibility of achieving Swaraj within a year is crucial. Similarly, C.R. Das was a prominent leader, but the Allahabad conference involved a broader range of figures approving a boycott program. The Chauri Chaura incident in February 1922 directly led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Gandhi. While Hakim Ajmal Khan was a key figure in the Khilafat movement, he was not the sole leader of the Khilafat Committee's formation. The Ali brothers played a more central role in its establishment.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the primary leadership associated with those specific events.  The other pairs contain either incorrect or incomplete information regarding the primary leadership involved.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                          Key Demand/Outcome
1.  Lucknow Pact (1916)                      :  Joint electorates for Hindus and Muslims
2.  Treaty of Sevres (May 1920)            :  Retention of Khalifa’s control over Muslim sacred places
3.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms (1918)   :  Introduction of Dyarchy
4.  Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) :  Establishment of Swaraj within a year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The Lucknow Pact of 1916 did result in a significant agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League, but the key outcome was not joint electorates.  Instead, it involved the acceptance of separate electorates by the Congress while establishing a joint platform for constitutional demands. The Treaty of Sevres (May 1920) significantly impacted the Khilafat issue, but its outcome was the dismemberment of Turkey and the removal of the Khalifa from power, directly contradicting the intended preservation of the Khalifa's control. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1918 did indeed introduce the system of dyarchy in India, aiming for a gradual devolution of power.  The Non-Cooperation Movement aimed for Swaraj, but achieving it within a year was Gandhi's ambitious prediction, not a guaranteed outcome; the movement was suspended before this could be realized. Therefore, only the pairs related to the Lucknow Pact and the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms accurately reflect the intended outcomes or actual results.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                 Role/Action
1.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :  President, All India Khilafat Committee
2.  C.R. Das                               :  Principal, Bengal National College
3.  Acharya Narendra Dev                   :  Led boycott of government schools and colleges
4.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                     :  Supported the movement initially


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's role as President of the All India Khilafat Committee is well-documented, making this a correct pairing.  C.R. Das was indeed involved in national education, but his primary role was not as principal of the Bengal National College; Aurobindo Ghosh held that position initially. Acharya Narendra Dev was involved in the educational aspects of the Non-Cooperation Movement, but leading the boycott of government schools and colleges was a collective effort involving many leaders.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah initially supported the Non-Cooperation movement but later withdrew his support. Therefore, only the pairs concerning Gandhi's leadership of the Khilafat Committee and Jinnah's initial support are definitively correct. The other pairs present inaccuracies or incomplete descriptions of the roles played by the individuals.  The question tests knowledge of specific roles within a broader historical context, requiring nuanced understanding.



**4. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Publication               Key Figure/Characteristic
1.  Al Hilal                               :  Propagated rationalist and nationalist ideas
2.  Abhinava Bharat                         :  Advocated revolutionary terrorism
3.  Ghadr Party                             :  Based primarily in North America
4.  Servants of India Society               :  Founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Al Hilal, a newspaper founded by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, is known for its propagation of rationalist and nationalist ideas among Muslims. Abhinava Bharat, a revolutionary organization, was indeed associated with V.D. Savarkar and advocated revolutionary terrorism. The Ghadr Party, with a significant presence in North America, aimed at inciting rebellion against British rule in India. The Servants of India Society was founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale to train social and political workers for India. Therefore, all four pairs correctly link the organizations/publications with their key figures or defining characteristics.  This question demands factual recall of key figures and organizations involved in various facets of the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The inclusion of diverse organizations tests the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the movement's multifaceted nature.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Impact/Consequence
1.  Rowlatt Act (1919)                            :  Strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity
2.  Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) :  Introduction of separate electorates
3.  Official Secrets Act (1904)                  :  Curbed freedom of the press
4.  Indian Universities Act (1904)              :  Increased government control over universities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act, while causing widespread discontent, did not directly lead to strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity; the unity was fostered through other events like the Khilafat movement. The Morley-Minto Reforms did introduce the system of separate electorates, a controversial decision. The Official Secrets Act significantly curbed freedom of the press in India. The Indian Universities Act increased government control over universities, aiming to curtail nationalist activities.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 correctly match the legislation with its immediate consequences.  The question tests the understanding of the impact of specific legislations on the political and social landscape of British India, requiring both factual recall and analytical skills.  The distractor in option 1 tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between cause and effect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                             Year
1.  Treaty of Sevres signed with Turkey            :   1921
2.  Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress :   1922
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident                         :   1919
4.  Gandhi's announcement of mass civil disobedience: 1920
5.  Prince of Wales' visit to India                  :   1920

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Treaty of Sevres was signed in 1920, not 1921.  The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, where the Non-Cooperation movement was endorsed and the Congress creed changed to include the attainment of Swaraj,  occurred in December 1920. Gandhi's announcement of mass civil disobedience, threatening to start it unless political prisoners were released and press restrictions lifted, happened on February 1, 1922. The Chauri Chaura incident, a pivotal event leading to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, took place in February 1922. The Prince of Wales's visit to India, met with large demonstrations, occurred in November 1921. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The distractors (incorrect years) are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the chronology of the Non-Cooperation movement and related events.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to identify and eliminate incorrect information. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                          Key Role/Association during Non-Cooperation Movement
1.  Motilal Nehru                               :   Led the Awadh Kisan Movement
2.  Acharya Narendra Dev                         :   Principal of National College, Calcutta
3.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                           :   Remained a staunch supporter of the movement
4.  Subhas Bose                                 :   President of the All India Khilafat Committee
5.  C.R. Das                                    :   Gave up legal practice to join the movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Motilal Nehru gave up his legal practice to participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement, but he did not lead the Awadh Kisan Movement; that was primarily led by Baba Ramchandra. Acharya Narendra Dev played a crucial role in establishing national educational institutions, including serving as principal of the National College in Calcutta.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah initially supported the movement but later withdrew his support.  Subhas Chandra Bose was not the President of the All India Khilafat Committee; that was Mahatma Gandhi. C.R. Das, along with many other lawyers, indeed gave up his legal practice to participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The incorrect pairings serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the individual roles and their level of involvement in the movement. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills related to the leadership and organization of the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Action                                   Impact/Consequence
1.  Boycott of foreign cloth                    :   Increased imports of foreign cloth
2.  Establishment of national schools and colleges:   Provided alternative education to students
3.  Chauri Chaura incident                     :   Led to the suspension of the movement
4.  Khilafat issue losing relevance              :   Strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity
5.  Nagpur Congress Session                    :   Formal adoption of the Non-Cooperation program


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The boycott of foreign cloth during the Non-Cooperation Movement, indeed, aimed to reduce dependence on foreign goods and promote Swadeshi, resulting in decreased imports, contrary to statement 1. The establishment of national educational institutions provided an alternative to government-run schools and colleges, accurately reflecting statement 2. The Chauri Chaura incident directly led to the suspension of the movement by Gandhi, making statement 3 correct. The Khilafat issue losing relevance after the abolition of the Caliphate weakened Hindu-Muslim unity, contradicting statement 4. The Nagpur session formalized the Congress's adoption of the Non-Cooperation program, accurately reflecting statement 5.  The incorrect pairings test the candidate's understanding of the movement's effects and their ability to differentiate between intended outcomes and actual consequences. This question primarily assesses factual recall and analytical skills concerning the causes and effects of events within the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                              Position/Action
1.  Mustafa Kamal Pasha                         :   Abolished the Khilafat
2.  Rabindranath Tagore                         :   Renounced knighthood after Jallianwala Bagh
3.  Bhagat Singh                                :   Participated in the Khilafat Movement
4.  Captain Sleeman                              :   Associated with the suppression of thugs
5.  Lord Curzon                                 :   Supported the Non-Cooperation Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (Kemal Pasha) played a key role in the modernization of Turkey and abolished the Caliphate. Rabindranath Tagore's renunciation of his knighthood was a direct response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  Bhagat Singh was a revolutionary socialist and not directly involved in the Khilafat movement. Captain Sleeman was indeed associated with the suppression of the Thugs. Lord Curzon was hostile to the nationalist movement and would not have supported the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between individuals and their actions, requiring both factual recall and analytical skills. The question assesses the ability to link historical figures to specific events and actions, testing knowledge of Indian and international history.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the growth of Indian nationalism, key figures, and their ideologies, drawing heavily on the nuances of the provided text.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Association/Organization
1. Dadabhai Naoroji           :   Bombay Presidency Association
2. Surendranath Banerjea     :   Indian Association of Calcutta
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale      :    Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
4. A. O. Hume                 :    East India Association, London


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was significantly associated with the Bombay Association, playing a key role in its activities and representing Indian interests. Surendranath Banerjea was a founder and prominent leader of the Indian Association of Calcutta, a crucial precursor to the Indian National Congress.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was deeply involved with the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, contributing greatly to its intellectual and political influence. However, A.O. Hume is incorrectly paired with the East India Association, London. While he was instrumental in establishing the Indian National Congress, the East India Association was primarily associated with Dadabhai Naoroji.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mismatching of A.O. Hume with the East India Association. The other pairings are historically accurate, reflecting the prominent roles these leaders played in their respective organizations, which were pivotal in the early stages of the Indian nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Demand                     Description
1. Indianisation of Services   :  Primarily based on moral grounds, advocating for equal opportunities for Indians.
2. Swarajya                    :  Demanded self-government within the British Empire, modeled after self-governing colonies.
3. Expansion of Legislative Councils: Primarily focused on increasing the number of Indian members in the councils.
4. No Taxation Without Representation:  A slogan echoing the American cry for self-governance and fiscal autonomy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the demands and their underlying justifications during the moderate phase of the Indian National Congress. The Indianisation of services was indeed advocated on economic, political, and moral grounds, highlighting the inefficiency and injustice of the existing system.  Swarajya represented the aspiration for self-governance within the British Empire, drawing inspiration from successful dominion status models.  The expansion of legislative councils was a central demand, aiming to increase Indian representation and influence. The slogan "No taxation without representation" directly mirrored the American struggle for self-governance and fiscal autonomy, emphasizing the need for Indian control over their own resources. Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer. The other options are incomplete, failing to capture the full range of demands and their significance in the early nationalist movement.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                      Stance on Council Entry (1920s)
1. Motilal Nehru              :   Initially opposed, later reconciled with Swarajists.
2. C. Rajagopalachari          :   Strongly opposed, advocating for constructive work.
3. C. R. Das                   :   Initially supported, forming the Swarajya Party.
4. Vallabhbhai Patel           :  Initially opposed, later supported the Swarajist's work within the Congress.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly reflect the stances of these prominent Congress leaders regarding entry into legislative councils during the 1920s. Motilal Nehru initially opposed council entry but later found common ground with the Swarajists. C. Rajagopalachari remained a staunch opponent, prioritizing constructive work and non-cooperation. C.R. Das was a key proponent of council entry, leading to the formation of the Swarajya Party. Vallabhbhai Patel was initially opposed but eventually reconciled to the Swarajists' participation within the Congress framework.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the nuanced positions of all four leaders on this critical issue within the Indian National Congress.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and inaccurate, overlooking the complexities of the debate and the evolution of certain leaders' stances.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of the Movement           Characteristic
1.  Boycott of Councils              :  Initially met with some internal opposition within the Congress.
2.  Participation of Students          :  Led to the establishment of numerous national educational institutions.
3.  Hindu-Muslim Unity             :  Strengthened by the shared goal of opposing British rule and Khilafat.
4.  Economic Boycott (Khadi)        :  Partially successful but faced limitations due to higher cost of Khadi.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement witnessed a complex interplay of factors. The boycott of councils faced internal resistance from some Congress leaders who favored constitutional methods. The movement's success in mobilizing students led to the creation of numerous national educational institutions as an alternative to government-run schools. The Khilafat issue played a crucial role in fostering Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule. The economic boycott focused on Khadi, which, while gaining traction, faced challenges due to its higher cost compared to foreign cloth.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, accurately reflecting the significant aspects of the Non-Cooperation Movement. Option (d) is incorrect since more than one pair is correctly matched. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect, as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Group/Leader     Significant Action/Event
1.  Hindustan Republican Association (HRA):   Kakori Conspiracy
2.  Bhagat Singh                     :   Bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly
3.  Surya Sen                        :   Chittagong Armoury Raid
4.  Chandrashekhar Azad             :   Formation of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The HRA, later evolving into the HSRA, was directly involved in the Kakori train robbery, a significant event in the early revolutionary movement. Bhagat Singh played a pivotal role in the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly. Surya Sen led the daring Chittagong Armoury Raid.  While Chandrashekhar Azad was a key figure in the revolutionary movement, the formation of the HSRA involved a collective leadership, not solely Azad himself. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer, as it accurately matches three out of the four pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) are inaccurate, either over- or under-representing the correct pairings.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of individual contributions and organizational actions within the revolutionary movement.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Detained/Imprisoned     Year of Event
1. Lala Lajpat Rai                 : 1908
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak            : 1907
3. Krishna Kumar Mitra            : 1907
4. Ajit Singh                      : 1908
5. Chidambaram Pillai             : 1908


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly mentions the detention or imprisonment of several individuals.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and imprisoned for six years in 1908.  Krishna Kumar Mitra was among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908.  Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment in Madras is also mentioned in 1908. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect as Lajpat Rai's deportation occurred in 1907, not 1908.  This question tests factual recall of specific events and their chronology within the context of the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be close to the correct years, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical events. Options (a), (b), and (c) are designed to mislead candidates with partially correct pairings, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in answering this question. The difficulty is increased by the need for precise recall of the year of each event.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader's Stance/Action          Description
1. Aurobindo Ghose                : Advocated for complete independence
2. Bipin Chandra Pal               : Primarily focused on constitutional methods
3. Dadabhai Naoroji                 :  Declared the goal of the Indian National Congress as "self-government"
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                : Described the reaction of young Indians in England to Tilak's activities
5. Gokhale                          : Condemned the Partition of Bengal in 1905


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that Aurobindo Ghose openly declared that "Political Freedom is the lifebreath of a nation," indicating his advocacy for complete independence (Pair 1). Dadabhai Naoroji's presidential address at the 1906 Calcutta session of the Congress declared the goal as "self-government," making Pair 3 correct.  Gokhale, as president of the Congress in 1905, condemned the Partition of Bengal, confirming Pair 5. Jawaharlal Nehru's observations on the reactions of young Indians in England to Tilak's activities are also documented in the text (Pair 4).  Pair 2 is incorrect because the passage describes Bipin Chandra Pal as a militant nationalist, who advocated for more radical methods than solely constitutional ones. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the different approaches and viewpoints within the early nationalist movement. The distractors are created by manipulating the leaders' positions and actions to create plausible but incorrect pairings.  The difficulty lies in distinguishing between the nuances of the leaders' positions and actions.  Only option (d) accurately reflects the factual information provided in the text.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Publication        Association/Event
1.  *Yugantar*                     :  Advocated revolutionary terrorism
2.  *India*                         : Published by the British Committee of the Indian National Congress
3. Abhinava Bharat                 : Founded by V.D. Savarkar
4. Anushilan Samiti                : Had 500 branches in its Dacca section alone
5.  *The Kal*                       : Published in Maharashtra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text directly links *Yugantar* to the advocacy of revolutionary terrorism (Pair 1).  It mentions the British Committee of the Indian National Congress publishing *India* (Pair 2). The founding of Abhinava Bharat by V.D. Savarkar is explicitly stated (Pair 3). The Anushilan Samiti's extensive network with 500 branches in Dacca is also mentioned (Pair 4). Finally, *The Kal* being a publication from Maharashtra is confirmed (Pair 5). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various organizations and publications associated with the nationalist movement, particularly the revolutionary wing. The distractors are formed by combining organizations and publications from different periods and contexts. The difficulty lies in the diverse range of entities and the need for precise recall.  Each pair is correctly matched according to the provided text.


**4. With reference to the British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                             Description
1. Permanent Settlement                 : Introduced by Lord Cornwallis
2. Ryotwari System                       :  Introduced by Lord Dalhousie
3. Vernacular Press Act of 1878          : Imposed restrictions on the Indian language press
4.  Indian Councils Act of 1892          : Criticized by nationalists for its inadequacy
5.  Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909        : Introduced separate electorates for Muslims



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly attributes the Permanent Settlement to Lord Cornwallis (Pair 1). The introduction of the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 and its restrictive nature on the Indian language press is mentioned (Pair 3). The Indian Councils Act of 1892 facing criticism from nationalists for being insufficient is also stated (Pair 4). The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 and the introduction of separate electorates are explicitly linked (Pair 5). Pair 2 is incorrect; while the Ryotwari system is discussed, it's not directly linked to Lord Dalhousie's actions in the provided text.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of key British policies and their historical context.  The distractors are created by misattributing policies to different individuals or periods, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical details.  Option (b) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.  The question's difficulty stems from the need for precise knowledge of the individuals associated with the implementation of various British policies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                           Year
1.  Partition of Bengal formally announced  : 1903
2.  Surat Split of the Indian National Congress : 1907
3.  First session of the Indian National Congress : 1885
4.  Attempt on the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal : 1908
5.  Annulment of the Partition of Bengal     : 1911


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text accurately notes the year of the Surat Split (Pair 2), the first session of the Indian National Congress (Pair 3), the attempt on the Lieutenant-Governor's life (Pair 4), and the annulment of the Partition of Bengal (Pair 5).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Partition of Bengal was formally announced in July 1905, not 1903.  This question tests chronological knowledge of key events in the Indian nationalist movement. The distractors involve manipulating the years associated with significant events, testing the candidate's precise understanding of historical timelines. The difficulty of this question lies in the need for precise recall of dates and the subtle differences in the years presented as distractors. Option (b) correctly identifies the correctly matched pairs.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to religious and social reform movements in India, and historiographical approaches to modern Indian history.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Reform Movement Leader              Key Reform Focus
    1.  Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha       :  Women's education and social status among Parsis
    2.  Akali Movement                   :   Purification of Gurudwara management
    3.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan's Movement    :   Abolition of polygamy and easy divorce among Muslims

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha, established in 1851, was a prominent Parsi religious reform association.  Its key aims included modernizing Parsi social customs, particularly concerning women's education and their overall social standing. The Akali Movement, which gained momentum after 1920, was primarily focused on reforming the management of Sikh gurudwaras, which had fallen under the control of corrupt mahants.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist zeal extended to the social sphere, where he advocated for raising women's status, ending purdah, and condemning practices like polygamy and easy divorce.  All three pairs accurately reflect the primary reform focus of their respective movements. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Historian/School of Thought        Historiographical Approach
    1.  James Mill                          :   Subaltern Approach
    2.  Ranajit Guha                       :   Colonial Approach
    3.  A.R. Desai                         :   Marxist Approach

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A.R. Desai's work, particularly "Social Background of Indian Nationalism," is a significant contribution to Marxist historiography in India.  His approach emphasizes class struggle and the inherent contradictions within Indian society during the colonial period. James Mill's writings represent the colonial approach, characterized by an Orientalist perspective and a justification of British rule. Ranajit Guha is a key figure in the subaltern school, which critiques elite-centric historical narratives and focuses on the voices and experiences of marginalized groups.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historiographical affiliations of at least one of the historians/schools of thought.


**3.  With reference to the historiography of modern India, consider the following pairs:**

    Historiographical Approach           Key Characteristic
    1. Nationalist Approach             :  Emphasis on the exploitative nature of colonial rule
    2. Cambridge School Approach       :  Focus on internal conflicts among Indians
    3. Communalist Approach             :  View of Hindus and Muslims as perpetually hostile groups

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Nationalist approach to Indian history actively countered colonial narratives by highlighting the exploitative nature of British rule and emphasizing the unity of the Indian people in their struggle for independence. The Cambridge School, in contrast, focuses on internal conflicts and power struggles among different Indian groups as the primary drivers of historical events. The Communalist Approach presents a simplistic and divisive view of Indian history, portraying Hindus and Muslims as inherently antagonistic groups.  All three pairs accurately reflect a key characteristic of their respective approaches to Indian history. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of at least one of the given pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Religious Reform Figure              Significant Contribution
    1. Dadabhai Naoroji                   :  Religious reform among Parsis
    2. Swami Dayanand Saraswati          :  Revival of Vedic Hinduism
    3. Muhammad Iqbal                     :  Emphasis on constant change and ceaseless activity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Dadabhai Naoroji was involved in the Parsi religious reform movement, his primary contributions were in the realm of economics and nationalist politics.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati is correctly associated with the Arya Samaj movement and its emphasis on reviving Vedic Hinduism.  Muhammad Iqbal, though a poet and philosopher, is also accurately linked to his emphasis on dynamism, activity, and rejection of passive resignation, which resonates with his broader humanist philosophy. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent or omit the accurate connections between the figures and their contributions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Early Nationalist Leader           Political Method/Stance
    1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                 :   Advocated for separate electorates for Muslims
    2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale            :  Constitutional agitation and gradual political progress
    3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak              :  Emphasis on passive resistance and boycott


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, while a prominent early nationalist, did not advocate for separate electorates. That position was primarily associated with the Muslim League and figures like the Aga Khan. Gopal Krishna Gokhale is accurately depicted as a leader of the Moderate nationalists, emphasizing constitutional methods and gradual reform.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a leader of the Extremist faction, is also correctly linked to his emphasis on passive resistance and boycotts as methods of political action.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the political stances or methods of at least one of the early nationalist leaders.


**6. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Legislation                  Impact/Consequence
    1.  Ilbert Bill Controversy          :  Heightened Hindu-Muslim tensions
    2.  Partition of Bengal (1905)     :   Rise of militant nationalism
    3.  Formation of Indian National Congress :  Increased participation of Muslims in early years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ilbert Bill controversy, while causing some tensions, did not primarily heighten Hindu-Muslim tensions in the same way the Partition of Bengal did. The Partition of Bengal (1905) directly led to the rise of militant nationalism and Swadeshi movement, as it was seen as a divisive tactic by the British. The formation of the Indian National Congress initially saw participation from Muslims, though later communal tensions would emerge. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are accurately matched regarding their impact. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the impact of at least one event/legislation or include inaccurate pairings.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Post-Non-Cooperation Movement Development     Prominent Figure/Group
    1.  Formation of the Swaraj Party                :   Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das
    2.  Growth of Socialist Ideas in the Congress    :   Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose
    3.  Bardoli Satyagraha                           :   Mahatma Gandhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Swaraj Party, formed in response to the Non-Cooperation Movement's end, was indeed spearheaded by Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das.  The rise of socialist ideas within the Congress is accurately attributed to the influence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. However, the Bardoli Satyagraha was primarily led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, not Mahatma Gandhi, although Gandhi's support and influence were considerable.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the leadership of the Bardoli Satyagraha or include inaccurate pairings.


**8. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision of the Act                     Feature
    1.  Provincial Autonomy                 :   Replaced dyarchy
    2.  All-India Federation                 :   Never implemented due to princely state opposition
    3.  Separate Electorates                  :   Reinforced communal divisions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchical system. The proposed All-India Federation, a key element of the Act, never materialized due to the non-cooperation of many princely states. The Act also unfortunately perpetuated the system of separate electorates, further exacerbating communal divisions.  All three pairs accurately describe features of the 1935 Act and their consequences.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one accurately matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Figure/Event Related to the 1930s Congress Crisis          Description
    1.  Haripura Session (1938)                        :  Subhas Chandra Bose elected Congress President
    2.  Tripuri Session (1939)                           :  Gandhi's support for Pattabhi Sitaramayya
    3.  Formation of the Forward Bloc                     :  Response to the Congress crisis by Subhas Bose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Haripura session of the Indian National Congress in 1938 is correctly associated with the unanimous election of Subhas Chandra Bose as Congress President. The Tripuri session in 1939 saw a contest for the Congress presidency, and Gandhi's support for Pattabhi Sitaramayya is historically accurate.  The formation of the Forward Bloc by Subhas Chandra Bose was a direct consequence of the internal crisis within the Congress. All three pairs accurately reflect events and figures related to the Congress crisis of the 1930s. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Gandhi's Ideological Stance              Characteristic
    1.  Economy                               :   Emphasis on village self-sufficiency and decentralized production
    2.  Government                             :   Skeptical of centralized state power and advocated for village republics
    3.  Women's Role                          :   Advocated for women's participation in the freedom struggle but held traditional views on their domestic roles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gandhi's economic philosophy emphasized village self-sufficiency, decentralized production, and a rejection of large-scale industrialization. His vision of governance was characterized by a deep skepticism towards centralized state power, advocating instead for a decentralized system of village republics.  His views on women's role were complex: he championed their participation in the freedom struggle but also held traditional views regarding their primary responsibilities within the home.  All three pairs correctly reflect aspects of Gandhi's ideological stance. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect, as they omit at least one accurate pairing.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the Indian National Movement, its leaders, and associated events.  Note that some names and events may be less prominently featured in standard UPSC preparation materials, adding to the difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Contribution to Early Indian Nationalism
1. Dadabhai Naoroji           :  Authored "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India"
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale     :  Advocated for Swarajya within the British Empire
3. Surendranath Banerjea    :  Presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress
4. Pherozeshah Mehta        :  Prominent leader of the Bombay Presidency Association

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's seminal work, "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," provided a powerful economic critique of British colonial rule, highlighting the "drain of wealth" from India.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader, advocated for Swarajya (self-rule) within the framework of the British Empire, emphasizing gradual constitutional reforms. Pherozeshah Mehta was a key figure in the Bombay Presidency Association, a significant precursor to the Indian National Congress, contributing significantly to the early nationalist movement.  However, Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress, not Surendranath Banerjea, who was involved in the early Congress but held other key positions.  Option (b) accurately reflects the contributions of Naoroji, Gokhale, and Mehta to early Indian nationalism. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, creating plausible but ultimately incorrect distractors.


**2. With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                Event
1. 1885              :   Second session of the Indian National Congress held in Calcutta
2. 1886              :   First session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay
3. 1890              :  Kadambini Ganguly addressed a Congress session
4. 1892              : The Indian Councils Act was passed

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay in 1885,  while the second session was held in Calcutta in 1886.  Kadambini Ganguly, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University, did indeed address a Congress session in 1890, symbolizing the growing involvement of women in the nationalist movement. The Indian Councils Act, a significant piece of legislation that introduced limited Indian representation in legislative councils, was passed in 1892.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings of years and events, serving as effective distractors designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the chronology of the early nationalist movement in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Political Ideology/Stance
1. Dadabhai Naoroji           :  Complete Independence (Purna Swaraj)
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale     :  Dominion Status within the British Empire
3. Subhas Chandra Bose      :  Advocated for a synthesis of Socialism and Fascism ("Samyavada")
4. Mahatma Gandhi           :  Initially opposed council entry; later reconciled


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose's "Samyavada" represented a unique political ideology that attempted to combine elements of socialism and fascism, though his ultimate goal was complete independence.  Gandhi's initial opposition to council entry is well-documented, reflecting his early emphasis on mass movements and non-cooperation.  His later reconciliation with the Swarajists who did participate in councils demonstrated his pragmatic approach to achieving independence.  However,  Dadabhai Naoroji, while a strong critic of British rule, did not explicitly advocate for complete independence in his early years; his focus was on gradual reforms.  Gokhale, a moderate leader, primarily championed dominion status within the British Empire.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the ideological stances of these key figures in the Indian National Movement, creating effective distractors.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                  Event/Development
1. 1919                 :  Treaty of Sevres signed
2. 1920                 :  Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress
3. 1921                 :  Prince of Wales' visit to India met with protests
4. 1922                 :  Chauri Chaura incident


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Treaty of Sevres, which significantly impacted the Ottoman Empire and fueled the Khilafat Movement, was signed in 1919. The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress in 1920 formally adopted the Non-Cooperation program. The visit of the Prince of Wales to India in 1921 was met with widespread protests and strikes, demonstrating the growing anti-British sentiment. The Chauri Chaura incident, a tragic episode of violence in 1922, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.  All the pairings in option (d) are historically accurate, correctly linking the events and developments to their respective years.  The other options, by excluding one or more of these key events, provide plausible yet incorrect distractors, testing the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the timeline and key features of the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Prominent Leader/Figure
1. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) :  Bhagat Singh
2. Forward Bloc                     :   Subhas Chandra Bose
3. All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) :  Lala Lajpat Rai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) All three

**Explanation:**

Bhagat Singh was a key figure in the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organization that advocated for complete independence through armed struggle. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc, a political faction within the Congress that advocated for a more radical and assertive approach to independence.  Lala Lajpat Rai served as the first president of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), demonstrating the early connections between the nationalist movement and the burgeoning trade union movement in India.  All three pairs correctly link the organizations to their prominent leaders. Options (a), (b), and (d) create plausible distractors by suggesting that only some or none of the pairings are correct, thereby testing the candidate's knowledge of these significant organizations and their leaders during the Indian independence struggle.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may indirectly relate to the same underlying theme (British policies in India), but they will focus on distinct factual pairs.  The difficulty level is aimed at "difficult" by incorporating subtle and nuanced distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                     Specific Policy/Act
1. Revenue Administration          :  Izaredari System (Hastings)
2. Labour Legislation              :  Indian Factory Act, 1891 (Minimum age increased to 9 years)
3. Social Reform                   :  Abolition of Sati
4. Press Restrictions              :  Vernacular Press Act, 1878 (Repealed in 1882)
5. Princely States Policy          :  Subordinate Union (Paramountcy)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Izaredari system was a revenue collection method implemented by Warren Hastings.  The Indian Factory Act of 1891 is accurately described with its key feature of raising the minimum age for child labor. The abolition of Sati is a well-known social reform undertaken during British rule. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, though later repealed, represents a key instance of British press control. Finally, the policy of "Subordinate Union" (also known as Paramountcy) accurately reflects the British approach to princely states.  Options (a), (b), and (d) present plausible distractors by omitting or incorrectly associating some policies, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of specific British administrative measures in India.  The question assesses factual recall, analysis (linking policy areas to specific actions), and conceptual understanding (grasping the essence of each policy).


**2. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   British Official/Policymaker  :  Significant Policy/Action
1. Lord Cornwallis                 :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System
2. Lord Dalhousie                  :   Doctrine of Lapse
3. Lord Lytton                     :   Vernacular Press Act, 1878
4. Lord Ripon                      :   Local Self-Government measures
5. Lord Curzon                     :   Partition of Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Lord Cornwallis is associated with the Permanent Settlement, not the Ryotwari System (option 1 is incorrect). Lord Dalhousie's implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse and Lord Lytton's enactment of the Vernacular Press Act are historically accurate (options 2 and 3 are correct).  Lord Ripon's contributions to local self-government are also well-documented (option 4 is incorrect). Finally, the Partition of Bengal is correctly linked to Lord Curzon (option 5 is correct).  The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, demanding precise knowledge of the actions and policies of various British governors-general.  The question tests factual recall, and an understanding of the historical context of British administration.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System              :   Geographical Area of Primary Implementation
1. Ryotwari System             :   Bengal and Bihar
2. Mahalwari System            :   Madras Presidency
3. Permanent Settlement         :   North-Western Provinces and Punjab

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Ryotwari system was primarily implemented in Madras Presidency and Bombay Presidency, not Bengal and Bihar (option 1 is incorrect). The Mahalwari system was implemented in the North-Western Provinces and Punjab, not the Madras Presidency (option 2 is incorrect). The Permanent Settlement was introduced in Bengal and Bihar, not the North-Western Provinces and Punjab (option 3 is incorrect). This question tests detailed factual recall about the geographical application of the different revenue systems, highlighting the complexities and variations within British revenue policies across India.


**4. With reference to 19th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer/Thinker      :  Key Reform/Idea
1. Raja Ram Mohan Roy          :   Advocated for Widow Remarriage
2. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar   :   Supported the abolition of Sati
3. Sayyid Ahmad Khan           :   Promoted the concept of ‘Separate Electorates’

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar were both strong advocates for social reforms, including widow remarriage and the abolition of Sati (options 1 and 2 are correct). However, Sayyid Ahmad Khan, while a significant social and educational reformer, is not directly associated with the concept of "Separate Electorates" which emerged later in the political landscape (option 3 is incorrect).  The inclusion of Sayyid Ahmad Khan as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of his role within the broader context of 19th-century social and political reform.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various reform movements and the individuals who spearheaded them.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation             :   Primary Aim/Effect
1. Indian Councils Act of 1892 :   Introduced a system of direct elections for all council members
2. Morley-Minto Reforms (1909):   Increased Indian representation in legislative councils
3. Rowlatt Act (1919)          :   Curtailed civil liberties in the name of national security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did increase Indian representation, but it didn't introduce direct elections for all members, as elections were still indirect (option 1 is incorrect). The Morley-Minto Reforms did indeed increase Indian representation, and the Rowlatt Act is correctly identified for its curtailment of civil liberties (options 2 and 3 are correct).  The question assesses the candidate's precise knowledge of the details of important legislative acts during the British Raj, testing their understanding of the evolution of Indian political participation and the limitations imposed on civil liberties.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Demand of Early Indian Nationalists             Related Aspect
1.  Larger share in government                     :   Principle of democracy
2.  Indian control over public purse                :   "No taxation without representation" slogan
3.  Swarajya or self-government                   :   Model of self-governing colonies like Australia and Canada
4.  Rapid development of modern industries         :   Tariff protection and direct government aid
5.  Reduction of land revenue                       :   Lightening the burden of taxation on peasants

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The early Indian nationalists, in their pursuit of self-governance, advocated for a larger Indian presence in the government, aligning with democratic principles.  Their demand for Indian control over public finances resonated with the American cry of "No taxation without representation," highlighting their desire for equitable governance. The aspiration for Swarajya, or self-rule, drew inspiration from successful self-governing colonies within the British Empire, demonstrating their understanding of feasible models of governance.  To address India's economic backwardness, they championed the rapid development of modern industries, proposing methods like tariff protection and government support to foster growth. Finally, the persistent calls for land revenue reduction aimed at alleviating the financial burdens on the peasantry, a core segment of Indian society.  Therefore, option (b) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the early nationalists' demands.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader                     Specific Advocacy
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                           :   Advocated for the abolition of the salt tax
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                      :   Championed Indianisation of higher administrative services
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                         :   Promoted the use of Indian goods (Swadeshi)
4.  Surendranath Banerjea                     :   Demanded separation of judicial and executive powers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the specific advocacies of the listed early nationalist leaders. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress, vehemently criticized the high salt tax as a form of economic exploitation, advocating for its abolition. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, known for his moderate approach, strongly championed the Indianization of higher administrative services, arguing for greater Indian participation in governance. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a significant figure in the rise of militant nationalism, fervently promoted the use of Indian goods (Swadeshi) as a means of economic self-reliance and resistance against colonial economic policies.  Surendranath Banerjea, a leading figure in the early nationalist movement, consistently demanded the separation of judicial and executive powers, advocating for an independent judiciary free from executive influence.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs, showcasing an incomplete understanding of the individual contributions of these leaders.


**3.  With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Area                                 Specific Demand
1. Constitutional Reforms                       :   Immediate grant of Dominion Status
2. Economic Reforms                             :   Boycott of British goods
3. Administrative Reforms                        :   Indianisation of higher administrative services
4. Welfare Reforms                              :   Development of agricultural banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The early Indian National Movement did advocate for a boycott of British goods as a form of economic resistance.  The demand for Indianisation of higher administrative services was a key aspect of their administrative reform agenda.  Similarly, the development of agricultural banks was a crucial component of their welfare reform proposals, aimed at protecting the peasantry from moneylenders. However, the demand for the immediate grant of Dominion Status was *not* a feature of this early phase. The demand for self-governance (Swaraj) emerged later and evolved over time.  Therefore, option (a) is correct, while options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair (1) or exclude correctly matched pairs (2, 3, and 4).


**4. With reference to the early Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                              Associated Publication
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                      :   Kesari
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                    :   Indian Opinion
3.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                 :   Bombay Gazette
4.  Surendranath Banerjea                :   The Bengalee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Surendranath Banerjea was closely associated with *The Bengalee* newspaper, which played a significant role in shaping public opinion during the early nationalist movement.  The other pairings are incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji was not associated with *Kesari*; that was primarily associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  Similarly, *Indian Opinion* was associated with Mahatma Gandhi's activities in South Africa, not Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  While Gopal Krishna Gokhale may have contributed to or been involved with various publications, there's no definitive historical evidence associating him specifically with the *Bombay Gazette* to the extent of a direct link as the other pairings suggest. Therefore, only option (d) is correct.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with mismatched leaders and publications, demonstrating a need for more precise factual knowledge.


**5. With reference to the responses of the Indian National Congress to British policies, consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy                                     Congress Response
1.  Partition of Bengal                            :   Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
2.  Rowlatt Act                                    :   Non-Cooperation Movement
3.  Government of India Act, 1935                  :   Formation of Congress Ministries in provinces
4.  Cripps Mission Proposals                       :   Rejection of dominion status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The partition of Bengal sparked the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, a significant phase of Indian nationalism.  The Rowlatt Act, a highly repressive law, directly led to the Non-Cooperation Movement under Gandhi's leadership. The Government of India Act, 1935, despite being rejected in principle by the Congress, did lead to the formation of Congress ministries in several provinces as a strategic political decision.  Finally, the Cripps Mission proposals, which offered dominion status, were rejected by the Congress, as they desired complete independence. Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs, indicating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the Congress's responses to various British policies.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                         Significant Action/Contribution
1.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan               :   Led the Khudai Khidmatgars ("Red Shirts")
2.  Rani Gaidinliu                         :   Participated in the Second Civil Disobedience Movement
3.  Bhagat Singh                             :   Associated with the Hindustan Republican Association
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                 :   Led the Kheda Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," effectively led the Khudai Khidmatgars, a non-violent movement in the North-West Frontier Province. Rani Gaidinliu, a Naga nationalist, actively participated in the Second Civil Disobedience Movement. Bhagat Singh was a prominent figure associated with the Hindustan Republican Association, a revolutionary organization. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in leading the Kheda Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement in Gujarat.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. The other options are incomplete, indicating a lack of knowledge regarding the contributions of these individuals and groups to the Indian National Movement.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Campaign                     Leader
1. Champaran Satyagraha                 :  Jawaharlal Nehru
2. Ahmedabad Mill Strike                :  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
3. Kheda Satyagraha                     :  C. Rajagopalachari
4. Rowlatt Satyagraha                    :  Subhash Chandra Bose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The provided pairings incorrectly link leaders with movements they did not lead.  The Champaran Satyagraha (1917) was led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru.  Similarly, the Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) and the Kheda Satyagraha (1918) were also led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or C. Rajagopalachari respectively. While Patel and Rajagopalachari were prominent figures in the Indian National Congress, they did not lead these specific movements.  Finally, the Rowlatt Satyagraha (1919) was also spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi, not Subhash Chandra Bose, who played a significant role in later movements. This question highlights the importance of accurately associating historical figures with their actions and contributions within the Indian National Movement.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the key figures and events of this pivotal period.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Book                                  Author
1.  Mother India                         :  Lala Lajpat Rai
2.  Gitanjali                             :  Rabindranath Tagore
3.  Anand Math                           :  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee
4.  Satyarth Prakash                     :  Swami Dayanand Saraswati


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Rabindranath Tagore authored *Gitanjali*, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee wrote *Anand Math*, and Swami Dayanand Saraswati penned *Satyarth Prakash*. These are well-known works of literature and philosophy that hold significant historical and cultural importance in India. Option 1 is incorrect.  *Mother India* was written by  Catherine Mayo, not Lala Lajpat Rai.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent Indian authors and their significant literary contributions. The distractor (Lala Lajpat Rai) is a prominent figure in Indian nationalism, making it a plausible, yet incorrect, association.  Understanding the authorship of these books is crucial for comprehending the intellectual and cultural landscape of the time.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Satyagraha                                 Location
1.  Bardoli Satyagraha                        :  Bihar
2.  Kheda Satyagraha                          :  Gujarat
3.  Champaran Satyagraha                     :  Maharashtra
4.  Non-Cooperation Movement                :  Punjab


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Kheda Satyagraha took place in Kheda district of Gujarat, and the Non-Cooperation Movement was a nationwide movement although it had significant impact across various regions of India including Punjab.  Pair 1 is incorrect as the Bardoli Satyagraha occurred in Gujarat, not Bihar. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the Champaran Satyagraha happened in Champaran district of Bihar, not Maharashtra. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the geographical locations of significant events in the Indian National Movement.  The incorrect pairings feature states that were involved in other major events of the movement, creating plausible but incorrect associations.  Accurate recall of the locations is crucial for a holistic understanding of the movement's spread and impact across India.


**4. With reference to early Indian Nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Founder/Key Figure
1.  British India Association               :  Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  Indian Association                     :  Surendranath Banerjea
3.  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale
4.  East India Association                  :  A. O. Hume


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Indian Association was founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, while the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded by Mahadev Govind Ranade and others.  Option 1 is incorrect because while Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent member and leader of the British India Association, he didn't found it. The British India Association emerged from a merger of earlier organizations. Option 4 is also incorrect because the East India Association was founded by Dadabhai Naoroji, not A. O. Hume, who is associated with the founding of the Indian National Congress.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the organizational structures and key figures involved in early Indian nationalism. The incorrect options feature prominent nationalists, creating plausible yet incorrect associations. Understanding the founding and leadership of these organizations is crucial to understanding the evolution of the nationalist movement.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                         Key Feature
1.  Rowlatt Act                             :  Expanded the powers of the legislative councils
2.  Indian Councils Act of 1892            :  Allowed for trials without juries
3.  Government of India Act, 1919          :  Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4.  Indian Universities Act of 1904        :  Increased government control over universities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces, dividing administrative powers between the Governor and elected ministers. The Indian Universities Act of 1904 significantly increased government control over universities' administration and curriculum.  Option 1 is incorrect as the Rowlatt Act was known for its repressive measures, allowing for trials without juries and imprisonment without trial, not for expanding legislative council powers. Option 2 is also incorrect; the Indian Councils Act of 1892 expanded the legislative councils, introducing a limited form of election, but didn't allow for trials without juries. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of significant legislation passed during the British Raj and their core features.  The incorrect options include features of other acts, creating plausible yet incorrect associations.  An understanding of these acts is crucial for analyzing the evolution of the British government's policies towards India.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement/Organization           Prominent Leader
1.  Arya Samaj                             :  Swami Vivekananda
2.  Prarthana Samaj                       :  R.G. Bhandarkar
3.  Theosophical Society in India          :  Annie Besant
4.  Self-Respect Movement                 :  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. R.G. Bhandarkar was a prominent leader of the Prarthana Samaj. Annie Besant played a significant role in the Theosophical Society in India.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker spearheaded the Self-Respect Movement. Option 1 is incorrect; the Arya Samaj was founded and led by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, not Swami Vivekananda, who was associated with the Ramakrishna Mission.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various social and religious reform movements in India and their key leaders. The incorrect option includes a prominent figure from a related religious reform movement, creating a plausible yet incorrect association.  A clear understanding of these movements is vital for comprehending the socio-religious transformations of the period.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Early Nationalist Leader       Demand/Action
    1. Dadabhai Naoroji             :  Advocated for Dominion Status in 1906
    2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale       :  Demanded Self-Government within the British Empire in 1904
    3. Surendranath Banerjea      :  Presided over the Second National Conference in Calcutta, 1886
    4. Pherozeshah Mehta           :  Championed 'No taxation without representation'

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent figure in the early Indian National Congress, did indeed advocate for self-government, but more accurately, he put forward the demand for Swaraj (self-rule) within the British Empire in 1906, not Dominion Status.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, another significant leader, also championed self-government within the British Empire, but he did so in 1905, not 1904.  Surendranath Banerjea was indeed involved in the Second National Conference held in Calcutta in 1886, which eventually merged with the Indian National Congress.  Pherozeshah Mehta is correctly linked to the slogan "No taxation without representation," reflecting the early nationalists' demand for greater Indian participation in governance and control over finances.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are completely accurate.


**2. With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

    Year         Event/Demand
    1. 1885       :  Demand for expansion and reform of Legislative Councils
    2. 1890       :  Kadambini Ganguly addressed a Congress session
    3. 1892       :  Indian Councils Act passed, granting Indians some elected representation
    4. 1905       :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale's demand for Swaraj from the Congress platform


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect events and demands during the early years of the Indian National Congress. The year 1885 marks the founding of the Congress, with early demands focused on expanding and reforming the Legislative Councils to increase Indian participation.  1890 witnessed Kadambini Ganguly, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University, addressing a Congress session, a significant symbolic moment.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, a direct result of nationalist pressure, did introduce a limited form of elected Indian representation in the councils. Finally, 1905 saw Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent Congress leader, publicly advocating for Swaraj (self-rule) within the British Empire, marking a shift towards bolder demands for self-governance.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

     Early Nationalist  Primary Focus/Contribution
     1.  Mahadev Govind Ranade    :  Economic critique of British imperialism and drain theory
     2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak       :  Advocated for complete independence
     3.  R.C. Dutt                  :  Promoted Swadeshi movement and boycott of British goods
     4.  Dinshaw E. Wacha          :  Led the Akali Movement in Punjab


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Mahadev Govind Ranade, a key figure in the early nationalist movement, significantly contributed to the economic critique of British rule in India, particularly through his analysis of the "drain of wealth" to Britain.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, while initially a moderate, later became a prominent extremist leader advocating for complete independence from British rule, moving beyond the moderate's focus on self-government within the empire.  R.C. Dutt, a prominent economist and nationalist, played a crucial role in popularizing the Swadeshi movement (promoting Indian goods) and the boycott of British goods.  However, the Akali Movement, focusing on the reform of Sikh religious institutions, was not led by Dinshaw E. Wacha; it was a distinct movement led by Sikh leaders.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

    Leader                  Method of Political Work
    1. Dadabhai Naoroji        :  Advocated for violent resistance against British rule.
    2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale   :  Emphasized constitutional agitation and petitions.
    3. Surendranath Banerjea  :  Promoted revolutionary terrorism and secret societies.
    4. Pherozeshah Mehta       :  Focused on creating public opinion through speeches and writings.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The early phase of the Indian National Movement was characterized by a predominantly moderate approach.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Pherozeshah Mehta were key figures representing this approach. Gokhale's strategy heavily relied on constitutional methods, including petitions and working within the existing political system to gradually achieve reforms. Mehta effectively used speeches and writings to build public opinion and support for nationalist demands.  Dadabhai Naoroji, while advocating for self-rule, did not advocate for violent resistance; his approach was primarily constitutional and focused on exposing the economic exploitation of India by the British.  Surendranath Banerjea also employed constitutional methods rather than revolutionary terrorism.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the methods employed by these leaders during the early phase.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Act/Policy        Impact/Consequence
    1. Indian Councils Act of 1892 :  Led to the complete satisfaction of Indian nationalists.
    2. Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909: Introduced separate electorates for Muslims.
    3. Government of India Act 1935:  Established a fully independent Indian government.
    4.  Vernacular Press Act 1878   :  Curtailed freedom of the Indian-language press.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b) Only two

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils and introducing some elected Indian representation, did not satisfy Indian nationalists; their demands for greater power and control over the budget remained largely unmet. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, designed to appease Muslim concerns, did indeed introduce separate electorates, a controversial move that had long-term consequences for communal harmony. The Government of India Act of 1935, while introducing provincial autonomy, did not establish a fully independent government. It granted a substantial degree of self-governance at the provincial level but did not lead to full independence. Finally, the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 is correctly matched, as it aimed to control and restrict the freedom of the Indian-language press. Thus, only two pairs (2 and 4) are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian Polity and Governance, drawing upon the historical context provided in the source material.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Associated Movement/Organization
1. Dadabhai Naoroji          :   Indian National Liberal Federation
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale   :   Servants of India Society
3. Surendranath Banerjea    :   Indian Association
4. A. O. Hume               :   Indian National Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale founded the Servants of India Society in 1905, aiming to train Indians for public service and promote social reform.  Surendranath Banerjea was a key figure in the Indian Association, an early nationalist organization advocating for Indian self-governance.  A. O. Hume played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.  However, Dadabhai Naoroji was associated with the early Indian National Congress, not the Indian National Liberal Federation.  The Indian National Liberal Federation was formed later, largely representing a more moderate political stance than the early Congress.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include Dadabhai Naoroji's affiliation with the Liberal Federation, demonstrating a need for precise factual recall.


**2. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Demand                                   Early Nationalist Leader Primarily Associated
1.  Swarajya (Self-Government)          :   Bal Gangadhar Tilak
2.  Expansion of Legislative Councils   :   Dadabhai Naoroji
3.  Boycott of British Goods             :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
4.  Indianisation of Higher Services     :   Pherozeshah Mehta

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

While all the listed demands were part of the early nationalist agenda, the primary association with specific leaders requires careful consideration.  Dadabhai Naoroji and Pherozeshah Mehta were prominent advocates for the expansion of legislative councils and Indianisation of higher services, respectively. These were core demands of the moderate nationalists.  However, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, though advocating for self-rule, is more strongly associated with the extremist phase and the Swadeshi movement. Similarly, while Gokhale supported Swadeshi, it wasn't his primary focus; his emphasis was on constitutional methods and social reform. Option (c) correctly identifies the most accurate pairings based on the prominent association of leaders with specific demands in the early phase. Options (a), (b), and (d) present misleading combinations due to the nuances of historical leadership roles within the movement.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                             Key Provision/Impact
1. Indian Councils Act of 1892               :   Introduced a system of direct elections for some council members.
2. Morley-Minto Reforms (1909)              :   Introduced separate electorates for Muslims.
3. Government of India Act of 1935           :   Established provincial autonomy but retained significant Governor-General powers.
4.  Government of India Act of 1919          :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 expanded the councils but did not introduce direct elections; elections were indirect. The Morley-Minto Reforms (1909) are correctly paired with the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, a crucial development in Indian politics. The Government of India Act of 1935 correctly introduced provincial autonomy while maintaining significant powers for the Governor-General, reflecting the continued British control.  The Government of India Act of 1919 is accurately linked to the introduction of dyarchy (dual governance) in provinces.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) misses the accurate pairing of the 1919 act. Option (b) misrepresents the 1892 Act.  Option (d) includes the inaccurate pairing of the 1892 Act, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional developments during the period.



**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                      Role/Contribution
1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah       :  Active participation and leadership within the movement.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi            :  Initiated the movement's call for non-cooperation.
3.  C.R. Das                   :  Opposed the movement's boycott of legislative councils.
4.  Subhas Chandra Bose      :  Initially supported the movement, later formed the Forward Bloc.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement saw significant participation from various leaders.  Mahatma Gandhi is correctly associated with initiating the movement's call for non-cooperation with British rule. C.R. Das initially hesitated about the complete boycott of legislative councils, though he eventually adhered to Congress discipline. Subhas Chandra Bose initially supported the movement but later formed the Forward Bloc, indicating a divergence in political strategies.  However, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while initially supportive of some aspects of the movement, did not participate actively in its leadership. He ultimately held different views regarding the overall strategy of the movement.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include Jinnah's active leadership role, showcasing the importance of precise knowledge of individual contributions within the movement.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                     Year
1.  Foundation of the Indian National Congress : 1886
2.  Partition of Bengal                      : 1906
3.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre               : 1920
4.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                      : 1931

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, not 1886. The Partition of Bengal occurred in 1905, not 1906. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in 1919, not 1920. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in 1931.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing, highlighting the need for accurate chronological knowledge of key events in the Indian National Movement.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in historical timelines.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                      Leader/Prominent Figure
1. Champaran Satyagraha              :  Rajendra Prasad
2. Ahmedabad Mill Strike             :  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
3. Khilafat Movement                  :  Mahatma Gandhi
4. Rowlatt Satyagraha                 :  Muhammad Ali Jinnah
5. Sarabandi Campaign of 1922        :  Chittaranjan Das


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Champaran Satyagraha (1917), Gandhi's first major Satyagraha in India, involved Rajendra Prasad who accompanied Gandhi to Bihar.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) saw Gandhi's successful intervention, leading to a wage increase for the mill workers.  While Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's involvement isn't explicitly stated in the provided text regarding this specific strike, his close collaboration with Gandhi during this period makes this pairing highly probable and factually accurate concerning his political activities.  The Sarabandi Campaign of 1922 was indeed led by Chittaranjan Das.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the leadership of these movements. The Khilafat Movement's leadership was multifaceted, with the Ali Brothers being central figures, not solely Mahatma Gandhi.  Including Muhammad Ali Jinnah with the Rowlatt Satyagraha is a distractor, as while he was a prominent figure in Indian politics during that time, the provided text doesn't link him directly to the leadership of this specific Satyagraha. The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate pairings from a set of plausible but potentially misleading options.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and activism, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Principle                     Associated Event/Action
1.  Truth and Non-violence              :  Champaran Satyagraha
2.  Khadi and Spinning Wheel           :  Rowlatt Satyagraha
3.  Civil Disobedience                  :  Ahmedabad Mill Strike
4.  Hindu-Muslim Unity                 :  Non-Cooperation Movement
5.  Fight against Untouchability         :  Establishment of the All India Harijan Sangh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Gandhi's philosophy centered on Truth and Non-violence, which were central to the Champaran Satyagraha.  The Khadi and Spinning Wheel symbolized self-reliance and were integral to his movements, including the Rowlatt Satyagraha.  While civil disobedience was a core element of many of Gandhi's campaigns, the Ahmedabad Mill Strike, though successful, is not explicitly identified in the text as primarily utilizing civil disobedience as its core method.  The Non-Cooperation Movement significantly aimed to foster Hindu-Muslim unity.  Finally, Gandhi's lifelong commitment to eradicating untouchability culminated in the establishment of the All India Harijan Sangh. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the mismatching of concepts and events.  The question tests conceptual understanding of Gandhi's philosophy and its application in various movements, requiring accurate recall of associated events and actions.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as the association of Khadi with the Rowlatt Satyagraha (though both are relevant to Gandhi's overall philosophy), increases the question's difficulty.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                      Impact/Outcome
1. Rowlatt Act                            :  Increased nationalist mobilization
2. Indian Councils Act of 1892          :  Led to widespread dissatisfaction amongst nationalists
3. Indian Universities Act of 1904      :  Aimed to increase Indian control over universities
4.  Ilbert Bill                             :  Caused significant racial tension in India
5.  Government of India Act 1935         : Established provincial autonomy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act's repressive measures directly fueled nationalist resistance and mobilization. The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils, fell far short of nationalist aspirations, leading to widespread disappointment. The Ilbert Bill controversy highlighted the racial tensions inherent in British rule, as it initially sought to grant Indian judges jurisdiction over European citizens. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy. Option 3 is incorrect because the Indian Universities Act of 1904 aimed to increase government control, not Indian control, over universities. This question tests factual recall and an understanding of the historical impact of key legislation during the Indian freedom struggle. The inclusion of the Ilbert Bill, a less prominently discussed but still significant event, adds to the question's difficulty.



**4. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Leader/Organization             Key Demand/Contribution
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                  :  Advocated for Swadeshi
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale            :  Proposed Swarajya within the British Empire
3. Surendranath Banerjea             :  Founded the Indian Association
4.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak              :  Led the Moderate faction of the Congress
5.  Indian National Congress         :  Focused solely on constitutional methods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent advocate for Swadeshi (use of Indian goods) and famously documented the drain of wealth from India. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, while a moderate, advocated for Swarajya (self-rule) within the framework of the British Empire. Surendranath Banerjea played a crucial role in founding the Indian Association, a key precursor to the Indian National Congress. Option 4 is incorrect because Bal Gangadhar Tilak is associated with the Extremist faction, not the Moderate faction. Option 5 is incorrect because while the early Congress primarily employed constitutional methods, it also addressed various other socio-economic issues. The question demands detailed knowledge of the personalities and their contributions during this period, testing factual recall and understanding of the nuances within the early nationalist movement.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as associating Tilak with the Moderates, increases the difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pre-Congress Nationalist Organization       Prominent Leader
1. British India Association                  :   Dadabhai Naoroji
2. East India Association                    :   Surendranath Banerjea
3. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                  :   Justice Ranade
4. Indian Association of Calcutta            :   A. O. Hume

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 only.  Justice Ranade was instrumental in organizing the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha in the 1870s. This organization played a significant role in the pre-Congress nationalist movement, advocating for administrative and legislative reforms.  Option 1 is incorrect because while Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent leader in the Indian National Movement, he is primarily associated with the East India Association, which he founded in London in 1866. Option 2 is incorrect as Surendranath Banerjea is prominently linked to the Indian Association of Calcutta.  Option 4 is also incorrect because A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, is credited with playing a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, not the Indian Association of Calcutta. The Indian Association was founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose.  Understanding the specific roles and affiliations of these leaders within the various pre-Congress organizations is key to accurately matching them.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between the various organizations and their key figures.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Governor-General/Viceroy       Significant Policy/Event
1. Lord Lytton                             :   Introduction of the Vernacular Press Act
2. Lord Curzon                             :   Partition of Bengal
3. Lord Dalhousie                           :   Doctrine of Lapse
4. Lord Wellesley                           :   Subsidiary Alliance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4. All the pairs are correctly matched. Lord Lytton is known for introducing the repressive Vernacular Press Act of 1878. Lord Curzon implemented the controversial Partition of Bengal in 1905. Lord Dalhousie is infamous for his Doctrine of Lapse, a policy used to annex Indian states.  Lord Wellesley is associated with the Subsidiary Alliance system, a key tool in expanding British power.  The question tests the candidate’s factual knowledge of British policies and their association with specific individuals. It requires precise recall of historical events and policies, demanding a thorough understanding of the colonial period in India.  The inclusion of all correct pairs as options increases the difficulty level and discourages guessing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Indian Nationalist Organization      Primary Objective
1. Landholders’ Society                    :   Promoting workers' rights in tea plantations
2. Bengal British Indian Society           :   Protecting the interests of landlords
3. Madras Native Association              :   Influencing British public opinion on Indian issues
4. Bombay Association                     :   Advocating for the reform of the Civil Service

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 and 4 only. The Landholders’ Society, founded in 1837, primarily aimed at promoting the class interests of the landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The Bengal British Indian Society, established in 1843, focused on protecting and promoting general public interests.  The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association, both founded in 1852, worked towards administrative reforms and greater Indian participation in governance. Option 1 is incorrect because the Landholders' Society was focused on landlord interests. Option 3 is incorrect because influencing British public opinion was a primary goal of the East India Association, not the Madras Native Association. The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the early phases of Indian nationalism and the objectives of different organizations.  The close relationship between some of the organizational goals in the options makes the question challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                     Contribution to Indian Nationalism
1. Raja Rammohun Roy                       :   Advocated for separate electorates for Muslims
2. Dadabhai Naoroji                           :   Authored ‘India for Indians’
3. V. D. Savarkar                            :   Organized the Abhinava Bharat
4. Surendranath Banerjea                   :   Founded the East India Association

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 3 and 4 only. V.D. Savarkar is known for organizing the Abhinava Bharat, a revolutionary secret society. Surendranath Banerjea is associated with founding the Indian Association. Option 1 is incorrect; Raja Rammohun Roy was a social and religious reformer, not directly involved in advocating for separate electorates.  Option 2 is incorrect;  V.D. Savarkar authored ‘India for Indians’. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of key figures in the Indian nationalist movement and their specific contributions, requiring detailed factual recall.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, including figures known for their nationalist activities but not for the specific contribution mentioned, increases the question's difficulty.


**5. With reference to the British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy/Act                         Intended Consequence
1. Permanent Settlement                     :   Increased revenue for the British East India Company
2. Ryotwari System                          :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators
3. Mahalwari System                         :   Strengthening of village communities
4. Vernacular Press Act                     :   Suppression of nationalist sentiments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) 2 and 4 only. The Ryotwari System aimed at direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries. The Vernacular Press Act was designed to suppress the growing nationalist press. Option 1 is incorrect; while the Permanent Settlement aimed to secure a fixed revenue, it did not always lead to increased revenue for the British East India Company due to various factors like famines and the exploitation of ryots. Option 3 is incorrect; the Mahalwari System, while intended to involve village communities, often led to their exploitation and weakening.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of British revenue policies and their impact on Indian society and the application of knowledge to analyze the intended versus actual consequences of these policies. The closely related nature of the options makes the question difficult.


**6. With reference to the pre-independence era in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                  Role/Affiliation
1.  Sir Syed Ahmad Khan                  :   Led the Akali Movement
2.  Muhammad Iqbal                         :   Promoted Muslim separatism in later years
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Organized the Religious Reform Association
4.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :   Led the 1942 Quit India Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 and 4 only.  Muhammad Iqbal, while initially a humanist and patriot, later became a proponent of Muslim separatism. Mahatma Gandhi led the 1942 Quit India Movement. Option 1 is incorrect; Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was a key figure in the Aligarh Movement and advocated for Muslim education and loyalty to the British, but he did not lead the Akali Movement, which was a Sikh reform movement. Option 3 is incorrect; Naoroji Furdonji, Dadabhai Naoroji, and others organized the Religious Reform Association among Parsis.  The question requires detailed knowledge of various figures and their roles within the socio-political landscape of pre-independence India.  The presence of both correct and incorrect pairs related to prominent figures makes it challenging.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                     Primary Outcome
1. Battle of Plassey                        :   Establishment of British rule in Bengal
2. Battle of Buxar                          :   Granting of Diwani rights to the British East India Company
3. First Anglo-Mysore War                   :   Treaty of Madras
4. Third Anglo-Maratha War                   :   Dissolution of the Maratha Confederacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2, 3, and 4 only. The Battle of Buxar led to the British East India Company's acquisition of the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The First Anglo-Mysore War concluded with the Treaty of Madras. The Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the final dissolution of the Maratha Confederacy. Option 1 is partially correct, the Battle of Plassey was a crucial step in the British conquest of Bengal, but it didn't immediately establish complete British rule; that came later.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the major wars and their long-term implications for the British expansion in India.  The nuanced nature of the events and their outcomes makes the question challenging.


**8. With reference to the British Raj in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Viceroy            Significant Action/Policy
1. Lord Minto                            :   Morley-Minto Reforms
2. Lord Curzon                           :   Introduction of the Ilbert Bill
3. Lord Dalhousie                         :   Annexation of Awadh
4. Lord Wellesley                         :   Implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 1 and 3 only. Lord Minto's viceroyalty saw the implementation of the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909. Lord Dalhousie is known for annexing Awadh in 1856. Option 2 is incorrect; Lord Ripon introduced the Ilbert Bill, not Lord Curzon. Option 4 is incorrect; Lord Dalhousie implemented the Doctrine of Lapse, not Lord Wellesley.  This question necessitates precise knowledge of the actions and policies of various viceroys and governor-generals during the British Raj in India.  The inclusion of plausible distractors related to other significant events and policies makes it challenging.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Impact on Indian Society
1.  Indian Factory Act of 1881              :   Complete regulation of working hours for all workers
2.  Vernacular Press Act of 1878             :   Increased freedom for the Indian press
3.  Subsidiary Alliance System               :   Erosion of Indian states' sovereignty
4.  Doctrine of Lapse                        :   Expansion of British territory

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) 3 and 4 only. The Subsidiary Alliance System led to the gradual erosion of Indian states' independence and sovereignty. The Doctrine of Lapse was a policy used by the British to annex Indian states. Option 1 is incorrect; the 1881 Act primarily addressed child labor and did not completely regulate working hours for all workers. Option 2 is incorrect; the Vernacular Press Act restricted the freedom of the Indian press, not increased it. The question assesses the candidate’s ability to link British policies and acts with their impact on Indian society.  The inclusion of incorrect options that are closely related to the actual impacts increases the difficulty level. The question tests conceptual understanding and application of knowledge.


**10. With reference to the growth of Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Movement               Key Characteristic
1.  Moderate Nationalism                     :   Advocated for complete independence
2.  Militant Nationalism                     :   Emphasized passive resistance and Swadeshi
3.  Revolutionary Terrorism                  :   Utilized assassination and violence
4.  Quit India Movement                      :   Mass civil disobedience


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2, 3, and 4 only. Militant nationalism is characterized by passive resistance, Swadeshi, and the call for Swaraj. Revolutionary terrorism involved assassination and violence as methods of political action. The Quit India Movement was a large-scale movement of civil disobedience. Option 1 is incorrect; Moderate nationalism did not advocate for complete independence initially; it focused on gradual reforms within the existing system.  The question tests the candidate’s understanding of different phases and approaches within the Indian nationalist movement. The options are designed to be challenging, testing the candidate’s understanding of the nuanced differences between the various movements and ideologies.  The question tests conceptual understanding and analytical skills.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of British rule in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                          Implementation/Effect
1. Divide and Rule                              :   Restoration of Awadh taluqdars’ lands
2. Hostility Towards Educated Indians         :   Passage of the Vernacular Press Act, 1878
3. Attitude Towards Zamindars                 :   Suppression of social reforms perceived as threatening to orthodox sections
4. Restrictions on Freedom of the Press       :   Use of educated Muslims against the nationalist movement
5. Underdeveloped Social Services              :   Miserable working conditions in 19th-century Indian factories


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately matches the British policies with their corresponding implementations or effects.  The "Divide and Rule" policy (1) indeed involved using existing social divisions, and restoring lands to Awadh taluqdars was a tactic to strengthen alliances with reactionary elements against the nationalist movement. The British hostility towards educated Indians (3) stemmed from their perception of the educated class as a threat to their authority and the rise of nationalism; the suppression of social reforms (3) was a direct consequence of the British policy of aligning with reactionary social groups. The neglect of social services (5) is reflected in the appalling working conditions in factories, which, despite demands for regulation, remained largely unimproved for extended periods.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they contain mismatched pairs.  The Vernacular Press Act (1878) was a direct tool for restricting the freedom of the press (2), not a consequence of hostility towards educated Indians.  Similarly, the use of educated Muslims against the nationalist movement (4) was a specific application of the "Divide and Rule" policy, not a restriction on press freedom. The restoration of Awadh taluqdars’ lands was a consequence of the British policy towards Zamindars (3), not directly related to "Divide and Rule".


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                     Key Feature/Consequence
1. Ryotwari System                    :   Fixed revenue demand for a 30-year period
2. Mahalwari System                    :   Collection directly from individual cultivators
3. Permanent Settlement              :   Proprietary rights granted to Zamindars
4. Hastings’ Izaredari System          :   High revenue rates leading to Zamindari takeovers
5. Overall Impact of British Revenue Systems:   Impoverishment of the peasantry and increased rural indebtedness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately reflects the key features and consequences of the British revenue systems. The Permanent Settlement (3) indeed granted proprietary rights to Zamindars, though this had significant negative consequences. Hastings’ Izaredari system (4) is correctly linked to its high revenue demands and subsequent Zamindari takeovers. The overall impact (5) of these systems accurately describes the widespread impoverishment of the peasantry and the resulting increase in rural indebtedness.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to mismatched pairs. The Ryotwari system (1) did not involve a fixed revenue demand for a 30-year period initially; the period was later revised.  The Mahalwari system (2) was not characterized by direct collection from individual cultivators but rather from village communities.  The collection was done through village headmen.  While the Ryotwari system did collect revenue directly, it was not the defining feature of the Mahalwari system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy in India                       Characteristic/Consequence
1.  Labour Legislations                       :   Exploitation of workers in tea and coffee plantations continued unabated.
2.  White Racism                               :   Systematic exclusion of Indians from higher-grade services.
3.  Revenue Policies                           :   Introduction of the Izaredari system by Warren Hastings.
4.  Attitude Towards Social Reforms             :   Support for social reforms that challenged orthodox sections.
5.  Foreign Policy                             :   Conflicts with neighboring countries due to British expansionism.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly links British policies with their characteristics and consequences. Labour legislations (1), while introduced, were inadequate and did not prevent the continued exploitation of workers, especially in plantations. The British revenue policies (3) did indeed include the Izaredari system introduced by Warren Hastings. British foreign policy (5) is accurately reflected in the conflicts that arose from their expansionist ambitions.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they contain inaccuracies.  The British policy towards social reforms (4) was characterized by a withdrawal of support for those perceived as threatening to orthodox groups, not support for such reforms.  White racism (2) involved systematic exclusion from higher-grade services and other societal aspects, but its direct consequence was not the introduction of the Izaredari system.




**4. With reference to the British administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Administrative Feature                     Impact/Characteristic
1.  Indianisation of Services                 :   Indians held positions of control and authority.
2.  Relations with Princely States             :   Policy of annexation continued after 1857.
3.  Divide and Rule policy                     :  Played princes against states’ people.
4.  Hostility towards Educated Indians        :  Suppressed modern education movements.
5.  Restrictions on Freedom of Press           :   Repeal of the Vernacular Press Act in 1882.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) correctly identifies the accurate matches. The "Divide and Rule" policy (3) was characterized by pitting different groups against each other, including princes against the people. Hostility towards educated Indians (4) manifested in the suppression of educational and nationalist movements perceived as threats to British authority.

The other options are incorrect because of mismatched pairs. Indianisation of services (1) did not result in Indians holding all positions of control; key positions remained in British hands. The policy towards princely states (2) shifted after 1857 from annexation to a policy of maintaining them as a bulwark of the empire,  not a continuation of annexation. The Vernacular Press Act (5) was repealed in 1882 due to public pressure, not as a characteristic of the restrictions on press freedom, which were implemented through other means at various times.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Reform Movement                         Leader/Prominent Figure
1.  All India States' Peoples' Conference   :   Jawaharlal Nehru (President in 1939)
2.  Telangana Movement                     :   Indian National Congress
3.  Self-Respect Movement                 :   E.V. Ramaswami Naicker
4.  Khudai Khidmatgars                    :   Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan
5.  Indian National Congress                 :   A.O. Hume (founder)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately matches the reform movements with their leaders or prominent figures.  The All India States' Peoples' Conference (1) had Jawaharlal Nehru as its president in 1939. The Self-Respect Movement (3) was led by E.V. Ramaswami Naicker. The Khudai Khidmatgars (4) were associated with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. The Indian National Congress (5) was founded with the participation of A.O. Hume.

Option (b) is incorrect because while A.O. Hume played a significant role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, the Telangana Movement was not directly led by the Indian National Congress; it involved communist participation and opposition to the Congress.  The other options incorrectly exclude some of the correctly matched pairs.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

**1. Which among the following statements about Mahatma Gandhi’s Satyagraha is/are correct?**

1. It was during the course of his campaign against racialism in South Africa that Gandhiji first applied Satyagraha.
2. The two vital ingredients of Satyagraha are ‘truth’ and ‘non-violence’.
3. The Satyagrahi resists evil by inflicting suffering on himself and not by inflicting suffering on the opponent.
4. In India, Satyagraha was first tried by Gandhiji in Champaran.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 1 and 4
(b) Only 2
(c) Only 4
(d) All of these

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha.  Statement 1 is correct; Gandhi's experiences in South Africa fighting racial discrimination were pivotal in developing and implementing Satyagraha. Statement 2 is also correct;  'truth' (Satya) and 'non-violence' (Ahimsa) formed the core principles of Satyagraha. Statement 3 correctly reflects the philosophy of Satyagraha, emphasizing self-suffering as a means of resistance rather than inflicting harm on the opponent.  Finally, Statement 4 is accurate; the Champaran Satyagraha in Bihar marked Gandhi's first major application of Satyagraha in India.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all statements is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**2. Which one of the following pairs of organization and their founders is not correctly matched?**

(a) National Liberation Federation : Tej Bahadur Sapru and MR Jayakar
(b) Jamiat-ul Ulama-i Hind : Maulana Mehmood Hasan
(c) Congress Democratic Party : Bal Gangadhar Tilak
(d) Congress Socialist Party : MN Roy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Tej Bahadur Sapru and M.R. Jayakar were prominent leaders of the All India Liberal Federation, Maulana Mehmood Hasan was associated with Jamiat-ul Ulama-i Hind, and M.N. Roy was a founder of the Congress Socialist Party, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was not the founder of the Congress Democratic Party.  Therefore, option (c) is the incorrect pairing.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent accurate matches between the organizations and their prominent founders. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent Indian nationalist organizations and their leadership.


**3. Why was Vasudeo Balwant Phadke known in history?**

(a) He led a violent struggle against the British during the Revolt of 1857.
(b) He was a critic of Gandhian struggle.
(c) He led an armed uprising against the British in the 1870s.
(d) He was a radical leader of the Indian National Congress.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vasudeo Balwant Phadke is primarily remembered for leading an armed rebellion against the British in the 1870s.  He was not directly involved in the 1857 Revolt (a), nor was he a prominent critic of Gandhi (b) or a leader within the Indian National Congress (d). His armed struggle represents a significant, albeit less widely known, aspect of the Indian freedom struggle. The question assesses the candidate's awareness of lesser-known figures and movements within the broader context of Indian history.


**4. Which of the following statements about Bhagat Singh is/are not true?**

1. Bhagat Singh was influenced by socialist ideas.
2. He was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.
3. Bhagat Singh threw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929 with the objective to kill as many people as possible.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) Only 2
(d) Only 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate reflections of Bhagat Singh's life and ideology. He was deeply influenced by socialist thought and was a key member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While Bhagat Singh did throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly, his intention was not to kill as many people as possible; the bomb was designed to make a political statement, not to cause mass casualties.  Therefore, only statement 3 is untrue, making option (d) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly include statements that are factually correct.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of Bhagat Singh's ideology and actions, distinguishing between fact and misrepresentation.


**5. Which of the following statements about Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar is/are not correct?**

1. Vidyasagar’s writings significantly helped to develop the Bengali language.
2. He received the title ‘Vidyasagar’ from Presidency Sanskrit College, Calcutta.
3. He was enthusiastic about the spread of women’s education.
4. Vidyasagar defended widow remarriage without being convinced about scriptural support.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 2 and 4
(b) 1 and 2
(c) Only 4
(d) Only 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate depictions of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar's contributions. His writings significantly enriched the Bengali language, and he was a staunch advocate for women's education. However, statements 2 and 4 are not entirely correct. While he was a renowned scholar and teacher at Presidency College, Calcutta, the title 'Vidyasagar' was not conferred by the college itself.  Furthermore, while he championed widow remarriage, he did find scriptural support for his position, although his arguments were often based on social reform rather than purely religious grounds.  Therefore, options 2 and 4 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of a significant social reformer and challenges them to identify nuances in historical accounts.


**6. Which of the following statements about India’s Independence is/are correct?**

1. The formal transfer of power on 15th August 1947 heralding India’s Independence was announced by Lord Mountbatten.
2. Mahatma Gandhi was not present at the festivities in the capital on 15th August 1947.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are historically accurate. Lord Mountbatten, as the last Viceroy of India, formally announced the transfer of power on August 15, 1947, marking India's independence.  Mahatma Gandhi was indeed not present at the official independence celebrations in Delhi; he was in Calcutta, working towards peace and reconciliation amidst the escalating communal violence. Thus, option (c), which includes both 1 and 2, is the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key events surrounding India's independence and assesses their understanding of the historical context.



**UPSC Style MCQs on Polity and Governance (based on Target Content):**


**7. With reference to Gandhian philosophy, consider the following pairs:**

Concept                                        Description
1.  Truth (Satya)                               :   A principle separate from daily life and political action.
2.  Non-violence (Ahimsa)                     :   A strategy exclusively for mass movements.
3.  Sabarmati Ashram                           :   Established in 1916 for learning and practicing truth and non-violence.
4.  Champaran Satyagraha                       :   Gandhi's first experiment with Satyagraha in South Africa.
5.  Khadi                                      :   A symbol representing self-reliance and dignity of labour.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The Sabarmati Ashram was indeed established in 1916 as a center for Gandhi's followers to learn and practice his ideals of truth and non-violence. Khadi, the hand-spun cloth, became a powerful symbol of self-reliance and the dignity of labor in the Indian independence movement.  However, the other pairs are incorrectly matched. Truth (Satya) and non-violence (Ahimsa) were integral to Gandhi's daily life and political actions, not separate from them. Ahimsa was not limited to mass movements; it was a fundamental principle guiding all aspects of his philosophy. The Champaran Satyagraha was Gandhi's first major experiment with Satyagraha in India, not in South Africa.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer, highlighting the candidate's ability to discern accurate information from misleading options.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills.



**8. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

Movement/Event                                  Characteristic
1.  Rowlatt Act                                   :   Led to the formation of the Satyagraha Sabha.
2.  Non-Cooperation Movement                   :   Marked by widespread hartals and demonstrations.
3.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                    :   Triggered by the arrest of Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal.
4.  Khilafat Movement                           :   Primarily concerned with the post-World War I fate of the Ottoman Caliphate.
5.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms                 :   Introduced dyarchy in the provinces.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Rowlatt Act, which curtailed civil liberties, led to the formation of the Satyagraha Sabha as a means of resistance. The Non-Cooperation Movement was characterized by widespread hartals, strikes, and demonstrations across India. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was a direct consequence of the arrest of popular leaders Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal in Amritsar. The Khilafat Movement was indeed centered around the concern for the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I. Finally, the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms introduced the system of dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces.  Option (a) is the correct answer, demonstrating the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of key events and movements in the early Indian nationalist movement.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of historical context.


**9. With reference to the post-Non-Cooperation Movement period in India, consider the following pairs:**

Political Figure/Group                       Action/Stance
1.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru               :   Advocated entry into Legislative Councils.
2.  "No-changers"                             :   Opposed participation in Council elections.
3.  Swarajist Party                            :   Focused solely on constructive work, rejecting legislative politics.
4.  Bardoli Satyagraha                         :   Led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, demonstrating peasant resistance.
5.  Hindustan Republican Association           :   Initially focused on armed revolution before adopting socialist ideals.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru advocated for the entry of nationalists into legislative councils as a strategy to oppose British rule from within. The "No-changers" faction opposed this strategy, preferring to focus on mass movements outside the legislative framework. The Bardoli Satyagraha was indeed led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, showcasing the strength of peasant resistance. The Hindustan Republican Association, initially focused on armed revolution, later incorporated socialist ideals into its ideology.  However, the Swarajist Party did not solely focus on constructive work; they engaged in both legislative and non-legislative activities.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate descriptions of historical events and political figures. The question assesses factual recall and analytical capabilities.



**10.  With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following pairs:**

Issue                                          Gandhi's Stance                                    Bose's Stance
1.  Method of Struggle                        :   Complete reliance on non-violent resistance.                  Advocated for a combination of non-violent and violent methods, prioritizing the end goal.
2.  Economic Policy                           :   Emphasis on decentralized, village-based economy.              Advocated for rapid industrialization and state-controlled economy.
3.  Role of Women                            :   Women primarily as homemakers and caretakers.                 Women should have equal rights and participate fully in public life.
4.  View on Religion                          :   All religions are paths to the same truth.                      Secular state with religious neutrality.
5.  View on the State                          :   Ideal state as stateless society, decentralized power.            Authoritarian state initially, transitioning to democracy later.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the contrasting ideologies of Gandhi and Bose. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violent resistance is well-known, while Bose believed in employing both non-violent and violent means to achieve independence.  Gandhi's vision emphasized a decentralized, village-based economy, contrasting with Bose's advocacy for rapid industrialization and a state-controlled economy.  Gandhi's views on women's roles were more traditional, while Bose championed full equality and participation for women in public life.  Both believed in religious tolerance, but Gandhi's approach was more inclusive of religion within the state, while Bose advocated for a secular state with religious neutrality.  Finally, Gandhi envisioned a stateless society, while Bose favored an initially authoritarian state as a necessary transition to democracy. Option (b) is thus correct, showcasing the candidate’s understanding of the nuanced differences between these two prominent leaders. The question tests conceptual understanding, analysis, and factual recall.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects of British rule in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                   Key Feature/Impact
1.  Divide and Rule Policy                     :   Created alliances with princes and Zamindars against nationalists
2.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878                :   Imposed restrictions on the Indian language press
3.  Indian Factory Act, 1881                  :   Primarily dealt with the problem of child labour aged 7-12
4.  Permanent Settlement (Zamindari System) :   Gave zamindars proprietary rights over their land

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The British "Divide and Rule" policy actively fostered divisions among various groups in Indian society to maintain their control.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to suppress criticism of the British Raj in the Indian vernacular press. The Indian Factory Act of 1881, while limited in scope, marked the beginning of labor legislation in India, focusing on child labor between the ages of 7 and 12. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, granted zamindars proprietary rights, significantly altering the land revenue system and creating a class of powerful landlords.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                             Characteristic
1.  Ryotwari System                           :   Settlement was made directly with individual cultivators
2.  Mahalwari System                          :   Village community was considered the owner of land
3.  Permanent Settlement (Zamindari System) :   Revenue was fixed at a very high rate, leading to zamindari takeovers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect characteristics of the respective British revenue systems in India.  The Ryotwari system involved direct settlement with individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries. The Mahalwari system recognized the village community as the collective owner of the land, with individual rights vested in cultivators. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming for stability, resulted in excessively high revenue demands that often led to zamindaris being taken over by the government due to non-payment. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy/Action                      Consequence/Impact
1.  Hostility towards educated Indians      :   Suppression of the nationalist movement's early growth
2.  Alliance with Zamindars and landlords  :   Created a counterweight against nationalist-minded intelligentsia
3.  Restrictions on freedom of the press    :   Limited the dissemination of nationalist ideas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately describe the consequences of British policies.  The British actively suppressed the emerging nationalist leadership, hindering the early growth of the movement.  By allying with conservative elements like Zamindars, the British created a bulwark against the nationalist intelligentsia.  Restrictions on the press, such as the Vernacular Press Act, effectively limited the spread of nationalist ideas and dissent. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to the British administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Viceroy             Significant Action/Policy
1.  Lord Cornwallis                       :   Introduction of the Ryotwari System
2.  Lord Curzon                           :   Partition of Bengal
3.  Lord Lytton                            :   Implementation of the Vernacular Press Act, 1878
4.  Lord Mountbatten                      :   Announcement of the Mountbatten Plan for Indian independence

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three

**Explanation:**

Three of the pairs are correctly matched. Lord Curzon is known for the Partition of Bengal (though he didn't implement it personally, his administration was pivotal to it). Lord Lytton implemented the Vernacular Press Act, and Lord Mountbatten is associated with the plan leading to Indian independence. However, Lord Cornwallis is associated with the Permanent Settlement (Zamindari System), not the Ryotwari System, which was primarily associated with Thomas Munro. Option (a), (b) and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Person                                   Role/Association
1.  Thomas Munro                           :   Ryotwari System
2.  Holt Mackenzie                         :   Mahalwari System
3.  Lord Cornwallis                         :   Permanent Settlement
4.  Warren Hastings                        :   Izaredari System (Farming System)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Thomas Munro is closely associated with the development and implementation of the Ryotwari system in Madras Presidency. Holt Mackenzie played a key role in the introduction of the Mahalwari system in North India. Lord Cornwallis is remembered for the Permanent Settlement (Zamindari System). Warren Hastings implemented the Izaredari system, a precursor to more formalized land revenue systems. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Movement Demand      Specific Policy Addressed
1.  Greater facilities for technical and higher education :  Development of agricultural banks
2.  Extension of medical and health facilities          :   Curtailment of powers of juries
3.  Development of agricultural banks                 :   Spread of primary education among masses
4.  Opposition to disarming the people                :   Development of irrigation for agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because early Indian nationalists did indeed oppose the British policy of disarming the Indian populace.  They argued that this distrust of the people prevented them from defending themselves and their country. The other pairings are incorrect.  The demand for greater facilities in technical and higher education was a separate goal, not directly linked to the development of agricultural banks. Similarly, improving healthcare wasn't explicitly tied to restricting jury powers. The development of agricultural banks aimed to alleviate peasant indebtedness, a separate issue from the promotion of primary education. Therefore, only the connection between opposition to disarming and the government's trust in the people is accurately matched.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the precise link between a specific nationalist demand and a corresponding British policy.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader    Specific Focus of Advocacy
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji          :   Advocacy for protection of tenants from zamindars
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale   :   Indianisation of higher administrative services
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak       :   Advocacy for the Age of Consent Bill
4.  Surendranath Banerjea   :  Reform of Civil Service regulations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent advocate for the Indianisation of higher administrative services, arguing for greater Indian representation in these roles.  Surendranath Banerjea similarly championed reform of the Civil Service regulations, advocating for changes to improve opportunities for Indians.  The other options are incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji was a significant figure in the early nationalist movement, his primary focus was on economic issues like the drain of wealth, not specifically tenant protection.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, although a powerful leader, notably *opposed* the Age of Consent Bill, highlighting the complexities and diverse viewpoints within the nationalist movement. The question tests factual recall and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate the specific focus of different early nationalist leaders.


**3. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                  Primary Goal
1.  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha      :   Advocacy for Dominion Status
2.  Bombay Presidency Association :   Reform of the Vernacular Press Act
3.  East India Association       :   Creating an All-India political organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. The Bombay Presidency Association was primarily concerned with critiquing administrative and legislative measures, and a key issue they addressed was the Vernacular Press Act which restricted freedom of the press. The other options are incorrect. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, while advocating for various reforms, did not primarily focus on Dominion Status; that demand emerged later in the movement. The East India Association, founded in London by Dadabhai Naoroji, aimed to influence British public opinion regarding India, not to directly create an all-India political organization (though it contributed to that broader goal).  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the roles and priorities of different early nationalist organizations.  The close but incorrect options test the candidate's ability to distinguish between related but distinct goals.


**4. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress President          Year of Presidency
1.  W. C. Bonnerjee            :   1886
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji            :   1886
3.  Badruddin Tyabji           :   1887


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only option (c) is correct. Badruddin Tyabji did preside over the Indian National Congress in 1887. The other options are incorrect. W. C. Bonnerjee presided over the inaugural session of the Congress in 1885, not 1886. Dadabhai Naoroji's presidency was in 1886, but the question incorrectly states he held the position in the following year. This question directly tests factual recall of specific historical data related to the Indian National Congress. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect years acts as a strong distractor, making simple guessing difficult and requiring precise knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Leader          Method of Political Work
1.  Moderates                    :   Advocacy of armed revolution
2.  Extremists                   :   Constitutional agitation
3.  Aurobindo Ghosh              :   Passive resistance and Swadeshi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Aurobindo Ghosh was indeed associated with passive resistance and the Swadeshi movement as a prominent figure among the Extremists.  The other options are incorrect. Moderates were known for constitutional agitation, not armed revolution.  Extremists, while advocating for more assertive methods than the Moderates, did not primarily focus on constitutional agitation; their methods included passive resistance and Swadeshi movements.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different approaches within the early Indian nationalist movement, requiring knowledge of the key strategies employed by Moderates and Extremists, and the specific contributions of a leading figure like Aurobindo Ghosh.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these differing approaches.


**1. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Leader(s)
1.  Bombay textile mill strike (1928)     :   Bhagat Singh
2.  Kakori conspiracy case (1925)         :   Chandra Shekhar Azad
3.  Chittagong armoury raid (1930)       :   Surya Sen
4.  Assassination of a British police officer:   Ram Prasad Bismil

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1928 Bombay textile mill strike was a major labour movement led by communists, not Bhagat Singh.  The Kakori conspiracy case involved Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan, among others; Chandra Shekhar Azad was a leader of the Hindustan Republican Association/Hindustan Socialist Republican Association but wasn't directly implicated in that specific event. The Chittagong armoury raid was indeed led by Surya Sen.  The assassination of the British police officer was carried out by Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev, not Ram Prasad Bismil. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to distinguish between individuals involved in various revolutionary activities during the Indian independence movement.  The distractors are carefully chosen to include prominent figures from the period, making the question challenging.


**2. With reference to early 20th-century Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Primary Goal
1.  Hindustan Republican Association        :   Establish Dominion Status
2.  Hindustan Socialist Republican Association:   Achieve Purna Swaraj
3.  Servants of India Society                 :   Promote social reform and self-governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Hindustan Republican Association, founded in 1924, aimed to overthrow British rule through armed revolution, not Dominion Status.  The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, formed in 1928, was a successor organization that adopted socialist ideals and aimed for complete independence (Purna Swaraj).  The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, focused on social reform and preparing Indians for self-governance through gradual constitutional means. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of revolutionary and nationalist groups in India, requiring knowledge of their differing aims and ideologies.  The inclusion of Dominion Status as a potential goal for the HRA acts as a strong distractor, testing deeper knowledge of the movement.



**3. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                           Location
1.  First session of the Indian National Congress:   Calcutta
2.  Lahore Congress Session (1929)                :   Allahabad
3.  Nehru Report drafting                             :   Poona


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay, not Calcutta.  The Lahore Congress Session of 1929 took place in Lahore, not Allahabad. The drafting of the Nehru Report occurred in a subcommittee meeting primarily convened in Delhi and then concluded in Poona. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question assesses factual recall of significant events in the Indian National Congress's history and their locations. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect locations for the first Congress session and the Lahore session increases the difficulty level and tests precise knowledge.


**4.  With reference to the revolutionary movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                                     Action/Association
1.  Bhagat Singh                               :   Led the Non-Cooperation Movement
2.  Chandra Shekhar Azad                     :   Associated with the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
3.  Subhash Chandra Bose                      :   Organised the Salt Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bhagat Singh was a key figure in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association and participated in revolutionary activities, but he did not lead the Non-Cooperation Movement. That movement was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi. Chandra Shekhar Azad was indeed a prominent leader of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Subhash Chandra Bose played a significant role in the Indian independence movement, but he was not directly involved in organizing the Salt Satyagraha; that was primarily Gandhi's initiative.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles played by key figures in both the mainstream nationalist movement and the revolutionary movements. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the roles of various leaders within the broader context of the freedom struggle.


**5. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                             Key Provision/Impact
1.  Indian Independence Act, 1947           :   Established separate electorates for Muslims
2.  Government of India Act, 1935           :   Introduced provincial autonomy
3.  Indian Councils Act, 1892               :   Granted complete independence to India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Independence Act, 1947, partitioned India into India and Pakistan, but it did not establish separate electorates; that was a feature of earlier acts. The Government of India Act, 1935, is correctly paired with the introduction of provincial autonomy. The Indian Councils Act, 1892, introduced some limited reforms, but it certainly did not grant complete independence to India. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key legislative acts during the British Raj and their impact on India's political landscape. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these acts and their specific provisions.  The inclusion of "complete independence" as a potential outcome of the 1892 Act is a strong distractor, designed to catch those with superficial knowledge of the topic.


**6. With reference to the post-independence period in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                     Position/Role
1.  C. Rajagopalachari                       :   First President of India
2.  Lord Mountbatten                          :   Governor-General of India
3.  Nathuram Godse                           :   Leader of the Communist Party of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

C. Rajagopalachari served as Governor-General of India after Lord Mountbatten, not as the first President.  Rajendra Prasad was the first President of India. Lord Mountbatten did serve as the first Governor-General of India.  Nathuram Godse was the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, not a leader of the Communist Party of India. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and roles in the immediate post-independence period.  The distractors are carefully designed to include prominent individuals, making it crucial for the candidate to have precise knowledge to answer correctly.  The inclusion of the Communist Party leader as a distractor adds complexity and tests broader political awareness.


**7. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Publication                                    Prominent Contributor
1.  Young India                               :   Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  India                                      :   Annie Besant
3.  Satya Prakash                               :   Karsondas Mulji


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Young India was primarily associated with Mahatma Gandhi, not Dadabhai Naoroji.  India, a journal published by the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, was indeed associated with Annie Besant's work. Karsondas Mulji did start the Satya Prakash to advocate widow remarriage.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of important publications associated with the early nationalist movement and their key contributors. The distractors are carefully chosen to include prominent figures and publications from the period.


**8. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Organization                          Promoter/Founder
1.  Widow Remarriage Association              :   Jotiba Phule
2.  All India Depressed Classes Federation     :   Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
3.  Self-Respect Movement                      :   Gopal Hari Deshmukh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vishnu Shastri Pundit founded the Widow Remarriage Association, not Jotiba Phule, although Phule was a strong advocate for widow remarriage. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar correctly founded the All India Depressed Classes Federation.  The Self-Respect Movement was promoted by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar"), not Gopal Hari Deshmukh.  Therefore, only pairs 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the social reform movements of the 19th century and their key figures.  The distractors cleverly mix up the leaders and their associated movements, requiring precise knowledge.  The inclusion of Gopal Hari Deshmukh, a prominent social reformer in Maharashtra, as a potential founder of the Self-Respect Movement adds to the question's difficulty.


**9. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of the Revolt                               Description
1.  Economic Exploitation                        :   The British introduced a system of land revenue that benefited only the wealthy
2.  Religious Grievances                         :   The introduction of the Enfield rifle cartridges greased with animal fat
3.  Political Discontent                         :   The annexation of Avadh by Lord Dalhousie


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Economic exploitation through British policies like the land revenue system and the destruction of traditional industries led to widespread poverty and resentment.  Religious grievances stemmed from the introduction of the Enfield rifle cartridges greased with animal fat, which offended both Hindu and Muslim sensibilities.  Political discontent was fueled by annexations like that of Avadh, which eroded the power and prestige of local rulers and created widespread resentment.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the multifaceted causes of the 1857 Revolt, requiring knowledge beyond the commonly known trigger of the greased cartridges.  The question's strength lies in its ability to test a nuanced understanding of the complex historical event.


**10. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Outcome                                     Description
1.  Chauri Chaura incident                         :   Led to the suspension of the movement
2.  Arrest of Ali Brothers                          :   Triggered widespread protests and demonstrations
3.  Arrival of the Prince of Wales in India       :   Marked the beginning of the movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police occurred, directly led Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. The arrest of the Ali brothers, prominent Muslim leaders involved in the Khilafat movement, did indeed trigger significant protests.  The arrival of the Prince of Wales was not the trigger for the movement's start; the movement had already begun.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key events and their consequences within the Non-Cooperation Movement. The distractors are carefully designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between cause and effect within the historical context.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                    Association/Organization
1. A. O. Hume                             :   Indian National Conference
2. Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee             :   President, First Session, Indian National Congress
3. Dadabhai Naoroji                        :   President, Indian National Congress (thrice)
4. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose : Architects of the Indian National Union


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885, and Dadabhai Naoroji served as its president on three separate occasions during the early years.  The text explicitly states these facts.  

Option (a) is incorrect because while A.O. Hume played a crucial role in the formation of the Indian National Congress,  he is not directly linked to the Indian National Conference in the way the question implies.  The text mentions the Indian National Conference as a precursor, but doesn't state Hume's direct involvement with it.

Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing.

Option (d) is incorrect because while Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose were significant leaders in the early nationalist movement and instrumental in establishing the Indian National Conference, the term "Architects of the Indian National Union" is inaccurate. The Indian National Union was a name used for the organization before it became the Indian National Congress. They were crucial in its precursor, not the Union itself.  The question requires precise matching.


**2. With reference to the early Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                      Advocated/Contributed To
1. Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, Dinshaw Wacha   :   Drain Theory
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                      :   Self-Government on the lines of Canada and Australia (1906)
3. Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale             :   Sharp Criticism of Government Policies
4.  Dadabhai Naoroji (1904)                    :   Self-Government on the lines of Canada and Australia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The text explicitly mentions Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, and Dinshaw Wacha as proponents of the Drain Theory, which analyzed the economic exploitation of India under British rule.  Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale are also explicitly cited for their sharp criticism of government policies.  The text also correctly notes Dadabhai Naoroji's advocacy for self-government on the lines of Canada and Australia in 1904.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of Dadabhai Naoroji's advocacy for self-government in 1904.

Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly excludes the correct pairing of Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale's criticism of government policies.

Option (d) is incorrect because it attributes the advocacy of self-government on the lines of Canada and Australia to Gokhale in 1906, which is a slight misrepresentation of the chronology. While Gokhale did advocate for this, the text places the advocacy in 1905 not 1906.  UPSC questions often test precise details.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early aims and objectives (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. To establish a unified nationalist movement across India, irrespective of religious or caste differences.
2. To primarily focus on social reforms and leave political matters to existing institutions.
3. To create a platform for presenting Indian demands to the British government and building a shared national identity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the aims and objectives of the early Indian National Congress as described in the text. The Congress aimed to unite diverse groups under a common nationalist banner and to articulate Indian demands to the British government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The early Congress did not primarily focus on social reforms; while social harmony was a goal, its primary focus was on political and economic demands and building a national movement for self-governance.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                            Key Provision/Impact
1. Indian Councils Act of 1861                   :   Established an Imperial Legislative Council
2. Indian Councils Act of 1892                   :   Introduced the principle of election for some council members
3. Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909                 :   Increased the number of elected members in councils, but with indirect elections and some reserved seats.
4. Government of India Act 1919 (Montford Reforms) : Introduced dyarchy at the provincial level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 established the Imperial Legislative Council; the Act of 1892 introduced a limited form of indirect elections; the Morley-Minto Reforms expanded representation but maintained indirect elections and reserved seats; and the Government of India Act of 1919 introduced the system of dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces.  The text supports all these points.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Aspect                                 Characteristic/Outcome
1.  Treaty of Sevres (May 1920)               :   Led to increased Muslim anger and strengthened support for Non-Cooperation
2.  Nagpur Session of the Congress (December 1920) :  Officially endorsed the Non-Cooperation program and changed the Congress goal to Swaraj
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident (February 1922)     :   Prompted Gandhi to withdraw the movement due to violence
4.  Gandhi's Arrest (March 1922)              :   Marked the end of the Non-Cooperation Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Treaty of Sevres angered Muslims and fueled their participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement. The Nagpur session formalized the movement and redefined Congress goals. The Chauri Chaura incident led to the movement's withdrawal.  However, Gandhi's arrest, while significant, did not *mark* the definitive end of the movement; the violence at Chauri Chaura was the primary catalyst for its cessation.  The question tests nuanced understanding of causation.  Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Group/Leader                 Action/Event
1. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA)    :   Kakori Conspiracy
2. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt        :   Bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly
3. Surya Sen                                  :   Chittagong Armoury Raid
4.  Chandrasekhar Azad                       :   Participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are accurately linked. The HRA was involved in the Kakori Conspiracy, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt in the Central Assembly bombing, and Surya Sen in the Chittagong Armoury Raid.  However, while Chandrasekhar Azad participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement, the question focuses on his revolutionary activities, and this participation is a less prominent aspect of his overall actions described in the text.  The question tests the ability to focus on the most relevant information within a larger context. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are the most precise matches.


**7.  With reference to the responses to the Simon Commission (1927), consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission was boycotted by the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Hindu Mahasabha.
2. The boycott united various Indian groups and parties, at least temporarily.
3.  The Simon Commission's report led directly to the granting of dominion status to India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The text clearly indicates that the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Hindu Mahasabha all boycotted the Simon Commission, and that this boycott fostered a temporary unity among these groups.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Simon Commission's report was a significant factor in the constitutional developments that followed but did not directly lead to the granting of dominion status.  Further negotiations and events were involved.  The question tests the understanding of cause-and-effect relationships and avoids simplistic interpretations.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader                 Major Contribution/Position
1.  Mahadev Govind Ranade                 :   Founded the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji                       :   Thrice President of the Indian National Congress
3.  W.C. Bonnerjee                        :   President of the First Session of the Indian National Congress
4.  A.O. Hume                              :   Founded the Bombay Presidency Association


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Dadabhai Naoroji was indeed thrice President of the Indian National Congress, and W.C. Bonnerjee presided over its first session. However, while Mahadev Govind Ranade was associated with the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the text doesn't explicitly state he *founded* it.  Similarly, A.O. Hume is not linked to the founding of the Bombay Presidency Association in the provided text. The question assesses the ability to distinguish between direct involvement and association.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-Non-Cooperation Movement Faction/Leader    Position/Action
1.  Swarajists (C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru)          :   Advocated entry into Legislative Councils
2.  No-Changers (Rajendra Prasad, Vallabhbhai Patel) :   Focused on constructive work and boycotted Councils
3.  M.N. Roy                                        :   Founded the Communist Party of India in Tashkent


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Swarajists advocated for participation in legislative councils, the No-Changers focused on constructive work and boycotted councils, and M.N. Roy is correctly identified as a founder of the Communist Party of India.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and their positions within the evolving political landscape.


**10. With reference to the early phases of the Indian trade union movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Leader                          Contribution/Action
1.  Narayan Meghajee Lokhande                 :   Founded the Bombay Mill and Millhands Association
2.  All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC)     :   Founded in 1920 with Lala Lajpat Rai as its first president
3.  N.M. Joshi                                  :   Led a major strike in Bombay Textile Mills in the late 1920s


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Narayan Meghajee Lokhande's association with the Bombay Mill and Millhands Association and the founding of the AITUC with Lala Lajpat Rai as the first president are both supported by the text.  However, the text attributes the major strike in the Bombay Textile Mills in the late 1920s to the Communist Party influence, not specifically to N.M. Joshi. The question tests the ability to differentiate between direct leadership and broader influence.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Institution           Location
1. Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College : Aligarh
2. Kashi Vidyapeeth                  : Varanasi
3. Gujarat Vidyapeeth                 : Ahmedabad
4. Jamia Millia Islamia                : Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, later renamed Aligarh Muslim University, was indeed established in Aligarh.  Kashi Vidyapeeth, a prominent nationalist institution, was founded in Varanasi.  Gujarat Vidyapeeth, another significant nationalist educational institution, was established in Ahmedabad by Mahatma Gandhi.  Jamia Millia Islamia, a central university, has its roots in Delhi. All four pairs represent correctly matched educational institutions with their respective locations.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of key educational institutions and their locations, a crucial aspect of understanding the socio-political landscape of India during the nationalist movement and beyond.  The inclusion of both nationalist and other institutions serves as a distractor, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Event                     Location
1. Battle of Plassey                    :  Murshidabad
2. Third Battle of Panipat             :  Panipat
3. Jallianwala Bagh Massacre          : Amritsar
4. Chauri Chaura Incident              : Gorakhpur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Battle of Plassey, a pivotal event in the British conquest of India, took place near Murshidabad in Bengal. The Third Battle of Panipat, a significant clash between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali, occurred at Panipat. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, a brutal event in the Indian independence movement, happened in Amritsar. The Chauri Chaura incident, which led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, took place in Chauri Chaura, near Gorakhpur. All four pairs are correctly matched, highlighting significant historical events and their precise locations. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of Indian history and geography.  The inclusion of events from different periods and regions adds to the question's difficulty, requiring precise factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                     Title/Position
1. Queen Victoria                     : Empress of India
2. Lord Curzon                         : Viceroy of India
3. Lord Bentinck                       : Governor-General of India
4. Lord Canning                        : Viceroy of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Queen Victoria formally assumed the title of Empress of India in 1876, reflecting the British assertion of paramount power over the Indian subcontinent. Lord Curzon served as Viceroy of India during a period of significant administrative reforms. Lord Bentinck served as Governor-General of India, implementing several social reforms. Lord Canning played a crucial role in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt, shaping British policy towards princely states. All four pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a sound understanding of key figures and their roles in the British Raj. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, requiring precise knowledge of individuals and their positions within the British administration in India. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall key figures and their roles in shaping British rule in India, demanding precise knowledge and highlighting the complexities of the British Raj.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper                          Editor/Prominent Figure
1. Kesari                              : Bal Gangadhar Tilak
2. Yugantar                            : Aurobindo Ghosh
3. Amrita Bazar Patrika               : Girish Chandra Ghosh
4. Deenbandhu                          : Narayan Meghajee Lokhande

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the editor of the influential Marathi newspaper *Kesari*. Aurobindo Ghosh was associated with the Bengali nationalist newspaper *Yugantar*.  Girish Chandra Ghosh was a prominent figure associated with *Amrita Bazar Patrika*. Narayan Meghajee Lokhande was the founder and editor of *Deenbandhu*, a newspaper focused on labor issues.  Each pair is correctly matched, demonstrating knowledge of significant newspapers and their key figures in the context of the Indian nationalist movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, testing detailed knowledge of the Indian press during the nationalist era and its role in shaping public opinion. The question assesses the candidate's awareness of the role of the press in shaping the Indian nationalist movement, requiring specific knowledge of newspapers and their prominent figures.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Rowlatt Act                          : Allowed detention without trial
2. Indian Councils Act of 1892        : Increased elected Indian representation (limited)
3. Government of India Act 1919       : Introduction of Dyarchy
4. Trade Union Act of 1926            : Recognized trade unions legally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act, enacted in 1919, was infamous for allowing the detention of individuals without trial, a significant curtailment of civil liberties. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 introduced some limited expansion of elected Indian representation in legislative councils. The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced the system of Dyarchy, dividing powers between elected Indian representatives and the British administration. The Trade Unions Act of 1926 granted legal recognition to trade unions in India. Each pair accurately reflects a key feature of the respective legislation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, requiring a precise understanding of the key features of various acts passed during the British Raj. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant legislation and their impact on the political and social landscape of India, demanding specific knowledge of historical laws and their provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Movement                       Founder/Key Figure
1. Brahmo Samaj                          :   Raja Ram Mohan Roy
2. Arya Samaj                             :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
3. Ramakrishna Mission                   :   Swami Vivekananda
4. Satyashodhak Samaj                    :   Jyotirao Phule
5. Prarthana Samaj                       :   Atmaram Pandurang

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy is widely recognized as the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, a significant socio-religious reform movement in 19th-century India.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati established the Arya Samaj, another influential reform movement focused on a return to Vedic principles. Swami Vivekananda, a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, founded the Ramakrishna Mission, which emphasized humanitarian work and social service. Jyotirao Phule, a social reformer from Maharashtra, founded the Satyashodhak Samaj to fight against caste discrimination and social injustice.  Atmaram Pandurang, with the help of Keshab Chandra Sen, founded the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay, promoting monotheism and social reform.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of key figures associated with major 19th-century Indian reform movements, a crucial aspect of understanding the socio-political landscape of the period.  The inclusion of multiple correctly matched pairs and plausible distractors increases the question's difficulty level, assessing the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and slightly altered information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement                 Focus/Objective
1. Young Bengal Movement                :   Promoting Western Education exclusively
2.  Aligarh Movement                     :   Reconciling Western science with Islamic teachings
3.  Dev Samaj                             :   Emphasis on social behaviour and rejection of Vedic authority
4.  Singh Sabha Movement                 :   Modern Western education for Sikhs and countering Christian missionary activities
5.  Theosophical Society                  :   Revival of Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, aimed to integrate Western scientific education with Islamic principles. The Singh Sabha Movement focused on providing modern Western education to Sikhs while countering the influence of Christian missionaries. The Theosophical Society advocated for the revival and strengthening of ancient religions like Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Young Bengal Movement, though influenced by Western thought, did not solely focus on Western education but also on radical social and political reform. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Dev Samaj, while emphasizing moral conduct, did not reject Vedic authority entirely but aimed at a synthesis of Vedic and modern thought. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pair (pair 1). Option (d) is incorrect as it includes two incorrect pairs (pairs 1 and 3). This question tests the understanding of various social and religious reform movements in British India, their goals, and the key figures associated with them.  The inclusion of both correct and slightly modified information in the pairs tests the examinee's ability to accurately recall and analyze the historical details.


**3. With reference to 19th-century Indian social reform movements, consider the following pairs:**

   Reformer                                 Key Reform Effort
1. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar              :   Establishment of the Servants of India Society
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                  :   Championing widow remarriage
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji                       :   Advocating for women's education and property rights
4. Raja Ram Mohan Roy                     :   Promoting the study of Sanskrit and Vedic philosophy
5.  Jyotirao Phule                          :   Establishing the Satyashodhak Samaj

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, though known for many contributions, is not directly associated with the establishment of the Servants of India Society; that was primarily Gokhale's work.  Dadabhai Naoroji, while a prominent nationalist, is most famously known for his economic critique of British rule, not specifically focused on women's rights. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's work did not focus primarily on promoting the study of Sanskrit and Vedic philosophy.  However, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's significant contribution was the movement for widow remarriage. Jyotirao Phule established the Satyashodhak Samaj to fight against caste discrimination and social injustice.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of Jyotirao Phule and the Satyashodhak Samaj. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of Gopal Krishna Gokhale and his reform efforts related to women's rights and education. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrect pairings for Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Raja Ram Mohan Roy. This question tests the ability to connect reformers with their specific contributions, demanding detailed knowledge of 19th-century Indian social reform movements.  The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the candidate's capacity for precise recall and analytical skills.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Religious Reform Movement              Central Tenet/Emphasis
1. Brahmo Samaj                          :   Strict adherence to Vedic rituals
2. Arya Samaj                             :   Monotheism and rejection of idolatry
3.  Ramakrishna Mission                   :   Universal brotherhood and acceptance of all religions
4.  Ahmadiyya Movement                   :   Rejection of the concept of Jihad
5.  Deoband Movement                     :   Emphasis on traditional Islamic education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Arya Samaj emphasized monotheism and the rejection of idolatry. The Ramakrishna Mission focused on universal brotherhood and the acceptance of all religions. The Ahmadiyya Movement promoted a liberal interpretation of Islam, rejecting the concept of jihad (holy war). The Deoband Movement focused on traditional Islamic education and scholarship. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Brahmo Samaj did not strictly adhere to Vedic rituals but emphasized reason and monotheism. Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pairs 4 and 5. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair 5. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the core tenets and philosophies of various religious reform movements in India during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The carefully designed distractors ensure that only candidates with a strong understanding of the subject can answer correctly.  The question's difficulty stems from the subtle differences in the options and the need for precise knowledge of each movement's central beliefs.

   Movement                                 Primary Goal
1.  Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Movement:  Promoting inter-caste marriages in Bengal
2.  Vaikom Satyagraha                      :   Securing temple entry for the lower castes in Kerala
3.  Self-Respect Movement                  :   Rejection of Brahminical religion and culture in South India
4.  Justice Movement                       :   Achieving political representation for non-Brahmins in Madras Presidency

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Vaikom Satyagraha focused on securing temple entry for lower castes in Kerala.  The Self-Respect Movement in South India aimed to reject Brahminical religion and culture. The Justice Movement in Madras Presidency fought for political representation for non-Brahmins.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the SNDP Movement primarily aimed at uplifting the Ezhava community in Kerala, not promoting inter-caste marriages in Bengal. Pair 5 is incorrect; the Aruvippuram Movement, initiated by Sree Narayana Guru, was not about establishing a new religion but about challenging caste discrimination through temple entry. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 4. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes two incorrectly matched pairs (pairs 1 and 5). This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of diverse social reform movements across different regions of India, highlighting their distinct goals and contexts. The distractors are carefully crafted to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding movements and their objectives.  The question demands both factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Movement/Organization

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  Mahatma Gandhi founded the All India Anti-Untouchability League in 1932 as part of his broader social reform agenda.  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, also known as Periyar, spearheaded the Self-Respect Movement in South India, challenging the caste system and advocating for social justice for the marginalized. Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 to carry on the work of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, focusing on humanitarian service and spiritual teachings. Dadabhai Naoroji founded the East India Association in London in 1866 to advocate for Indian interests in Britain. Jyotirao Phule, a prominent social reformer from Maharashtra, established the Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth-Seekers' Society) in 1873 to fight against caste discrimination and social inequality.  These individuals played pivotal roles in shaping social and political reform movements in India, each with distinct approaches and goals.  Therefore, all five pairs are accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                     Year
1.  Rowlatt Act                   :   1921
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre    :   1919
3.  Champaran Satyagraha        :   1917

(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in 1919, the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917, and Gandhi returned to India in 1915.  The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, not 1921, and the Non-Cooperation Movement launched in 1920.  The other options are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched years for the Rowlatt Act and the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This question tests the examinee's knowledge of key events and their chronological order within the Indian Nationalist Movement, requiring precise factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer              Key Contribution
1.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy         :   Founded the Arya Samaj
2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati   :   Authored Satyarth Prakash
3.  Keshab Chandra Sen         :   Led the Prarthana Samaj

(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored the Satyarth Prakash, a key text of the Arya Samaj. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar actively championed the cause of widow remarriage in Bengal. The other pairs are incorrect: Raja Ram Mohan Roy founded the Brahmo Samaj, not the Arya Samaj; Keshab Chandra Sen was associated with the Brahmo Samaj, not the Prarthana Samaj; and Jyotirao Phule established the Satyashodhak Samaj, not the Brahmo Samaj. This question tests the understanding of the contributions of various social reformers, demanding accurate association of individuals with their specific works and movements. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the depth of knowledge.


**4. With reference to early 20th-century Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper/Publication       Prominent Figure Associated
1.  Kesari                       :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Aurobindo Ghosh was prominently associated with the Yugantar, a revolutionary nationalist newspaper. Surendranath Banerjea was a key figure associated with the Amrita Bazar Patrika. Annie Besant was a prominent editor and contributor to The Hindu newspaper.  The other pairs are incorrect: Kesari was associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak, not Gopal Krishna Gokhale; and Rast Goftar was associated with the Parsi reform movement, not Dadabhai Naoroji, although he was involved in various publications. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the media landscape of the early 20th century and its connection to prominent nationalist figures. The inclusion of plausible distractors makes the question challenging.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Movement          Key Goal/Characteristic
1.  All India Trade Union Congress:   Initially influenced by British Labour Party ideals
2.  Servants of India Society      :   Focused on training national missionaries
3.  Ahmadiyya Movement            :   Advocated for jihad against foreign rule
4.  Deoband Movement              :   Emphasized a return to pure Islamic teachings
5.  Singh Sabha Movement          :   Primarily concerned with political activism

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), in its early years, was significantly influenced by the social democratic ideas of the British Labour Party. The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, aimed to train selfless workers dedicated to national service. The Deoband Movement focused on religious revivalism and a return to pure Islamic teachings.  The other pairs are incorrect: The Ahmadiyya Movement, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, explicitly opposed jihad; and the Singh Sabha Movement primarily focused on religious and educational reform among Sikhs, not direct political activism. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of various organizations and movements, their objectives, and their ideological influences, requiring careful analysis and differentiation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pre-Congress Nationalist Organization     Prominent Leader
1. British India Association                  :     Dadabhai Naoroji
2. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha                 :     Gopal Krishna Gokhale
3. Indian Association of Calcutta           :     Surendranath Banerjea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The British India Association was formed through the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society in 1851. While Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent figure in the Indian National Movement and later became President of the Indian National Congress, he wasn't directly associated with the leadership of the British India Association.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, founded in the 1870s, was significantly shaped by the leadership and intellectual contributions of Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent member and later leader, making option 2 correct. The Indian Association of Calcutta, established in 1876, had Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose as its key founders and leaders, making option 3 correct.  Option 1 is incorrect because Dadabhai Naoroji's primary leadership role was with the East India Association in London and the Indian National Congress. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of pre-Congress nationalist organizations and their key figures, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Organization Aim        Description
1. Madras Native Association            :    Advocated for the reform of administration
2. Bombay Association                  :    Focused primarily on the spread of education
3. East India Association (London)      :    Influenced British public opinion on Indian welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association were both established in 1852.  While both organizations worked towards improving Indian administration and expanding education, their primary focus wasn't solely on one aspect. The Madras Native Association primarily focused on administrative reforms and representation of Indians in the administration, making option 1 correct. The Bombay Association, while concerned with education, also addressed administrative issues. The East India Association, founded by Dadabhai Naoroji in London in 1866, explicitly aimed to influence British public opinion to promote Indian welfare, making option 3 correct. Option 2 is incorrect because the Bombay Association's objectives were broader than solely focusing on education. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly includes option 2. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the diverse aims of early nationalist organizations and their strategies in interacting with the British government.


**3. With reference to the early Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Leader                       Political Stance
1. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                   :   Extremist
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                       :   Moderate
3. Dadabhai Naoroji                          :   Moderate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Dadabhai Naoroji were prominent leaders of the Moderate faction within the early Indian National Congress, advocating for constitutional methods and gradual reforms within the existing framework of British rule.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, however, was a leader of the Extremist faction, advocating for more assertive and radical methods, including Swadeshi and Boycott movements.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect because Gokhale was a Moderate. Option 2 is incorrect because Tilak was an Extremist. Option 3 is correct because Dadabhai Naoroji was indeed a Moderate. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the different ideological factions within the early nationalist movement and their respective approaches to achieving self-rule.


**4.  With reference to the pre-independence era, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                            Primary Objective
1. Vernacular Press Act, 1878             :   Promote Indian language newspapers
2. Indian Councils Act of 1892             :   Expand Indian representation in legislative councils
3. Indian Official Secrets Act, 1904       :   Restrict freedom of the press

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was enacted by Lord Lytton's government to curb the growing influence of vernacular newspapers critical of British rule.  Its primary aim was to control and restrict, not promote, the Indian press, making option 1 incorrect.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 aimed to expand Indian representation in legislative councils, albeit with limited powers, making option 2 correct. The Indian Official Secrets Act of 1904 was designed to further restrict the freedom of the press by limiting access to and publication of government information, making option 3 correct. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the British government's legislative strategies in response to the growing nationalist movement, highlighting the tension between freedom of expression and colonial control.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reform Movement                   Prominent Figure
1. Brahmo Samaj                           :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
2. Arya Samaj                             :   Raja Ram Mohan Roy
3. Self-Respect Movement                  :   E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Raja Ram Mohan Roy was the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, a significant religious and social reform movement that advocated for monotheism and social reform in the early 19th century, making option 1 incorrect and option 2 incorrect.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, another major religious and social reform movement that emphasized Vedic principles and social reform in the late 19th century.  E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker, also known as Periyar, led the Self-Respect Movement in South India, advocating for social justice and equality for non-Brahmins, making option 3 correct. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of prominent social reform movements in India and their founders.  Understanding the distinctions between these movements is crucial for analyzing the socio-religious landscape of the pre-independence era.


**1. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   **Perspective/Leader**                     **Advocated Strategy**
1. M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai  :   Resumption of Civil Disobedience Movement
2. Jawaharlal Nehru                         :   Constructive work along Gandhian lines
3.  Gandhi                                  :   Constitutional struggle and participation in elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly outlines the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Congress.  Option (c) is correct because Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance and the working of the 1935 Act, advocating for a continued focus on constructive work and later, reluctantly, accepting council entry as a short-term tactical strategy.  Option (a) is incorrect as M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections, not the immediate resumption of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Option (b) is incorrect because Nehru was critical of both constructive work and council entry as substitutes for mass struggle, advocating instead for the continuation of non-constitutional mass action. The incorrect options highlight the complexities and diverse viewpoints within the Congress regarding the most effective approach to achieving independence.  Understanding these differing strategies is crucial for grasping the dynamics of the Indian independence movement.  The question tests the ability to analyze different perspectives within a historical context, demanding careful reading and differentiation of nuanced positions.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   **Feature of the Act**                     **Description**
1. Federal Level: Executive                 :   Governor-General acted solely based on the advice of elected ministers.
2. Provincial Autonomy                     :   Dyarchy continued in provinces.
3. Federal Legislature                       :   Council of States had members elected indirectly.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The Government of India Act, 1935, established a complex system of governance. Option (d) is the correct answer because: 1. The Governor-General had both reserved and transferred subjects, meaning he didn't solely rely on elected ministers’ advice. 2. Provincial autonomy *replaced* dyarchy. 3. The Council of States had a mix of directly elected members from British Indian provinces and nominated members from princely states.  The incorrect options test the candidate's understanding of the intricate details of the 1935 Act, which is a critical element of the Indian independence movement's history and evolution of governance. The question assesses the ability to accurately recall and analyze the specifics of a significant historical document, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge in understanding the complexities of Indian constitutional history.


**3. With reference to the first General Elections in India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Act/Legislation**                         **Key Provision**
1. Representation of the People Act, 1950 :   Defined the conduct of elections, poll expenses, and counting of votes.
2. Representation of the People Act, 1951 :   Specified voter qualifications and electoral roll preparation.
3. The Constitution of India               :   Established the Election Commission.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct as the Representation of the People Act, 1951, detailed voter qualifications and electoral roll preparation, and the Constitution of India established the Election Commission. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because the Representation of the People Act, 1950, focused on voter qualifications and electoral rolls, while the Representation of the People Act, 1951, dealt with election conduct and vote counting. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the legislative framework surrounding India's first general elections, a significant event in the establishment of India's democracy.  The distractors test the ability to differentiate between similar pieces of legislation and their specific provisions, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the electoral process in India's early years.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Political Party**                         **Founding Leader/Prominent Figure**
1. Praja Socialist Party (PSP)               :   Jayaprakash Narayan
2. Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS)              :   Syama Prasad Mukherjee
3. Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM):   Ajoy Ghosh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Syama Prasad Mukherjee founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and Ajoy Ghosh was a prominent figure in the formation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).  Jayaprakash Narayan was associated with the Socialist Party and the Praja Socialist Party, but he wasn't the sole founding leader. The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of the political landscape of post-independent India, testing their knowledge of key political parties and their leaders. The distractors test the candidate’s ability to distinguish between individuals associated with parties and their actual founders, a crucial aspect of understanding the political evolution of India. The question evaluates the candidate's ability to recall and associate key figures with their respective political organizations.


**5. With reference to the challenges faced by newly independent India, consider the following pairs:**

  **Challenge**                                   **Related Issue/Event**
1. Territorial integration                     :   The Radcliffe Line and communal riots
2. Refugee resettlement                       :   The Delhi Pact on Minorities
3. Communist insurgency                      :   Telangana Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Radcliffe Line and communal riots were directly linked to territorial integration challenges.  The Delhi Pact aimed to address the refugee crisis caused by partition. The Telangana Movement was a manifestation of the communist insurgency.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the multifaceted challenges India faced during its initial years as an independent nation. This requires an understanding of the socio-political context and the interconnectedness of various events and issues.  The question assesses the ability to connect major events with broader challenges, indicating a holistic understanding of the historical period.


**1. With reference to the socio-political landscape of Princely States during British rule, consider the following pairs:**

    Issue                                      Affected Group
    1. Excessive land revenue and taxation   :   Peasants
    2. Serfdom and forced labour           :   Princes
    3. Restrictions on freedom of the press  :   Artisans
    4. Lack of education and social services :   Zamindars


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that appalling economic conditions prevailed in princely states, characterized by excessive and unbearable land revenue and taxation, directly impacting the peasantry.  This establishes the correct matching of pair 1.  The text also highlights the backwardness of education and other social services, again affecting the overall population, including the zamindars who, while holding power, still lacked access to these essential services and were also affected by this. Hence, pair 4 is correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While serfdom and forced labour existed in some princely states, the passage doesn't directly link these practices to the princes themselves as the primary affected group. The princes were more likely the beneficiaries of these systems rather than the direct victims.  Pair 3 is also incorrect. The passage mentions restrictions on the freedom of the press as a general condition, not specifically targeting artisans.  The restrictions affected a broader spectrum of society, including those who might express dissent against the ruling powers. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to discern precise information from broader contextual details.  The question's difficulty stems from the subtle nuances in the text and the presence of plausible but incorrect options.


**2. With reference to the growth of communalism in India during the pre-independence era, consider the following pairs:**

    Political Entity                     Characteristic
    1. Muslim League                      :   Advocated for joint electorates
    2. Hindu Mahasabha                   :   Rejected the two-nation theory
    3. All India States’ Peoples’ Conference :   Supported the partition of India
    4. Indian National Congress            :   Won a significant number of Muslim-reserved seats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The Muslim League, under Jinnah's leadership, vehemently opposed joint electorates and actively championed the two-nation theory, leading to the demand for Pakistan. The Hindu Mahasabha, while communal, did ultimately accept the two-nation theory, mirroring the Muslim League's separatist ideology. The All India States' Peoples' Conference, focused on the princely states, did not directly support the partition of India; its primary concern was democratic reforms within those states.  Finally, the Indian National Congress, despite its efforts, did not win a significant number of Muslim-reserved seats, contributing to the growing rift between the Congress and the Muslim League. The question's difficulty arises from the need to accurately recall the stances of various political entities during a period marked by complex political maneuvering and shifting alliances. The options test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the historical context and the nuances of the various political actors involved.


**3. With reference to the Princely States and the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

    Year                                   Event
    1. 1927                               :   Chamber of Princes created
    2. 1935                               :   All India States’ Peoples’ Conference founded
    3. 1938                               :   Congress goal of independence included princely states' independence
    4. 1939                               :   Jawaharlal Nehru became President of the All India States’ Peoples’ Conference


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Indian National Congress explicitly included the independence of princely states in its definition of independence in 1938, demonstrating a shift towards actively addressing the political situation in these regions.  Jawaharlal Nehru's appointment as President of the All India States' Peoples' Conference in 1939 further solidified the Congress's involvement in the movement for democratic rights within the princely states.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes was established in 1921, not 1927. This was a crucial body created by the British to consolidate their influence over the princely rulers and counter the growing nationalist movement. Pair 2 is also incorrect. The All India States’ Peoples’ Conference was founded in December 1927, not 1935.  This organization played a significant role in coordinating political activities within the princely states and advocating for self-governance.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key dates and events related to the Indian National Congress and the Princely States. The carefully selected distractors make the question challenging, demanding precise historical recall.


**4. With reference to the economic policies of the British in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Revenue System                        Key Feature
    1. Permanent Settlement               :   Revenue directly collected from ryots
    2. Ryotwari System                     :   Fixed revenue for 30 years
    3. Mahalwari System                    :   Revenue collected through village headmen
    4. Izaredari System                    :   Land revenue fixed permanently


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, did indeed involve the permanent fixing of land revenue, making it a defining characteristic of this system.  The Izaredari system, an earlier revenue system, also involved a fixed land revenue, though not permanently; it was initially for five years, later annual.

The Ryotwari system, while collecting revenue directly from ryots, did not have a fixed revenue for 30 years; the revenue could be revised periodically. The Mahalwari system, though collecting revenue through village headmen, did not have a fixed revenue for 30 years as it was periodically revised. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nuances of different land revenue systems implemented by the British in India.  The distractors are carefully chosen to highlight the complexities and variations within these systems. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key features of each system, demanding a high degree of factual recall and analytical ability.


**5.  With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Leader                                    Ideology/Approach
    1. Dadabhai Naoroji                       :   Extremist Nationalism
    2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                 :   Moderate Nationalism
    3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                    :   Constitutional Agitation
    4. Aurobindo Ghose                        :   Passive Resistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale is correctly paired with Moderate Nationalism; he was a prominent leader of the Moderate faction within the Indian National Congress, advocating for constitutional means of achieving political reforms.  Aurobindo Ghose, while initially a moderate, later became associated with the more militant nationalist movement and advocated for passive resistance, making pair 4 correct.

Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent early nationalist leader but is incorrectly linked with Extremist Nationalism; while he was a strong critic of British rule, he primarily advocated constitutional methods. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a key figure in the Extremist movement, is incorrectly paired with Constitutional Agitation; while he did engage in constitutional politics at times, his ideology and methods were significantly more radical than mere constitutional agitation.  This question aims to test the candidate's understanding of the different factions and approaches within the early nationalist movement. The distractors are carefully designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge of the personalities and their respective ideologies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Leader
1. Champaran Satyagraha                  :     Rajendra Prasad
2. Ahmedabad Mill Strike                 :     Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
3. Kheda Satyagraha                      :     Anusuya Sarabhai

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Champaran Satyagraha (1917), Gandhi's first major Satyagraha in India, saw the significant participation of Rajendra Prasad, who assisted Gandhi in investigating the plight of indigo farmers and negotiating with the authorities.  While other leaders like Mazhar-ul-Haq and J.B. Kripalani also played roles, Rajendra Prasad's involvement was crucial in the movement's success.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) primarily involved Mahatma Gandhi's direct intervention through a fast-unto-death to secure a wage increase for the mill workers. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's major contribution came later, during the Kheda Satyagraha. Anusuya Sarabhai, a prominent social worker, played a key role in the Ahmedabad Mill Strike, acting as a bridge between Gandhi and the workers, and mobilizing support for the strike.  Her involvement, however, wasn't a leadership role in the same way as Gandhi's. The Kheda Satyagraha (1918) was largely led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who organized the peasant resistance against revenue demands during a period of crop failure. Therefore, only the pairing of Champaran Satyagraha with Rajendra Prasad is accurately matched.  The other options incorrectly attribute leadership roles to individuals whose contributions were significant but secondary to the primary leaders of those movements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                              Key Feature
1. Rowlatt Act                               :   Allowed for trials without juries
2. Government of India Act, 1919           :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces
3. Government of India Act, 1935           :   Established an All-India Federation (never implemented)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act of 1919 was indeed infamous for its provisions allowing trials without juries and imprisonment without trial, severely curtailing civil liberties.  The Government of India Act, 1919 (also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms), introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces, dividing subjects into 'reserved' and 'transferred' categories, a significant step towards limited self-governance.  Although the Government of India Act, 1935, envisioned an All-India Federation incorporating both British Indian provinces and princely states, this aspect of the Act never materialized due to the non-cooperation of princely states. The Act's key feature, however, remained the proposal for the federation.  All three pairs accurately reflect key features of the respective acts/legislation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the historical context of these acts and their impact on the Indian political landscape is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of India's struggle for independence.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                                    Central Theme/Focus
1. Non-Cooperation Movement                      :   Complete Independence
2. Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34)       :   Salt Satyagraha
3. Quit India Movement                             :   Immediate end of British rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Non-Cooperation Movement initially aimed at non-violent non-cooperation with the British, its ultimate goal was not explicitly defined as complete independence at its outset, although this became a more prominent theme later. The 1930-34 Civil Disobedience Movement, however, is indelibly linked to the Salt Satyagraha, which symbolized the defiance of British laws and became a pivotal moment in the movement. The Quit India Movement of 1942 explicitly demanded the immediate end of British rule in India, making it a direct call for independence amidst World War II.  Therefore, the pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Non-Cooperation Movement's central theme is not solely complete independence in its initial phase. Option (b) is incorrect as it misses the crucial link between the Quit India Movement and its demand for immediate independence. Option (d) is incorrect because the Non-Cooperation Movement's central theme wasn't exclusively complete independence in its early stages.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform/Act                                       Prominent Advocate/Influencer
1. Abolition of Sati                               :    Raja Ram Mohan Roy
2. Widow Remarriage Act                           :    Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
3.  Gurudwara Reform Movement                    :     Master Tara Singh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a prominent figure in the movement to abolish Sati (the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husband's funeral pyres), actively campaigning against it and contributing significantly to its eventual banning. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a crucial role in advocating for the Widow Remarriage Act, actively working to change social attitudes and legal frameworks surrounding widow remarriage. Master Tara Singh was a prominent leader of the Gurdwara Reform Movement, a significant religious and political movement aimed at reforming the administration of Sikh shrines and asserting the rights of Sikhs. All three pairs accurately connect the reform/act with a key figure associated with its advocacy or leadership.  The other options are incorrect because they inaccurately exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs. Understanding the contributions of these individuals to social and religious reform is essential for a comprehensive understanding of 19th and 20th-century India.


**5. With reference to early Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                     Political Stance/Approach
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                           :   Extremist
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                     :   Moderate
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                       :   Moderate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, while a prominent early nationalist leader, is primarily associated with the Moderate faction of the Indian National Congress. His emphasis on constitutional methods and appeals to British justice align with the Moderate approach. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a leading figure among the Moderates, known for his belief in gradual reforms and constitutional means of achieving self-government. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, on the other hand, is recognized as a key leader of the Extremist faction, advocating for more assertive and radical methods of achieving Swaraj. Thus, only the pairing of Gopal Krishna Gokhale with the Moderate stance is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either incorrectly classify Dadabhai Naoroji or Bal Gangadhar Tilak or both.  The distinction between Moderate and Extremist factions within early Indian nationalism is a crucial aspect of understanding the evolution of the movement's strategies and ideologies.


**6. With reference to the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement                                    Key Characteristic/Event
1. Non-Cooperation Movement                :   Salt Satyagraha
2. Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34) :   Dandi March
3. Quit India Movement                       :   Arrest of Gandhi and other Congress leaders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, while encompassing various forms of non-violent resistance, did not centrally feature the Salt Satyagraha. The Salt Satyagraha was the defining event of the Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34), beginning with the Dandi March. The Quit India Movement was immediately followed by the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and numerous other Congress leaders, marking a decisive turning point in the movement's trajectory. Therefore, only the pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate the Salt Satyagraha with the Non-Cooperation Movement or exclude the immediate arrest of Congress leaders following the Quit India Resolution.  Understanding the chronology and key events of these movements is crucial for a nuanced understanding of India's struggle for independence.


**7. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                     Primary Aim/Consequence
1. Permanent Settlement                         :   Strengthening Zamindari system
2. Ryotwari System                              :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators
3. Vernacular Press Act, 1878                  :   Promoting Indian language press

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, aimed to establish a stable revenue system by granting Zamindars proprietary rights over their lands.  This significantly strengthened the Zamindari system, although it also had unintended consequences like the impoverishment of peasants. The Ryotwari System, introduced in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed at direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries like Zamindars. The Vernacular Press Act, 1878, enacted by Lord Lytton, aimed to curb the freedom of the Indian language press, which was seen as a threat to British rule, not promoting it.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the accurate pairing of the Ryotwari System. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the accurate pairing of the Permanent Settlement. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of the Vernacular Press Act.  Understanding the impact of these British revenue and press policies is crucial for analyzing the socio-economic and political dynamics of colonial India.


**8. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following pairs:**

   Leader/Figure                                    Role/Association
1. Subhas Chandra Bose                         :   Formed the INA
2. Rash Behari Bose                             :   Assisted Subhas Chandra Bose in the INA
3. Mohan Singh                                 :   Initially involved in INA formation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose is undeniably recognized as the leader who spearheaded the formation and mobilization of the Indian National Army (INA), giving it a powerful nationalist impetus. Rash Behari Bose, a veteran revolutionary, played a crucial role in assisting Subhas Chandra Bose in organizing and leading the INA, particularly in its early stages.  Mohan Singh, an officer in the British Indian Army, was initially involved in the formation of the INA before Subhas Chandra Bose took over its leadership.  All three pairs accurately reflect the roles and associations of these individuals with the INA. The other options are incorrect because they inaccurately exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the leadership and organizational aspects of the INA is crucial for assessing its impact on the Indian independence movement and its implications for the Indian Army.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual/Organization       Contribution/Association
    1. Sayyid Ahmad Khan          :  Authored "Gift to Monotheists"
    2. Dadabhai Naoroji            :  Professor of Gujarati, University College, London
    3. Muhammad Iqbal             :  Promoted Kesari
    4. Naoroji Furdonji             :  Leader of the Aligarh School

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji did indeed work as a Professor of Gujarati at University College, London.  The other options are incorrect. Sayyid Ahmad Khan is known for his reformist work and the Aligarh Movement, but he didn't author "Gift to Monotheists"—that was written by Rammohun Roy.  Muhammad Iqbal was a renowned poet and philosopher, but he wasn't associated with the publication *Kesari*; that was associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  Naoroji Furdonji was involved in Parsi religious reform, but he wasn't a leader of the Aligarh School; that group included figures like Chiragh Ali and Altaf Husain Hali. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related historical figures and their contributions, a crucial skill in UPSC preparation. The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each individual's actual achievements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Reform Movement          Primary Goal/Focus
    1. Akali Movement          :  Purification of Gurudwara management
    2. Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha :  Modernization of Parsi social customs
    3. Aligarh Movement        :  Raising women's status in society

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Akali Movement primarily aimed at purifying the management of Sikh gurudwaras, which had fallen under the control of corrupt mahants.  The Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha, a Parsi religious reform association, focused on modernizing Parsi social customs, particularly concerning women's education and social status.  However, while Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist zeal did include advocating for raising the status of women, the Aligarh Movement's primary focus wasn't solely on this; it encompassed broader educational and social reform within the Muslim community. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the goals of various 19th-century Indian reform movements. The inclusion of a partially correct pair (3) increases the question's difficulty and necessitates a thorough understanding of the movements’ nuances.


**3. With reference to 19th-century Indian education, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                      Key Provision/Characteristic
    1. Charter Act of 1813           :  Established the first three universities in India
    2. Wood's Despatch (1854)      :  Advocated for the Downward Filtration Theory
    3. Macaulay's Minute (1835)    :  Emphasized Western learning through English
    4. Hunter Commission (1882-83) :  Focused primarily on higher education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Macaulay's Minute of 1835 definitively shifted the focus of British educational policy in India towards Western learning, advocating for English as the medium of instruction.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated funds for the promotion of education but didn't establish universities; those came later. Wood's Despatch of 1854 aimed to expand education but didn't advocate for the Downward Filtration Theory; that was a consequence of earlier policies. The Hunter Commission's focus was primarily on primary and secondary education, not higher education.  This question tests knowledge of key educational policies and their characteristics, requiring an understanding of the nuances of British educational reforms in India.  The distractors are designed to challenge assumptions about the impact and content of these policies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual/Group          Known for/Associated with
    1.  Lokahitawadi             :  Championed widow remarriage in Maharashtra
    2.  Jotiba Phule              :  Founded the Widow Remarriage Association
    3.  Karsondas Mulji          :  Advocated for Parsi legal reforms for women
    4.  Dadabhai Naoroji         :  Published *Satya Prakash*


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Karsondas Mulji was indeed a prominent figure in advocating for Parsi legal reforms that improved the legal status of women. The other pairs are incorrect.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi) was a social reformer in Maharashtra, but his primary focus wasn't widow remarriage; he advocated for broader social and political reforms. Jotiba Phule was a significant social reformer who worked for the upliftment of lower castes and women but didn't found the Widow Remarriage Association; that was founded by Vishnu Shastri Pundit.  Dadabhai Naoroji was involved in Parsi social reform but didn't publish *Satya Prakash*; that was published by Karsondas Mulji. This question tests the ability to connect social reformers with their specific contributions and to distinguish between their individual roles within the broader context of 19th-century social reform movements in India.  The distractors are designed to be plausible and require precise knowledge of the individuals and their actions.


**5. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Revenue System           Principal Characteristic
    1. Permanent Settlement   :  Direct collection from ryots
    2. Ryotwari System        :  Fixed revenue for zamindars
    3. Mahalwari System       :  Revenue assessed on village communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Mahalwari system indeed involved revenue assessment based on the collective responsibility of village communities. The other options are incorrect. The Permanent Settlement fixed revenue for zamindars, not for ryots (who were tenants). The Ryotwari System involved direct collection from ryots, not fixed revenue for zamindars. This question tests factual knowledge of British land revenue systems in India and their distinctive features. The distractors exploit common misconceptions and require precise knowledge of the differences between these systems to answer correctly.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the complexities of British revenue policies and their impact on Indian agrarian society.  The use of plausible distractors requires a nuanced understanding of the subject matter.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Polity and Governance within the context of the Indian freedom struggle.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Demand                     Specific Policy/Action Addressed
1. Greater access to higher education         :   Development of agricultural banks
2.  Protection of Indian workers abroad      :   Curtailment of powers of juries
3.  Improvement of the police system        :   Extension of irrigation facilities
4.  Defence of freedom of speech and press  :   Official policy of disarming the people


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the early nationalists directly addressed the issues of protecting Indian workers facing oppression abroad (primarily in South Africa, as highlighted by Gandhi's struggle) and defending the freedoms of speech and the press against government restrictions.  The other options incorrectly link demands to unrelated policies.  Option 1 wrongly connects greater access to higher education with the development of agricultural banks – while both were advocated, they weren't directly linked in terms of addressing a specific policy. Option 3 incorrectly pairs police system improvement with irrigation expansion.  Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the mismatched pairs. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring students to identify the precise links between the demands and the corresponding government policies being challenged.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Goal                      Specific Method Employed
1.  Arousing political consciousness       :   Sending deputations to Britain
2.  Persuading the British Government     :   Constitutional agitation within the law
3.  Educating British Public Opinion        :   Organizing big meetings and demonstrations
4.  Building strong public opinion in India :   Active propaganda in Britain


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies the methods employed by moderate nationalists.  Sending deputations to Britain and carrying out active propaganda there were key strategies to influence British public opinion. Constitutional agitation (petitions, meetings, resolutions) aimed to persuade the government. Building a strong public opinion within India was a primary goal achieved through various methods, including public meetings. Option 3 incorrectly links educating British public opinion with mass demonstrations – the former was a more targeted approach.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and include the incorrect pairing of method 3.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various methods of political action.


**3. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Specific Nationalist Demand                   Associated Leader/Organization
1.  Indianisation of higher administrative services  :   Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
2.  Reform of Civil Service regulations            :   Indian Association of Calcutta
3.  Larger share in Legislative Councils             :   Dadabhai Naoroji
4.  Protection of tenants from zamindar oppression :   British India Association


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Association of Calcutta actively campaigned for civil service reforms. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent leader, championed increased Indian representation in legislative councils. The demand for Indianizing higher administrative services was a central theme of early nationalism. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, while influential, wasn't primarily associated with this specific demand, although it did contribute to the broader nationalist movement. The British India Association primarily focused on landlord interests and wasn't the leading voice for tenant protection.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pairs.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the different organizations and their roles in the early nationalist movement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Policy/Action                   Early Nationalist Response
1. Annexation of Avadh                        :   Widespread resentment and rebellion
2.  Ilbert Bill                               :   Organized all-India campaign in support
3.  Vernacular Press Act                     :   Agitation for constitutional reforms
4.  Removal of import duties on British textiles:   Creation of the Indian National Congress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The annexation of Awadh fueled widespread resentment within the sepoys and the broader populace. The Ilbert Bill controversy, marked by racial discrimination, prompted a nation-wide campaign in support of the bill. The Vernacular Press Act, designed to suppress criticism, triggered strong opposition from nationalists. The removal of import duties was a factor contributing to broader discontent but didn't directly cause the creation of the Indian National Congress, which was a culmination of various factors. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of an incorrectly paired statement.  This question assesses the ability to connect government policies with the corresponding responses of the early nationalists, testing factual knowledge and analytical skills.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Newspaper                      Region of Publication
1.  The Hindu                               :   Bombay
2.  The Bengalee                             :   Madras
3.  The Tribune                              :   Punjab
4.  The Mahratta                             :   Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Tribune was published in the Punjab, and The Bengalee was published in Bengal. The Hindu was published in Madras. The Mahratta was published in Bombay. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Options (a) and (d) include incorrectly paired newspapers and their regions. This question tests factual recall and the ability to accurately match newspapers with their places of publication, highlighting the geographical spread of nationalist sentiment.  The distractors are carefully chosen to make the question challenging.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader              Significant Contribution/Demand
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                    :   Advocated for "Swarajya" (self-government) within the British Empire
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale               :   Authored the official history of the Indian National Congress
3. Surendranath Banerjea              :   Established the Servants of India Society
4. Pherozeshah Mehta                   :   First woman graduate of Calcutta University to address a Congress session

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent early nationalist leader who significantly advocated for "Swarajya" or self-government within the framework of the British Empire.  His contribution to the economic critique of British imperialism, particularly the "drain of wealth" theory, is also well-known.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, another key figure, did not author the official history of the Indian National Congress; that was Pattabhi Sitaramayya.  Surendranath Banerjea was a powerful orator and played a crucial role in the early nationalist movement, notably in founding the Indian Association. Finally,  Kadambini Ganguli, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University, addressed a Congress session, not Pherozeshah Mehta. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly associate individuals with achievements or roles they did not hold.  Understanding the contributions of these leaders is crucial for grasping the evolution of the Indian nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Key Characteristic/Leader
1. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha              :   Founded by Justice Ranade and others
2. Bombay Presidency Association       :   Established in 1885
3. East India Association (London)      :   Founded by A. O. Hume
4. Madras Mahajan Sabha                :   Established in 1876

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was indeed founded by Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade and other prominent figures in the 1870s.  It played a vital role in shaping public opinion and advocating for reforms. The Bombay Presidency Association was established in 1885, serving as a significant platform for nationalist activities in the region. The East India Association in London was founded by Dadabhai Naoroji, not A. O. Hume.  A.O. Hume's role was primarily in the establishment of the Indian National Congress.  The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in 1881, not 1876.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect the organizations and their characteristics or founding dates. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about these early nationalist organizations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Congress President             Year of Presidency (First Term)
1. Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee          :   1889
2. Dadabhai Naoroji                     :   1886
3. Badruddin Tyabji                     :   1887


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee presided over the inaugural session of the Indian National Congress in 1885, not 1889.  Dadabhai Naoroji's first term as Congress President was in 1886. Badruddin Tyabji's first presidency was indeed in 1887.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect years associated with the presidencies of these early Congress leaders.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the early leadership and chronology of the Indian National Congress, a crucial element in understanding the movement's initial phases.


**4. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1892, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision of the Act                 Consequence/Impact
1. Increased number of council members :   Led to complete satisfaction among nationalists
2. Some members indirectly elected     :   Introduced the principle of representation
3. Officials retained their majority     :   Nationalists declared the act a "hoax"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did increase the number of members in both the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils. However, this expansion did not lead to complete satisfaction among Indian nationalists; their dissatisfaction stemmed from the continued dominance of officials.  The Act did introduce the principle of representation, albeit indirectly, through elected members nominated by various bodies. The fact that officials retained their majority in the councils was a major source of frustration for the nationalists, leading them to view the act as inadequate and a "hoax." Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately represent the provisions of the Act and their consequences.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Act did not lead to complete satisfaction among nationalists.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Early Nationalist Leader             Key Economic Idea/Policy
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                    :   Advocated for swadeshi (use of Indian goods)
2. R.C. Dutt                           :   Proposed tariff protection for Indian industries
3. Dinshaw Wacha                      :   Developed the "drain of wealth" theory


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, a pioneer of Indian nationalism, strongly advocated for swadeshi, emphasizing the importance of supporting Indian-made goods to bolster the national economy.  R.C. Dutt, another significant figure, was a proponent of tariff protection for Indian industries, arguing that it was essential for fostering their growth and competitiveness against British imports.  The "drain of wealth" theory, which highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, is primarily associated with Dadabhai Naoroji, not Dinshaw Wacha, although Wacha was a prominent early nationalist who contributed to the economic critique of British rule.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect the economic ideas and policies advocated by these early nationalist leaders.  Understanding these economic perspectives is critical to comprehending the broader context of the Indian nationalist struggle.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Indian independence movement.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Key Figure/Organization
1.  Formation of the Azad Hind Fauj          :   Rash Behari Bose
2.  Quit India Resolution                     :   All India Congress Committee (AICC)
3.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                        :    Lord Irwin
4.  Shimla Conference                         :    Lord Wavell
5.  Cabinet Mission                          :   Clement Attlee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Rash Behari Bose played a significant role in the initial stages of the Indian National Army (INA) before Subhas Chandra Bose took over. The Quit India Resolution was indeed passed by the AICC. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was a landmark agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin. Lord Wavell convened the Shimla Conference.  Finally, the Cabinet Mission was sent to India under the leadership of Clement Attlee's Labour government.  The options are designed to test the candidate's comprehensive understanding of key figures and events of this period.  Incorrect options strategically omit key individuals or events to create plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to the transfer of power in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Proposal/Plan                                 Prominent Feature
1. Cripps Mission                              :   Offered Dominion Status with the option of secession for provinces.
2. Wavell Plan                                 :   Proposed an Executive Council with equal Hindu and Muslim representation.
3. Cabinet Mission Plan                        :   Suggested a three-tier structure with grouping of provinces.
4.  Mountbatten Plan                           :  Partition of India into India and Pakistan.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the core features of the respective proposals and plans.  The Cripps Mission famously offered Dominion Status, but the option for provinces to secede proved controversial. The Wavell Plan aimed for parity between Hindus and Muslims in the Executive Council. The Cabinet Mission proposed a complex three-tier structure and the grouping of provinces.  Finally, the Mountbatten Plan formalized the partition of India.  The distractor options strategically omit one or more of these crucial elements, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the historical context.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                      Associated Ideology/Movement
1.  Subhas Chandra Bose                 :   Forward Bloc
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                     :   Congress Socialism
3.  M.N. Roy                               :   Communist Party of India (CPI)
4.  Bhagat Singh                          :   Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links the political figure with their significant association. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc. Jawaharlal Nehru is strongly associated with the development of Congress Socialism. M.N. Roy was a key figure in the formation of the CPI. Bhagat Singh was a prominent member of the HSRA.  The incorrect options systematically exclude one or more correct pairings, challenging the candidate's ability to differentiate between various personalities and their ideologies during a complex period of Indian history.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the political landscape.



**4. With reference to the Indian Independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

  Event/Movement                      Key Demand/Outcome
1.  Non-Cooperation Movement           :   Boycott of British goods and institutions.
2.  Salt Satyagraha                      :   Civil Disobedience against Salt Tax.
3.  Quit India Movement                   :   Immediate end of British rule.
4.  Royal Indian Navy (RIN) Revolt        :   Equal pay for Indian and British sailors.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall of major movements and their central demands.  The Non-Cooperation Movement involved widespread boycotts. The Salt Satyagraha directly challenged the British salt tax. The Quit India Movement demanded immediate independence. The RIN revolt included demands for equal pay and highlighted racial discrimination within the armed forces.  All pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the only correct option. The incorrect options progressively omit correct pairings, testing the candidate’s knowledge of the key events of the Indian independence struggle.  The question also assesses the candidate's understanding of the evolution of the movement's tactics and goals.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Legislation                          Significant Impact/Provision
1.  Government of India Act, 1919        :   Introduced Dyarchy in provinces.
2.  Government of India Act, 1935        :   Established Provincial Autonomy.
3.  Indian Independence Act, 1947       :   Partition of India.
4.  Communal Award, 1932               :   Separate electorates for certain communities.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of Dyarchy.  The Government of India Act, 1935, is notable for establishing Provincial Autonomy. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, legally partitioned India. The Communal Award of 1932 established separate electorates for various religious communities.  The incorrect options are designed to assess the candidate’s knowledge of significant legislative acts during the period leading to Indian independence.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the historical impact of these acts.  Option (d) serves as a strong distractor for those unsure of the details.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Policy in India                     Associated Feature
1. Divide and Rule                           :   Promoting religious and caste conflicts
2. Hostility towards Educated Indians      :   Restricting access to higher administrative positions
3. Alliance with Zamindars and Landlords  :   Protecting their interests at the expense of peasants
4.  Revenue Policies                          :   Implementation of Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems
5.  Labour Legislations                      :   Initially focusing on child labor in factories, neglecting plantation workers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The British "Divide and Rule" policy actively fostered discord between different religious and caste groups to maintain their control. Their hostility towards educated Indians stemmed from a fear of the emerging nationalist leadership, leading to restrictions on their access to higher administrative positions. The British sought alliances with Zamindars and Landlords, bolstering their power and neglecting the plight of the peasantry.  The British implemented various revenue systems like the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari, which had significant impacts on land ownership and revenue collection. Lastly, the initial focus of British labour legislation was primarily on child labor in factories, while largely ignoring the exploitative conditions faced by workers on plantations.  These policies reflect the multifaceted nature of British colonial rule in India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude crucial elements of British policy in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   British Administrative Policy                 Result
1.  Vernacular Press Act of 1878             :   Increased freedom of the Indian press
2.  Introduction of Dyarchy                  :   Division of central legislature into two houses
3.  Policy of Subordinate Union with Princely States :   Complete British control over princely states' internal affairs
4.  Restrictions on Freedom of the Press      :   Repealed under public protest in 1882
5.  White Racism                              :   Systematic exclusion of Indians from higher-grade services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The policy of "Subordinate Union" with princely states resulted in the British government exercising paramountcy, effectively controlling their internal affairs.  White racism was a significant feature of British rule, manifesting in the systematic exclusion of Indians from higher-grade services, both civil and military.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to restrict, not increase, the freedom of the Indian press. Dyarchy referred to the division of subjects in provincial governments, not the central legislature.  The restrictions on the freedom of the press, implemented through acts like the Vernacular Press Act, were indeed met with public protest and eventually repealed in some cases, but the initial intention was to curb press freedom.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 accurately reflect the consequences of specific British policies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System in British India              Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement                     :   Direct revenue collection from ryots
2. Ryotwari System                           :   Land ownership vested in zamindars
3. Mahalwari System                          :   Revenue assessment based on village communities
4. Hastings’ System                          :   Revenue collection through contractors
5.  Ryotwari System                          :   High revenue rates leading to peasant indebtedness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Mahalwari system indeed involved revenue assessment based on village communities.  Hastings' system used revenue farmers or contractors for collection. The Ryotwari system, while not always resulting in direct collection from every single ryot, often led to high revenue rates and significant peasant indebtedness.  The Permanent Settlement vested land ownership in Zamindars, not ryots.  The Ryotwari system did not vest land ownership in Zamindars. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 accurately describe the characteristics of the respective revenue systems.


**4. With reference to the British Colonial Rule in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                     Impact
1. First Burmese War (1824-26)            :   Expansion of British influence in South-East Asia
2.  War with Nepal (1814-16)               :   Acquisition of hill stations like Simla and Mussoorie
3.  Annexation of Burma                     :  Conquest through three successive wars
4.  British Foreign Policy in India           :   Protection of the Indian empire and expansion of British commercial interests
5.  Indian Factory Act of 1881               :   Regulation of working conditions in British-owned tea plantations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The First Burmese War expanded British influence in Southeast Asia.  The War with Nepal led to the acquisition of territories including sites for hill stations like Simla and Mussoorie. Burma's annexation was achieved through three successive wars. British foreign policy in India prioritized the protection of the Indian empire and the expansion of British commercial interests. However, the Indian Factory Act of 1881 did *not* regulate working conditions in British-owned tea plantations; those were largely left unregulated despite the miserable conditions. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



**5. With reference to the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                   Key Contribution
1.  Gokhale                                :   Advocated for militant nationalism
2.  Tilak                                   :   Supported the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
3.  Aurobindo Ghose                         :   Openly declared the goal of "Political Freedom"
4.  Gandhi                                 :   Introduced Satyagraha as a method of struggle
5.  Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Declared the goal of "self-government" or Swaraj


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Tilak was a key figure in the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement. Aurobindo Ghose explicitly advocated for political freedom.  Gandhi introduced Satyagraha. Dadabhai Naoroji declared self-government or Swaraj as the goal.  However, Gokhale is known for his moderate approach and advocacy of constitutional means, not militant nationalism. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are accurately paired.


**6.  With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Publication            Key Figure/Characteristic
1.  Indian National Congress            :   Initially focused solely on militant tactics
2.  Amrita Bazar Patrika                :   Published articles criticizing the government's actions
3.  The Indian Association             :   Founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose
4.  Moderates                            :   Advocated for constitutional methods of achieving self-government
5.  Extremists                           :   Rejected constitutional methods and favored more radical approaches


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) Only one
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Amrita Bazar Patrika was indeed a newspaper that published critical articles against the British government. The Indian Association was founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose.  The Moderates, during the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement, primarily advocated for constitutional methods to achieve self-government. The Indian National Congress, in its early years, did not focus *solely* on militant tactics; it initially adopted a moderate approach. While some extremists existed, the characterization of the INC as solely focused on militant tactics is incorrect for this period. The description of Extremists is accurate. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately represent the early phases of the Indian nationalist movement.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                       Primary Aim
1.  Rowlatt Act                             :   Protect civil liberties
2.  Indian Councils Act of 1909            :   Expand Indian participation in government
3.  Government of India Act 1935           :   Establish a federal structure in India
4.  Indian Factory Act of 1891             :   Improve working conditions for women and children
5.  Vernacular Press Act of 1878           :   Restrict Indian-language press


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Government of India Act of 1935 aimed to establish a federal structure. The Indian Factory Act of 1891 focused on improving working conditions for women and children (though inadequately). The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to restrict the Indian-language press. The Rowlatt Act aimed to curb dissent and civil liberties, not protect them. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 did expand Indian participation in government, but it was limited and indirect.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the primary aims of the legislation.


**8. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-1922), consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Action                         Characteristic
1.  Lucknow Pact (1916)                  :   Marked a decline in Hindu-Muslim cooperation
2.  Chauri Chaura Incident                 :   Led to the withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement
3.  Treaty of Sevres (1920)                :   Favourable to the aspirations of Indian Muslims
4.  Nagpur Congress Session (1920)       :   Congress adopted the goal of Swaraj
5.  Boycott of Foreign Cloth              :   Aimed at promoting Swadeshi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Chauri Chaura incident directly led Gandhi to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement due to its violent nature. The Nagpur Congress session of 1920 formally adopted the goal of Swaraj as the Congress's aim. The boycott of foreign cloth was a key element of the movement, aimed at promoting Swadeshi (self-reliance). The Lucknow Pact of 1916 strengthened Hindu-Muslim cooperation, not weakened it. The Treaty of Sevres was deeply unfavorable to the aspirations of Indian Muslims, sparking outrage and contributing to the Khilafat movement. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the events and characteristics of the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan.


**1. With reference to the Cripps Mission and the Quit India Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Key Figure/Event Detail
1.  Cripps Mission Failure                 : Immediate transfer of power to Indians demanded by Congress
2.  Quit India Resolution                  : Passed at Bombay on August 8, 1942
3.  Gandhi's "Do or Die" Mantra           :  Advocated complete freedom immediately
4.  Post-Quit India Repression              :  Mass arrests of Congress leaders on August 9, 1942
5.  Azad Hind Fauj (INA) formation       : Subhas Chandra Bose


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Cripps Mission failed primarily because the British refused to grant the Congress's demand for the immediate transfer of effective power to Indians.  The Quit India Resolution, a landmark event in India's struggle for independence, was indeed passed in Bombay on August 8, 1942. Gandhi's famous "Do or Die" mantra, delivered on the night of August 8, 1942, unequivocally called for complete and immediate freedom. The British responded to the Quit India Movement with a brutal crackdown, arresting key Congress leaders early on August 9, 1942.  Finally, Subhas Chandra Bose played a pivotal role in forming the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) in Southeast Asia during World War II. These facts are well-established historical events.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all five correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement following the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Perspective/Strategy                                   Prominent Advocate
1.  Constructive work on Gandhian lines                 :  M.A. Ansari
2.  Constitutional struggle and participation in elections :  Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  Resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle      :  Gandhi
4.  Struggle-Truce-Struggle (S-T-S) strategy             :  Subhas Chandra Bose


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. While Gandhi championed constructive work, it wasn't his sole post-CDM strategy; he also considered constitutional means.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, S. Satyamurthy, and B.C. Roy advocated constitutional struggle and electoral participation. Jawaharlal Nehru, however, was strongly critical of both constructive work and council entry as alternatives to mass struggle.  He favored a continuous, non-constitutionalist approach. The Struggle-Truce-Struggle (S-T-S) strategy was indeed advocated by a large number of Congressmen led by Gandhi, but Subhas Bose was among those who opposed it, favoring a continuous confrontation with imperialism. Therefore, only the statement relating to the resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle under Gandhi's advocacy is accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatches in the advocated strategies and their proponents.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                             Feature
1.  All India Federation                            :  Never fully implemented due to princely states' non-participation
2.  Federal Legislature (Federal Assembly)          :  Partially indirectly elected from British Indian provinces
3.  Provincial Autonomy                             :  Replaced dyarchy in provinces
4.  Communal Electorates                            :  Further extended under the Act
5.  Governor's Special Responsibilities                : Granted extensive powers to provincial governors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. The proposed All-India Federation, a key feature, never materialized due to the failure of princely states to meet the conditions for joining. The Federal Assembly, the lower house of the federal legislature, was indeed partially indirectly elected. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier diarchy system.  The Act unfortunately further extended the system of communal electorates, exacerbating existing divisions.  Finally, the Act granted significant special responsibilities to governors, allowing them to intervene in provincial administration in various situations.  Therefore, option (d) which includes all correctly matched pairs is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Location/Event                                      Significant Aspect
1.  Dandi March                                     :  Gandhi's symbolic salt law violation
2.  Dharasana Salt Satyagraha                       :  Brutal lathi charge on peaceful protestors
3.  Sholapur                                        :  Fiercest response to Gandhi's arrest
4.  Kheda District, Gujarat                          :  Determined no-tax movement
5.  Chittagong Armoury Raid                          :  Surya Sen's leadership


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe aspects of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The Dandi March, a pivotal event, symbolized the defiance of the salt tax and British authority. The Dharasana Salt Satyagraha was marked by a brutal police lathi charge against peaceful protestors, highlighting the government's repressive tactics. Sholapur witnessed one of the most violent and widespread responses to Gandhi's arrest. Kheda District in Gujarat experienced a resolute no-tax movement.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid was indeed led by Surya Sen, demonstrating the militant strand within the movement. Therefore, option (d) is the correct option as all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Round Table Conferences and the Communal Award, consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Group                                         Role/Stance
1.  Gandhi                                            :  Sole Congress representative at the Second Round Table Conference
2.  B.R. Ambedkar                                     :  Advocated for separate electorates for depressed classes
3.  Communal Award                                   :  Established separate electorates for various minority groups
4.  Poona Pact                                         :  Abolished separate electorates for depressed classes
5.  Ramsay MacDonald                                 :  Announced the Communal Award


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Gandhi represented the Congress at the Second Round Table Conference. B.R. Ambedkar was a strong advocate for separate electorates for the depressed classes. The Communal Award, announced by the British government, did establish separate electorates for various minority groups. The Poona Pact, negotiated between Gandhi and Ambedkar, led to the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes.  Finally, Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister at the time, was the one who announced the Communal Award. Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all statements are factually accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to the post-World War II national scenario, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                                     Characteristic Feature
1.  Royal Indian Navy (RIN) Revolt                     :  Protested racial discrimination and INA trials
2.  INA Release Movement                            :  Widespread participation across various social groups
3.  Cabinet Mission Plan                              :  Proposed a three-tier executive and legislature
4.  Constituent Assembly                             :  Elected by provincial assemblies using proportional representation
5.  Objectives Resolution                             :  Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect events and features of the post-World War II national scenario in India. The RIN revolt, a significant event, protested against racial discrimination, poor conditions, and the ongoing INA trials. The INA release movement was indeed characterized by widespread participation across diverse social groups. The Cabinet Mission Plan did propose a three-tiered structure for the Indian executive and legislature. The Constituent Assembly was elected by provincial assemblies using proportional representation, a significant aspect of its formation. Finally, Jawaharlal Nehru drafted the Objectives Resolution, a key document outlining the aims of the Constituent Assembly. Option (d), therefore, is the correct answer as all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to the debates on future strategies after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Perspective                                      Prominent Advocate(s)
1. Constructive work on Gandhian lines           :   Jawaharlal Nehru
2. Constitutional struggle and participation in elections :   M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai
3. Resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle :   S. Satyamurthy, B.C. Roy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly outlines three perspectives following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Option (b) correctly identifies that M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections.  The text explicitly names these individuals as proponents of this approach.  Option (a) is incorrect because while Gandhi's philosophy underpinned constructive work, the text does not explicitly state Nehru as a primary advocate of this immediate post-CDM strategy.  Option (c) is also incorrect because, although Nehru was critical of both constructive work and council entry, he didn't advocate for the immediate resumption of the Civil Disobedience Movement as the sole path forward.  His vision was more nuanced, involving class-based organization and a long-term strategy of continuous confrontation with imperialism, not a direct return to mass civil disobedience. Option (d) incorrectly combines two partially correct statements, making it an overall incorrect choice. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between different perspectives within the nationalist movement and accurately associate them with their respective proponents. It also highlights the complexities and internal debates within the Congress during this crucial period.  The specific names of individuals are important for demonstrating detailed knowledge of the historical context.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                         Description
1. All India Federation                         :   Came into effect immediately upon passage of the Act
2. Federal Legislature                           :   Comprised a unicameral structure with a Federal Assembly
3. Provincial Autonomy                          :   Replaced dyarchy with complete provincial autonomy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details the key features of the Government of India Act, 1935. Option (c) is correct because the Act replaced dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces with complete provincial autonomy. This was a significant constitutional change. Option (a) is incorrect because the proposed All-India Federation, a key element of the Act, never materialized due to the non-fulfillment of conditions related to the princely states' participation. Option (b) is incorrect as the Act established a bicameral legislature at the federal level, consisting of both the Council of States (upper house) and the Federal Assembly (lower house). The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the structural aspects of the 1935 Act and its impact on the Indian political landscape.  The specific details regarding the failure of the federation and the bicameral nature of the legislature demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Act's complexities and limitations.  This is a crucial aspect of Indian constitutional history and requires detailed knowledge beyond simple recall.


**3. With reference to the Nehru Report, consider the following pairs:**

   Recommendation                                 Detail
1. Complete Independence for India              :   Explicitly stated as the primary goal
2. Joint electorates for minority representation :   Rejected separate electorates for all minorities
3. Dominion Status                               :   Proposed as a transitional phase before complete independence

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage mentions the Nehru Report and its recommendations. Option (b) is correct because the report advocated for joint electorates, rejecting separate electorates for minorities.  This is a crucial aspect of the report's approach to minority representation and its impact on the subsequent political discourse. Option (a) is incorrect as the Nehru Report did not advocate for complete independence; instead, it proposed dominion status. Option (c) is incorrect because, while the report did propose dominion status, it was not presented as a transitional phase towards complete independence, but rather as the primary goal. The option plays with the chronology and the intent to mislead the candidate.  Option (d) combines two partially correct but ultimately inaccurate statements, testing for precise understanding of the report's content. The question demands precise knowledge of the Nehru Report's core recommendations, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between the report's actual proposals and commonly held misconceptions about its contents.  The nuanced understanding of minority representation within the context of the report is vital for a comprehensive understanding of Indian constitutional history.


**4. With reference to the 1937 provincial elections, consider the following pairs:**

   Province                                       Outcome
1. Bengal                                         :   Congress won a clear majority
2. United Provinces                               :   Congress formed a government
3. North-West Frontier Province (NWFP)         :   Congress emerged as the single largest party

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes the results of the 1937 provincial elections. Option (d) is correct because the Congress formed governments in the United Provinces and emerged as the largest party in the NWFP, although it did not secure a majority.  This highlights the complex political dynamics of the time. Option (a) is incorrect as Congress did not win a clear majority in Bengal; it was the largest party but did not have a majority. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuanced results of the 1937 elections and the formation of Congress ministries in different provinces, showcasing the uneven nature of Congress dominance across India. The details regarding the majority status versus the largest party status are important for demonstrating precise knowledge.  The ability to differentiate between these scenarios is crucial for accurate historical analysis.


**5. With reference to the individuals involved in the debates surrounding office acceptance in 1937, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                                      Stance on Office Acceptance
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                               :   Supported office acceptance as a strategic tool
2. Subhash Bose                                   :   Opposed office acceptance
3. Gandhi                                         :   Initially opposed, later gave conditional approval

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes the differing opinions within the Congress regarding office acceptance in 1937. Option (d) correctly identifies that Subhash Bose opposed office acceptance, while Gandhi initially opposed but later conditionally approved it.  This reflects the ideological divisions within the Congress. Option (a) is incorrect because Nehru, along with other leftists, vehemently opposed office acceptance, viewing it as a compromise with the colonial system. The question evaluates the candidate's understanding of the differing viewpoints on office acceptance and the evolution of Gandhi's position. The nuanced understanding of the ideological positions and their implications for the national movement is crucial for demonstrating a deeper grasp of the historical context.  The specific positions of key leaders highlight the complexities of decision-making within the Congress.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                      Prominent Feature/Person Associated
1. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Introduction of Provincial Autonomy
2. Cripps Mission                               :   Proposed Dominion Status for India
3. Simon Commission                           :   Recommended responsible government in provinces
4. Nehru Report                                 :   Advocated complete independence for India
5.  Quit India Movement                        :   Slogan "Do or Die"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 is correctly paired with the introduction of provincial autonomy, a key feature of the Act that replaced dyarchy.  The Cripps Mission, while aiming for self-government, proposed Dominion Status as an interim step before independence, making option 2 correct.  The Simon Commission's recommendations did *not* include the replacement of dyarchy with responsible government in the provinces; this was a later development.  Therefore, option 3 is incorrect. The Nehru Report, while advocating for a dominion status initially, did not ultimately recommend complete independence; hence, option 4 is incorrect.  The Quit India Movement is correctly linked to Gandhi's "Do or Die" slogan, making option 5 correct.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Session/Event                                  Key Decision/Outcome
1. Lahore Congress Session, 1929             :   Declaration of Purna Swaraj
2. Haripura Congress Session, 1938            :   Election of Subhas Chandra Bose as President
3. Tripuri Congress Session, 1939              :  Adoption of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Lahore Congress Session of 1929 is accurately linked to the declaration of Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the Congress's goal, marking a significant shift in the movement's objectives. The Haripura Congress Session of 1938 correctly saw Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President, highlighting a period of internal struggle within the Congress.  The Tripuri Congress Session, however, is incorrectly paired with the adoption of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; that pact was signed in 1931, following the first phase of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The Tripuri session was characterized by internal conflict between Gandhi and Bose leading to the latter's resignation. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                         Significant Contribution/Action
1.  C. Rajagopalachari                        :    Proposed the Rajagopalachari Formula
2.  Bhagat Singh                               :    Participated in the Kakori Conspiracy
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose                         :    Founded the Forward Bloc
4.  Mohan Singh                               :    Initially led the Indian National Army


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

C. Rajagopalachari is correctly associated with proposing the Rajagopalachari Formula, a significant attempt at resolving the constitutional deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League. Bhagat Singh's involvement in the Kakori Conspiracy is well-documented, making pair 2 correct. Subhas Chandra Bose's founding of the Forward Bloc is also historically accurate.  Mohan Singh's initial leadership of the Indian National Army (INA) before Subhas Chandra Bose's arrival is a well-established fact. All four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                                  Key Demand/Characteristic
1.  Civil Disobedience Movement, 1930-34       :   Salt Satyagraha
2.  Quit India Movement, 1942                   :   Parallel Governments
3.  Non-Cooperation Movement, 1920-22          :   Boycott of foreign goods
4.  Individual Satyagraha, 1940-41              :   Delhi Chalo Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Civil Disobedience Movement is correctly linked to the Salt Satyagraha, a pivotal campaign that symbolized defiance of British rule. The Quit India Movement witnessed the formation of several parallel governments in various regions as a form of resistance. The Non-Cooperation Movement involved a significant boycott of British goods and institutions. The Individual Satyagraha, though initially focused on individual acts of defiance, did lead to the Delhi Chalo Movement, a symbolic march towards the capital.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Acts, consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                             Key Provision
1. Government of India Act, 1919                :   Dyarchy introduced in provinces
2. Government of India Act, 1858                 :   Transfer of power from the East India Company to the Crown
3. Government of India Act, 1935                 :   Establishment of an All-India Federation (although it never materialized)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, is correctly paired with the introduction of dyarchy, a system of dual governance in provinces. The Government of India Act, 1858, accurately reflects the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown, a significant turning point in the history of British rule in India. The Government of India Act, 1935, aimed to establish an All-India Federation, though this aspect of the Act never came into effect due to the non-cooperation of the princely states.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Association/Activity
1.  Stafford Cripps                         :   Head of the Cripps Mission
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose                   :   Leader of the Azad Hind Fauj
3.  Rash Behari Bose                       :   Supreme Commander of INA (Indian National Army)
4.  Mohan Singh                           :   Formed the initial INA structure
5.  Lord Mountbatten                       :   Viceroy during the Shimla Conference


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Stafford Cripps led the Cripps Mission to India in 1942.  This is a well-established historical fact. Subhas Chandra Bose was undeniably the leader of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army or INA), a significant event in the Indian independence struggle.  Mohan Singh played a crucial role in the initial formation and organization of the INA before Subhas Chandra Bose took over.  The provided text states that Lord Mountbatten was the Viceroy when the Shimla Conference took place. Option (b) is incorrect because Rash Behari Bose was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the INA in Japan, but he did not serve as its Supreme Commander; that role belonged to Subhas Chandra Bose. Option (c) omits important correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy regarding Rash Behari Bose's role in the INA.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and their roles in the Indian independence movement.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                                 Prominent Figure

2.  Individual Satyagraha                       :   Vinoba Bhave
3.  Shimla Conference                           :   Lord Wavell
4.  Formation of Provisional Government of Azad Hind:   Subhas Chandra Bose
5.  The 1942 Movement                         :   Gandhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) All five
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aruna Asaf Ali played a significant role in the Quit India Movement, particularly after the arrest of other major Congress leaders.  The text clearly mentions Vinoba Bhave as the first Satyagrahi in the Individual Satyagraha movement. Lord Wavell convened the Shimla Conference. Subhas Chandra Bose established the Provisional Government of Azad Hind in Singapore.  Gandhi's leadership of the 1942 Quit India Movement is well-documented. All the pairs accurately reflect the association between the movement/event and the named personality.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs. The question tests factual recall of key personalities associated with important events in the Indian independence movement, requiring precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party/Group                        Ideological Stance/Goal
1.  Forward Bloc                              :   Complete Independence
2.  Congress Socialist Party                   :   Socialism within the Congress
3.  Communist Party of India                  :   Marxism-Leninism
4.  Hindu Mahasabha                           :   Hindu Nationalism
5.  Muslim League                             :   Pakistan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) Only 1 and 2
(d) Only 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Forward Bloc, led by Subhas Chandra Bose, advocated for complete independence from British rule. The Congress Socialist Party aimed to integrate socialist ideals within the Indian National Congress. The Communist Party of India adhered to Marxism-Leninism. The Hindu Mahasabha championed Hindu nationalism. The Muslim League's primary goal was the creation of Pakistan.  All five pairs correctly match the political entity with its core ideological stance or primary goal. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, excluding correctly matched pairs. This question assesses conceptual understanding of the various political ideologies prevalent during the Indian independence movement, requiring knowledge of their distinct goals and positions.


**4. With reference to the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                                 Key Demand/Objective
1.  Non-Cooperation Movement                    :   Swaraj
2.  Quit India Movement                          :   Immediate end of British Rule
3.  Cripps Mission                               :   Dominion Status
4.  Simla Conference                            :   Formation of an interim government
5.  Individual Satyagraha                       :   Anti-War Declaration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) All five
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement aimed for Swaraj (self-rule). The Quit India Movement demanded the immediate end of British rule in India. The Cripps Mission proposed Dominion Status as a pathway to independence. The Simla Conference focused on creating an interim government. Individual Satyagraha involved an anti-war declaration as a means of protest. Each pair accurately links the movement or event to its primary objective or central demand. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, leaving out correctly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect historical movements with their specific objectives, requiring a detailed understanding of the Indian independence movement's phases and goals.

   Person                                  Role/Position
1.  Lord Wavell                             :   Viceroy who proposed the Wavell Plan
2.  Stafford Cripps                          :   British negotiator who failed to secure Indian support for the war
3.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :   Leader who signed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                         :   First Prime Minister of India
5.  C. Rajagopalachari                       :   Proposed a formula for Congress-League cooperation

(b) All five
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lord Wavell's association with the Wavell Plan is a well-known historical fact. Stafford Cripps's failed mission to secure Indian support for the war effort is also well-documented. Mahatma Gandhi's pivotal role in the Gandhi-Irwin Pact is widely known. Jawaharlal Nehru's position as India's first Prime Minister is undisputed.  C. Rajagopalachari's proposal of a formula for Congress-League cooperation is a significant event. All five pairs accurately reflect the roles and positions held by these individuals during the critical period leading up to Indian independence. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of prominent figures and their actions in the final stages of the Indian independence movement.  The question demands precise knowledge of the individuals and their contributions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                      Prominent Figure/Leader
1. Government of India Act, 1935                 :   Lord Linlithgow
2.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                           :   Ramsay MacDonald
3.  Lahore Congress Session, 1929              :   Jawaharlal Nehru
4.  Third Round Table Conference                 :   B.R. Ambedkar
5.  Poona Pact                                   :   M.C. Rajah


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Linlithgow served as Viceroy of India during the passage and implementation of the Government of India Act, 1935, making pair 1 correct.  The Lahore Congress Session of 1929 is correctly linked to Jawaharlal Nehru's presidency and the declaration of Purna Swaraj, making pair 3 correct.  M.C. Rajah was a key figure in the negotiations leading to the Poona Pact, a crucial agreement resolving the conflict over separate electorates for depressed classes, hence pair 5 is also correct.

Pair 2 is incorrect because while Ramsay MacDonald was the British Prime Minister during the period of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, he wasn't directly involved in the negotiations. The pact was primarily between Gandhi and Lord Irwin. Pair 4 is also incorrect because, although B.R. Ambedkar participated in the Third Round Table Conference, it wasn't solely associated with him.  Many other significant leaders and representatives from various communities attended. The inclusion of these incorrect pairs serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical figures and their involvement in specific events.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between direct and indirect involvement in significant historical events.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session                         Key Decision/Event
1. Calcutta Session, 1928                    :   Adoption of Purna Swaraj
2. Lahore Session, 1929                      :   Resolution to launch Civil Disobedience Movement
3. Karachi Session, 1931                     :   Endorsement of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact
4. Patna Session, 1934                       :   Establishment of Parliamentary Board
5. Faizpur Session, 1936                      :   Decision to contest Provincial Elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect key decisions and events associated with specific Congress sessions. The Calcutta Session of 1928 witnessed the adoption of Purna Swaraj as the Congress goal.  The Lahore Session of 1929 authorized the launch of the Civil Disobedience Movement. The Karachi Session of 1931 formally endorsed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The Patna Session of 1934 established a Parliamentary Board to oversee Congress participation in elections. Finally, the Faizpur Session of 1936 decided that the Congress would contest the forthcoming provincial elections.  This question tests factual recall of significant events in the Indian National Congress' history, requiring precise knowledge of the chronological order and the decisions made at each session.  The inclusion of all correct pairs serves as a challenge, demanding thorough knowledge of the Congress's evolution and its strategic shifts.


**3. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Perspective/Leader                          Advocated Strategy
1. M.A. Ansari                               :   Continuous Direct Action
2. Jawaharlal Nehru                           :   Constitutional Struggle and Council Entry
3. Bhulabhai Desai                            :   Constructive Work on Gandhian Lines
4.  S. Satyamurthy                            :   Resumption of Non-Constitutional Mass Struggle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Bhulabhai Desai, along with others, indeed advocated for a focus on constructive work along Gandhian lines as an immediate strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The other pairs are incorrect.  M.A. Ansari and others advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections, not continuous direct action as stated in pair 1. Jawaharlal Nehru was a strong proponent of resuming non-constitutional mass struggle, directly opposing both constructive work and council entry (pair 2 and pair 4 are incorrect). S. Satyamurthy also supported constitutional struggle and council entry. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse perspectives within the Congress regarding its future strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement, requiring an understanding of the nuances of the debate and the positions of key leaders. The incorrect pairs serve as plausible distractors, testing the ability to distinguish between similar yet distinct viewpoints.



**4.  With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Act                              Description
1. All India Federation                          :   Successfully implemented immediately
2. Federal Level Executive                      :   Governor-General acting on advice of ministers for transferred subjects
3. Provincial Autonomy                          :   Replaced Dyarchy
4.  Concurrent List                              :   Subjects where both federal and provincial legislatures could legislate
5.  Communal Electorates                       :   Abolished under the Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1935, did indeed introduce provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system.  The Act also established a concurrent list, allowing both federal and provincial legislatures to legislate on certain subjects.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the proposed All-India Federation, a key feature of the Act, was never implemented due to the non-participation of many princely states. Pair 2 is partially correct, as the Governor-General did act on the advice of ministers for transferred subjects, but it's an incomplete description. The Governor-General retained significant reserved powers, not mentioned in the pair. Pair 5 is incorrect as the Act did not abolish communal electorates; instead, it further entrenched them, a fact deliberately included as a distractor. The question evaluates the candidate's understanding of the key provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and their implications. The incorrect options highlight the complexities and subtleties of the Act, assessing the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and partially accurate or misleading descriptions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure/Leader                      Stance on Office Acceptance (1937 Elections)
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                             :   Supported Office Acceptance
2. Subhas Chandra Bose                        :   Opposed Office Acceptance
3. Congress Socialists                           :   Supported Office Acceptance
4.  Gandhi (Initial Stance)                     :   Opposed Office Acceptance
5.  Proponents of Office Acceptance             :   Believed it was a matter of strategy, not socialism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the stances of various political figures and groups on the question of office acceptance in the 1937 provincial elections. Subhas Chandra Bose and the initial stance of Gandhi were firmly against office acceptance, while the proponents of office acceptance within the Congress viewed it as a strategic decision, not necessarily a compromise on socialist ideals.

Pair 1 is incorrect because Jawaharlal Nehru initially opposed office acceptance, although he later reconciled to the Congress's decision. Pair 3 is also incorrect; Congress Socialists, while having internal debates, largely opposed office acceptance, viewing it as potentially compromising the revolutionary character of the movement. The question tests the ability to recall and analyze the differing viewpoints within the Indian National Congress during a pivotal moment in its history, demanding a nuanced understanding of the political dynamics and ideological debates within the movement. The incorrect pairs are designed to be plausible distractors, making the question challenging and requiring careful consideration of the historical context.

Clement Attlee was the British Prime Minister who oversaw the transfer of power in 1947. Lord Mountbatten served as the last Viceroy and then the first Governor-General of independent India. Winston Churchill, a staunch opponent of Indian independence, famously resisted the process.  Subhas Chandra Bose famously escaped India and formed the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) with the support of the Axis powers during World War II.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurately matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete factual knowledge about the period.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of key figures and events surrounding India's independence.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall of prominent figures and their associations with specific movements and ideologies within the Indian National Movement.  The Quit India Movement was launched under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership, although Jawaharlal Nehru was a key figure in its execution. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc. The Nehru Report, outlining a constitutional framework for India, was drafted by Motilal Nehru. M.N. Roy played a crucial role in introducing communist ideas to India. Vinoba Bhave was one of the first participants in Gandhi's Individual Satyagraha. Option (a), (b), and (d) leave out one or more correctly matched pairs, showcasing incomplete knowledge of the key figures and their roles.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the diverse ideological currents within the movement.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Act/Policy              Key Feature/Consequence
1.  Government of India Act, 1935    :   Introduced Provincial Autonomy
2.  Communal Award                  :   Established separate electorates for various communities

4.  Montford Reforms                 :   Introduced Dyarchy in provinces
5.  Indian Councils Act of 1892       :   Expanded Legislative Councils with limited Indian representation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of various British government acts and policies related to India and their key features. The Government of India Act, 1935, a landmark legislation, introduced provincial autonomy. The Communal Award, announced by Ramsay MacDonald, established separate electorates for different religious communities. The Cripps Mission, while ultimately unsuccessful, proposed Dominion Status with the option for provinces to secede. The Montford Reforms introduced dyarchy (dual governance) in several provinces. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 expanded the legislative councils but maintained an official majority.  Options (a), (c), and (d) omit one or more accurately matched pairs, highlighting a lack of complete knowledge of the historical context.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the evolution of British policy towards India.


**4. With reference to the post-independence challenges faced by India, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                  Key Aspect/Consequence

3.  Communal Riots                         :   Radcliffe Line demarcation
4.  Communist Insurgency                  :   Telangana Movement
5.  Economic Development                 :   Five-Year Plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of the major challenges faced by newly independent India and their key characteristics. The integration of princely states involved military intervention, such as Operation Polo in Hyderabad. The refugee crisis following partition led to the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. The Radcliffe Line's hasty demarcation triggered widespread communal violence. The Telangana movement was a key aspect of the communist insurgency.  The Five-Year Plans represented a significant effort towards economic development. Options (a), (c), and (d) exclude one or more correctly matched pairs, indicating incomplete knowledge of the post-independence scenario. The question tests factual recall and an understanding of the complex challenges facing the new nation.  It also requires an understanding of the inter-relationship between different events.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Leader                   Ideological Stance/Position
1.  Mahatma Gandhi                   :   Advocated for complete independence and non-violent resistance.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                  :   Socialist and republican ideals.
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose               :   Supported complete independence, but advocated a more militant approach.
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel            :   Strong proponent of Hindu nationalism
5.  M.A. Ansari                         :   Moderates, supported council entry.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of the diverse ideological perspectives within the Indian National Congress. Mahatma Gandhi's leadership was characterized by a commitment to complete independence achieved through non-violent means. Jawaharlal Nehru embraced socialist and republican ideals. Subhas Chandra Bose, while also advocating complete independence, favored a more militant approach. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a strong proponent of Hindu nationalism. M.A. Ansari represented the moderate faction within the Congress and supported participation in legislative councils. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurately matched pairs. The question tests factual recall and an understanding of the ideological nuances within the freedom struggle.  It also assesses the ability to differentiate between the various approaches to achieving independence.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

     Person Deportated                     Year of Deportation
    1. Lala Lajpat Rai                       : 1908
    2. Ashwini Kumar Dutt                    : 1907
    3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                   : 1908
    4. Krishna Kumar Mitra                  : 1909

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and imprisoned for six years in 1908.  The deportation of nine Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, occurred in December 1908. Option (a) is incorrect as Lala Lajpat Rai was deported in 1907, not 1908. Option (c) is incorrect because Krishna Kumar Mitra's deportation was in 1908. Option (d) is incorrect because only Ashwini Kumar Dutt's deportation is correctly matched with the year 1908 in the given options.  The question highlights the government's repressive actions against prominent nationalist leaders during a period of heightened political unrest. Understanding the timing of these deportations is crucial for analyzing the context of the nationalist movement's evolution.  The precise years demonstrate the intensity of the government's response to rising dissent.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

     Nationalist Leader             Advocated
    1. Aurobindo Ghose              : Passive Resistance and Boycott of Government Services
    2. Jawaharlal Nehru             :  Self-sacrifice as essential for achieving national aims
    3. Bipin Chandra Pal            :  "To make the administration impossible" through organized refusal to cooperate

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghose was a prominent figure in the militant nationalist movement, advocating for passive resistance and boycotting government institutions. Jawaharlal Nehru, in his autobiography, reflects on the impact of the nationalist movement's call for self-sacrifice, inspiring young Indians. Bipin Chandra Pal's perspective on making the administration unworkable aligns with the strategies employed by militant nationalists during the Swadeshi and anti-partition movements.  All three statements accurately reflect the views and actions of these significant leaders.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the different facets of the nationalist movement, including the strategies and ideologies of its key figures.  The correct answer highlights the diversity of approaches within the movement, ranging from passive resistance to more radical methods.


**3.  With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following pairs:**

     Event                                    Outcome
    1. Surat Split (1907)                     :  Unified the Indian National Congress
    2. Morley-Minto Reforms (1909)           :  Increased elected representation in legislative councils
    3. Cancellation of Partition of Bengal (1911) :  Led to the creation of Bihar and Orissa as a separate province

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Surat Split of 1907 resulted in a division within the Indian National Congress, not unification. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 did indeed increase elected representation in legislative councils, albeit with limitations. The cancellation of the Partition of Bengal in 1911 did lead to the creation of Bihar and Orissa as a separate province. The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of key events and their consequences in the early nationalist movement.  The inclusion of an incorrect pairing (Surat Split) serves as a distractor, requiring careful analysis of the historical context.  The correct answer focuses on the limited success of constitutional reforms in addressing nationalist demands.


**4. With reference to the Nationalist Movement in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Political Ideology                          Prominent Proponent(s)
    1. Revolutionary Terrorism                  :  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki
    2. Constitutionalism                         :  Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale
    3. Socialism                                  :  M.N. Roy and Jawaharlal Nehru

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were involved in revolutionary terrorism during the early 20th century. Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale represented the constitutionalist approach within the nationalist movement. M.N. Roy and Jawaharlal Nehru were prominent figures in advocating socialist ideologies within the Congress.  All three pairs correctly match the political ideology with its proponents. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of diverse ideological strands within the Indian nationalist movement.  The accurate matching of all three pairs demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the movement's complexities. The question effectively assesses the candidate's ability to identify key figures associated with distinct political ideologies.


**5. With reference to the post-Civil Disobedience Movement period, consider the following pairs:**

     Position                                  Prominent Advocate(s)
    1.  Constructive Work on Gandhian Lines  :  M.A. Ansari and Asaf Ali
    2.  Council Entry                          :  Jawaharlal Nehru
    3.  Continuation of Non-Constitutional Mass Struggle :  Bhulabhai Desai and S. Satyamurthy

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

While M.A. Ansari and Asaf Ali advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections, they did not primarily champion constructive work on strictly Gandhian lines.  Jawaharlal Nehru was a strong proponent of continuing the non-constitutional mass struggle, not council entry.  Bhulabhai Desai and S. Satyamurthy were among those who favored constitutional struggle and council entry. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the various perspectives within the Congress regarding the post-CDM strategy.  The inclusion of plausible distractors tests their analytical skills and understanding of nuanced historical details. The correct answer highlights the significant role of Nehru in shaping the debate on future strategies.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the positions of these key figures.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

     Government of India Act Provision          Feature
    1.  All India Federation                       :   Came into effect in 1937
    2.  Provincial Autonomy                      :   Replaced Dyarchy
    3.  Separate Electorates                      :   Based on Communal Award

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 proposed an All-India Federation, but it never came into full effect due to the non-participation of Princely States. Provincial autonomy, a key feature of the Act, did replace dyarchy. The Act also incorporated separate electorates, based on the Communal Award.  The question evaluates the candidate’s understanding of the key provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.  The inclusion of the incorrect statement about the All India Federation serves as a key distractor, testing their ability to differentiate between proposed and implemented provisions. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the Act's impact on the Indian political landscape. The other options are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the implementation of the All-India Federation.


**7. With reference to the British policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Policy                                         Characteristic
    1. Divide and Rule                             :  Promoting Hindu-Muslim unity
    2.  Zamindars as Counterweights to Nationalists :   Supporting social reforms
    3.  Revenue Policies                             :  Maximizing income from land, regardless of cultivator welfare

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The British policy of "Divide and Rule" actively sought to create divisions within Indian society, not promote unity. Their strategy of using Zamindars often involved suppressing social reforms, not supporting them. British revenue policies prioritized maximizing revenue extraction, often at the expense of cultivator welfare.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of British policies and their impact.  The incorrect options highlight the manipulative nature of British policies, which often contradicted their stated aims. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the exploitative nature of British revenue systems.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the true nature of British policies.


**8. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

     Demand                                    Characteristic
    1.  Curtailment of Jury Powers                :  Supported by early nationalists
    2.  Development of Agricultural Banks        :  Advocated by Moderates
    3.  Spread of Primary Education              :  Opposed by early nationalists

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Early nationalists strongly opposed the curtailment of jury powers, seeing it as an infringement on civil liberties.  The Moderates advocated for the development of agricultural banks to alleviate peasant distress. The early nationalists, however, did not oppose the spread of primary education, but rather advocated for its expansion.  The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the demands and strategies of the early nationalist movement.  The inclusion of a partially incorrect statement about primary education serves as a distractor.  The correct answer demonstrates knowledge of the Moderates' focus on practical reforms. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the position of the early nationalists regarding the spread of primary education.



**9. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922), consider the following pairs:**

     Factor Contributing to the Movement         Nature
    1.  Economic Hardship after World War I        :  Strengthened anti-British sentiment
    2.  The Rowlatt Act                             :  Promoted Hindu-Muslim unity
    3.  Hunter Committee Report                    :  Satisfied Indian demands for self-government


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The post-World War I economic hardship in India did indeed fuel anti-British sentiment.  The Rowlatt Act, however, intensified discontent and sparked protests but did not directly promote Hindu-Muslim unity (although the movement did foster some unity). The Hunter Committee Report, far from satisfying Indian demands, was widely seen as a whitewash of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, further fueling resentment.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of the factors leading to the Non-Cooperation Movement. The inclusion of misleading statements about the Rowlatt Act and Hunter Committee Report tests their analytical skills. The correct answer emphasizes the role of economic factors in shaping the movement.  The other options are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the impact of the Rowlatt Act and the Hunter Committee Report.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Event                                      Significant Outcome
    1.  Chauri Chaura Incident                   :   Gandhi's withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement
    2.  Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress (1920):  Formal launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement
    3.  Treaty of Sevres (1920)                  :  Strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity in support of the Khilafat


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Chauri Chaura incident directly led to Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to the outbreak of violence. The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress in 1920 formally adopted the Non-Cooperation programme. The Treaty of Sevres, however, while contributing to the Khilafat agitation, did not directly lead to strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity in a way that was directly causal to the Non-Cooperation Movement. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Non-Cooperation Movement's key turning points.  The inclusion of a partially correct statement regarding the Treaty of Sevres tests their analytical skills and ability to differentiate between correlation and causation in historical events. The correct answer focuses on the direct causal links between events and their outcomes.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the impact of the Treaty of Sevres.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-Independence Event                       Key Figure
1.  Integration of Indian States                  :   Lord Mountbatten
2.  States Department                             :   Vallabhbhai Patel
3.  Kashmir's accession to India                 :   Sheikh Abdullah
4.  Formation of the States Department           :   Jawaharlal Nehru
5.  Privy Purse                                   :   C. Rajagopalachari


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in the integration of princely states into the Indian Union after independence, heading the States Department.  Sheikh Abdullah's leadership was instrumental in Kashmir's accession to India, though the process was complex and involved significant political maneuvering.  The privy purse, a system of allowances paid to former rulers of princely states, was a key element of the integration process, though its administration involved various figures.  Lord Mountbatten was the last Viceroy, but the integration of states primarily happened under Patel's leadership.  The formation of the States Department was directly under the purview of Vallabhbhai Patel and not Jawaharlal Nehru.  Option (d) correctly identifies the accurate pairings. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the incorrect pairing of the integration of states with Mountbatten. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of the States Department with Nehru, and while Sheikh Abdullah was vital to Kashmir's accession, it isn't strictly a direct pairing. Option (c) is also incorrect as it misses the correct pairing of Kashmir's accession with Sheikh Abdullah.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Resolution/Event                     Year
1.  Quit India Resolution                        :   1939
2.  Poona Pact                                  :   1932
3.  Government of India Act, 1935               :   1937
4.  Cabinet Mission Plan                         :   1946
5.  Lahore Congress Session (Purna Swaraj)     :   1929


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All are correctly matched


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Poona Pact, resolving the issue of separate electorates for the depressed classes, was signed in 1932. The Cabinet Mission Plan, proposing a constitutional framework for India, was presented in 1946. The Lahore Congress session, where the Congress adopted Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as its goal, took place in 1929.  The Quit India Resolution was passed in 1942, not 1939. The Government of India Act of 1935 was enacted in that year, and the elections under it happened in 1937, making the third pair incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect years associated with key events in the Indian National Movement, demonstrating the need for precise factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                        Ideology/Association
1.  Subhas Chandra Bose                       :   Forward Bloc
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                           :   Communism
3.  M.N. Roy                                     :   Indian Independence League
4.  Bhagat Singh                                :   Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
5.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                    :   No-Changers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) All are correctly matched


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose is correctly linked with the Forward Bloc, a political party he formed within the Congress. Bhagat Singh is correctly associated with the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a revolutionary organization. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is correctly identified with the No-Changers faction within the Congress, who opposed immediate participation in legislative councils.  While Jawaharlal Nehru held socialist views and was influenced by socialist and communist ideas, he was not directly associated with the Communist Party of India. M.N. Roy's primary association was with the Communist movement, not the Indian Independence League which was primarily associated with Subhas Chandra Bose and the INA.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are accurately matched.  The other options include incorrect associations, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of individuals and their affiliations within the complex Indian National Movement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                               Year
1.  The First World War                        :   1914-1918
2.  The Second World War                      :   1939-1945
3.  The Non-Cooperation Movement              :   1920-1922
4.  The Quit India Movement                    :   1942

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) All are correctly matched
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) All are correctly matched

**Explanation:**

All the pairs correctly match the major movements and events of the early to mid-20th century with their respective years. The First World War spanned 1914-1918; the Second World War occurred between 1939 and 1945. The Non-Cooperation Movement took place from 1920 to 1922, the Quit India Movement in 1942, and the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt in 1946. This question tests factual knowledge of key historical periods and events crucial for understanding the Indian freedom struggle.  All other options incorrectly omit one or more correctly matched pairs, thereby emphasizing the need for complete and accurate historical knowledge.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                       Significant Contribution/Association
1.  Mohan Singh                                 :   Indian National Army (INA)
2.  Rash Behari Bose                           :   Azad Hind Fauj
3.  Aruna Asaf Ali                              :   Quit India Movement
4.  C. Rajagopalachari                         :   Gandhi-Irwin Pact
5.  Lord Irwin                                  :   Communal Award


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All are correctly matched


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Mohan Singh played a significant role in the initial formation of the Indian National Army (INA), before Subhas Chandra Bose's involvement. Rash Behari Bose was instrumental in the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) formation and activities in Southeast Asia. Aruna Asaf Ali played a crucial role in the Quit India Movement, famously hoisting the Congress flag after the arrest of major leaders. C. Rajagopalachari was involved in negotiating the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The Communal Award was announced by Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, not Lord Irwin. This question tests knowledge of key figures and their roles in different phases and aspects of the Indian National Movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the association of Lord Irwin with the Communal Award,  highlighting the importance of avoiding generalisations and focusing on specific historical details.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                     Associated Movement/Organization
1.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :   All India Harijan Sevak Sangh
2.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                    :   Muslim League
3.  Acharya Narendra Dev                   :   Kashi Vidyapeeth
4.  Subhas Chandra Bose                    :   Forward Bloc
5.  Vallabhbhai Patel                       :   Bardoli Satyagraha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Mahatma Gandhi founded the All India Harijan Sevak Sangh in 1932 for the upliftment of the Dalits. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a prominent leader of the Muslim League, advocating for Muslim interests in India. Acharya Narendra Dev was a key figure in establishing the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a nationalist educational institution. Subhas Chandra Bose, after his differences with the Congress, formed the Forward Bloc. Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership in the Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement in Gujarat, is well-documented.  These figures and their associations are fundamental to understanding the Indian national movement's diverse leadership and the various movements and organizations that shaped its course. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of this period requires knowledge of all these figures and their roles.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of key figures and movements of the Indian freedom struggle.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Year
1.  Treaty of Sevres                             :  1922
2.  Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress :  1920
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident                       :  1922
4.  Formation of the All India Khilafat Committee:  1919
5.  Lucknow Pact                                :  1916

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, where the Non-Cooperation Movement was endorsed and significant organizational changes were made, took place in 1920. The Chauri Chaura incident, which led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, occurred in 1922. The All India Khilafat Committee was formed in early 1919. The Lucknow Pact, a significant milestone in Hindu-Muslim unity, was signed in 1916. Only the first pair is incorrectly matched; the Treaty of Sevres was signed in 1920, not 1922. This question assesses factual recall of important dates and events in the Indian freedom struggle.  The close proximity of some of the dates makes this question more challenging, testing the candidate's precise knowledge. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pair.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Key Figure                                  Role/Contribution
1.  Gandhi                                     :   President of the All India Khilafat Committee
2.  Shaukat Ali                               :   Leader of the Khilafat Committee
3.  C.R. Das                                  :   Opposed boycott of councils initially
4.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                       :   Initially opposed alliance with Muslim leaders on Khilafat
5.  Motilal Nehru                             :  Lawyer who gave up practice during the movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Gandhi's role as president of the All India Khilafat Committee is well established.  The Ali brothers, Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali, were key leaders of the Khilafat movement. C.R. Das initially expressed reservations about the boycott of councils, a key aspect of the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak initially opposed an alliance with Muslim leaders solely based on the religious Khilafat issue, preferring a broader nationalist approach. Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer, gave up his legal practice to participate actively in the movement. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the key players and their roles within the Non-Cooperation Movement, demonstrating an understanding of its complexities and internal debates. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of comprehensive knowledge for accurate matching.


**4. With reference to the events surrounding the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation/Event                      Impact/Consequence
1.  Rowlatt Act                            :   Increased Hindu-Muslim unity through shared opposition
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre             :   Strengthened anti-British sentiment
3.  Hunter Committee Report               :   Widely considered an eyewash
4.  Treaty of Sevres                        :   Led to widespread Muslim anger and disappointment
5.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms           :   Failed to satisfy Indian demands for self-government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Rowlatt Act, with its draconian provisions, led to widespread protests and fostered a sense of shared grievance among Hindus and Muslims. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre further intensified anti-British sentiment. The Hunter Committee's report on the Punjab atrocities was largely seen as a whitewash, failing to address the brutality of the events. The Treaty of Sevres, which severely curtailed the Ottoman Empire, deeply angered Indian Muslims. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing some limited self-governance, fell short of Indian aspirations. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the socio-political context of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, assessing their ability to link specific events to their consequences. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, demonstrating that a thorough understanding of the historical context is crucial for a correct response.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                           Political Stance/Association
1.  Annie Besant                             :   Initially supported the Swaraj Party
2.  G.S. Khaparde                            :   Left the Congress during the Non-Cooperation Movement
3.  B.C. Pal                                 :   Founded the Indian National Liberal Federation
4.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                     :   Initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement
5.  Surendranath Banerjea                   :   Supported the Swaraj Party


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Annie Besant, though later diverging, initially showed support for the Swaraj Party's approach. G.S. Khaparde, along with several other leaders, left the Congress during the Non-Cooperation Movement due to disagreements over strategy. B.C. Pal was among those who established the Indian National Liberal Federation. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, despite later differences, initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Surendranath Banerjea was among those who supported the Swaraj Party's efforts to work within the legislative councils.  This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the diverse political landscape of the period, understanding the shifts in alliances and the nuanced positions of various leaders.  The inclusion of several prominent figures and their shifting affiliations makes this a challenging question. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and, therefore, incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Prominent Figure
1. Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                 :    Lord Curzon
2.  Rowlatt Act                               :    Rabindranath Tagore
3.  Hunter Committee Report                  :    General Dyer
4.  Partition of Bengal                       :    Lord Minto

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919) was ordered by General Dyer, not Lord Curzon.  Lord Curzon was Viceroy of India during a different period and is associated with the Partition of Bengal (1905), but the event's execution was under his successor.  The Rowlatt Act (1919) led to widespread protests and civil disobedience, which included Rabindranath Tagore renouncing his knighthood in protest against the British government's actions in Punjab,  but the Act itself is not directly linked to Tagore's action. The Hunter Committee was established to investigate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the events that led to it; therefore, its report is associated with General Dyer and the aftermath of the massacre. The Partition of Bengal, while not directly overseen by Lord Minto, occurred during his tenure as Viceroy and was a significant event of his administration. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other pairs link figures to events they were not directly involved in, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in understanding historical events.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Act                            Key Feature/Outcome
1.  Khilafat Movement                       :   Abolition of the Caliphate in 1924
2.  Non-Cooperation Movement              :   Chauri Chaura incident
3.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms          :   Introduction of Dyarchy
4.  Rowlatt Act                             :   Increased restrictions on civil liberties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Khilafat Movement, though initially focused on protecting the Ottoman Caliphate, ultimately ended with the Caliphate's abolition in 1924 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. This event significantly impacted the movement's trajectory and its relevance in India. The Non-Cooperation Movement is directly linked to the Chauri Chaura incident, a violent clash that led Gandhi to suspend the movement. The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms introduced the system of Dyarchy, a dual system of governance with both elected and nominated officials. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, significantly curtailed civil liberties and intensified nationalist resentment. All the pairs correctly link the movements/acts to their key features or significant outcomes.  The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to identify the accurate connections between historical events and their consequences, demanding precise knowledge.


**3.  With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                  Significant Association
1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                    :   Nehru Report
2.  Bhagat Singh                            :   Kakori Conspiracy Case
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose                  :   Forward Bloc
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                :   Bardoli Satyagraha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while a prominent figure in Indian politics, was not directly associated with the Nehru Report, which was drafted by Motilal Nehru. Bhagat Singh was a key figure in the Hindustan Republican Association and was involved in the Kakori Conspiracy Case. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc, a breakaway faction of the Indian National Congress. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel led the Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement in Gujarat. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The inclusion of Jinnah and the Nehru Report serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of key figures and events. The question necessitates a thorough understanding of the Indian independence movement and its prominent personalities.


**4. With reference to the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                   Location
1.  Partition of Bengal                     :   Delhi
2.  Congress Session (1920)               :   Nagpur
3.  Chauri Chaura Incident                 :   Gorakhpur
4.  Formation of the Hindustan Republican Association :  Allahabad

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Partition of Bengal in 1905 primarily affected Bengal, not Delhi.  The Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, where the Non-Cooperation Movement was formally endorsed, took place in Nagpur. The Chauri Chaura incident, a violent clash that led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, occurred in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.  The Hindustan Republican Association, a revolutionary organization, was founded in Allahabad.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairing of the Partition of Bengal with Delhi serves as a significant distractor, testing precise knowledge of locations associated with key events.  The question assesses the candidate's recall of specific geographic locations associated with critical moments in Indian history.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                        Political Ideology/Association
1.  M.N. Roy                               :   Ghadar Party
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                        :   Socialism
3.  Gandhi                                  :   Non-violent Non-cooperation
4.  Mohammad Ali Jinnah                    :   Pakistan Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

M.N. Roy was a prominent Marxist and communist figure, but he was not directly associated with the Ghadar Party.  Jawaharlal Nehru was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and a strong advocate of Socialism. Gandhi's philosophy and political strategy were rooted in Non-violent Non-cooperation. Mohammad Ali Jinnah led the Pakistan Movement, advocating for the creation of a separate Muslim state.  Therefore, three out of the four pairs (2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.  The inclusion of M.N. Roy and the Ghadar party serves as a plausible but incorrect pairing, testing the examinee's knowledge of the nuances within the broader Indian nationalist movement.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between different political ideologies and their prominent proponents within the context of the Indian Independence Movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation related to the Non-Cooperation Movement, Khilafat Movement, Quit India Movement, and related political developments in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                     Key Figure/Organization
1.  Khilafat Committee                :   Mahatma Gandhi
2.  Non-Cooperation Movement       :   Shaukat Ali
3.  Awadh Kisan Movement            :   Baba Ramchandra
4.  Jamia Millia Islamia               :   Zakir Husain
5.  Indian Independence League      :  Rash Behari Bose


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately matches the key figures and organizations to their respective movements/events.  Shaukat Ali was a prominent leader of the Khilafat movement and played a crucial role in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Zakir Husain was associated with the founding and development of Jamia Millia Islamia. Rash Behari Bose was instrumental in establishing the Indian Independence League.

Option (a) is incorrect because while Mahatma Gandhi was involved in the Khilafat Movement, he wasn't the leader of the Khilafat Committee. The Ali brothers and Maulana Azad held key leadership positions.  Option (b) is partially correct, but incorrectly includes the Khilafat committee pairing. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccurate pairing of the Khilafat Committee and Mahatma Gandhi. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent figures and their roles in various movements, requiring recall of specific details and the ability to differentiate between roles and associations.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of the Movement              Characteristic
1.  Economic Boycott                   :   Supported by all sections of Indian business
2.  Educational Institutions           :   Primarily urban, middle-class participation
3.  Peasant Participation              :   Led to confrontations between lower and upper castes
4.  Hindu-Muslim Unity                :   Completely unblemished throughout the movement
5.  Government Response               :   Immediate and decisive crackdown on all protestors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only the statement regarding peasant participation accurately reflects the reality of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The peasant participation, while substantial, did indeed lead to conflicts between various caste groups, notably in Bihar, where existing social tensions were intertwined with the movement's dynamics.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the economic boycott received support from many Indian businesses, it was not universally supported by all sections. Larger businesses were often hesitant due to fears of labor unrest. Option (c) is partially correct concerning peasant participation but is wrong about the government's response. The government's response was not immediate and decisive against all protestors initially, opting for a more cautious approach in the early stages of the movement. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate statements about economic boycott, educational institutions, Hindu-Muslim unity, and the government's response.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to analyze the multifaceted nature of the movement and identify the nuances of its various aspects, going beyond simple factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                      Outcome/Consequence
1.  Treaty of Sevres (1920)          :   Strengthened the Khilafat Movement
2.  Chauri Chaura Incident (1922)    :   Led to the immediate arrest of Gandhi
3.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact (1931)          :   Suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement
4.  Communal Award (1932)           :   Accepted without reservation by the Congress
5.  Poona Pact (1932)                 :   Established separate electorates for depressed classes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the Gandhi-Irwin Pact directly resulted in the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement. This was a key outcome of the negotiations between Gandhi and Lord Irwin, representing a temporary truce in the struggle for independence.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the Treaty of Sevres did initially anger Indian Muslims and intensified the Khilafat issue, it didn't directly strengthen the movement in a straightforward manner; the movement's strength was more complex.  The Chauri Chaura incident did not lead to Gandhi's immediate arrest, although it did hasten the government's crackdown. Option (c) is incorrect as the Congress did not accept the Communal Award without reservation. They strongly opposed the principle of separate electorates. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes several mismatched pairs, demonstrating the candidate's ability to evaluate the interconnectedness of historical events and their consequences.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader/Organization                Role/Activity
1.  Aruna Asaf Ali                   :   Underground radio broadcasts in Bombay
2.  Usha Mehta                       :   Presided over the AICC session after arrests
3.  Chittu Pandey                     :   Led parallel government in Ballia
4.  J.M. Sengupta                    :   Prominent leader in Assam's tea plantation strikes
5.  Ram Manohar Lohia                :   Participated in the Imphal campaign


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the roles played by Aruna Asaf Ali (underground radio), Chittu Pandey (parallel government in Ballia), and J.M. Sengupta (Assam tea plantation strikes) during the Quit India Movement.  These figures represent different facets of the movement's activities—from underground operations to regional resistance efforts.

Option (a) is incorrect because Usha Mehta's role was to operate an underground radio station, not preside over the AICC session.  Aruna Asaf Ali presided over that session. Option (c) is incorrect as Ram Manohar Lohia was involved in underground activities but not in the Imphal campaign.  That campaign was primarily associated with the INA. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatched roles of Usha Mehta and Ram Manohar Lohia. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the diverse leadership and activities within the Quit India Movement, demanding detailed recall of individuals and their contributions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                    Stance on Office Acceptance (1937 Elections)
1.  Jawaharlal Nehru                  :   Opposed office acceptance
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose              :   Favored office acceptance to further revolutionary goals
3.  Gandhi                             :   Initially opposed, later gave conditional approval
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel          :   Strongly opposed office acceptance
5.  C. Rajagopalachari                :   Supported office acceptance unconditionally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the stances of Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi regarding the acceptance of office in the 1937 provincial elections.  Nehru, along with other leftists, was initially opposed to office acceptance, viewing it as a compromise with the colonial system. Gandhi, while initially hesitant, eventually gave conditional approval, emphasizing that office acceptance should not lead to a compromise on the ultimate goal of independence.

Option (a) is incorrect because Subhas Chandra Bose did not favor office acceptance unconditionally; his view was more nuanced, aimed at using office to further revolutionary goals. Option (b) is partially correct regarding Nehru and Gandhi but is wrong about Sardar Patel, who also initially opposed office acceptance. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccurate portrayal of Subhas Bose's and C. Rajagopalachari's positions. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the complex political debates within the Congress and the diverse viewpoints on strategic approaches to the freedom struggle.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual          Role/Association
1.  Stafford Cripps      :  Leader of the House of Commons
2.  Winston Churchill   :  Secretary of State for India
3.  Lord Linlithgow     :  Viceroy of India during World War II
4.  Lord Mountbatten    :  Governor-General of India after Independence
5.  Wedgewood Benn    : Secretary of State for India in 1929


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Stafford Cripps was indeed the Leader of the House of Commons and a member of the British War Cabinet who led the Cripps Mission to India in 1942. Lord Linlithgow served as the Viceroy of India during a significant portion of World War II. Lord Mountbatten held the position of Governor-General of India following Independence.  Option (d) is incorrect because Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of Britain, not the Secretary of State for India. While Wedgewood Benn was Secretary of State for India, this was in 1929, not during the period covered by the other individuals listed in the pairs, making his inclusion as a distractor.  Options (b) and (c) incorrectly include elements from the incorrect pairs. The question tests factual recall of individuals and their roles within a specific historical context, requiring accurate knowledge to identify the correct matches.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings makes this question difficult.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session     President
1.  Haripura Session    :  Jawaharlal Nehru
2.  Tripuri Session     :  Subhas Chandra Bose
3.  Lahore Session      :  Motilal Nehru
4.  Ramgarh Session    :  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Tripuri session of the Indian National Congress in 1939 was indeed presided over by Subhas Chandra Bose.  The Ramgarh session of the Congress in 1940 was presided over by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Option (b) is incorrect because the Haripura session was presided over by Subhas Chandra Bose, not Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Lahore session was presided by Jawaharlal Nehru, not Motilal Nehru. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is only partially correct. This question tests factual recall of historical events, specifically Congress sessions and their respective presidents, requiring precise knowledge to identify the accurate pairings. The strategically placed incorrect options demand careful consideration of each pair, enhancing the difficulty level.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure       Ideology/Association
1.  Bhagat Singh          :  Hindustan Republican Association
2.  Jayaprakash Narayan :  Congress Socialist Party
3.  M.N. Roy             :  Communist Party of India
4.  Acharya Narendra Dev:  Forward Bloc
5.  C. Rajagopalachari   :  Swatantra Party


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Bhagat Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (later Hindustan Socialist Republican Association). Jayaprakash Narayan was a key leader of the Congress Socialist Party. M.N. Roy played a crucial role in the formation of the Communist Party of India. C. Rajagopalachari was a founder-member of the Swatantra Party. Option (d) is incorrect because Acharya Narendra Dev was associated with the Congress Socialist Party, not the Forward Bloc. The question tests the ability to link political figures with their respective ideologies and political affiliations, demanding detailed knowledge of the Indian political landscape of the early to mid-20th century. The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect option (Acharya Narendra Dev) increases the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge to arrive at the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Indian Independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                                      Key Figure
1.  Government of India Act, 1935             :  Lord Irwin
2.  Poona Pact                                   :  B.R. Ambedkar
3.  August Offer                                 :  Lord Linlithgow
4.  Cripps Mission                              :  Stafford Cripps
5.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                           :  Jawaharlal Nehru


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

B.R. Ambedkar played a pivotal role in the negotiation and signing of the Poona Pact.  Lord Linlithgow announced the August Offer. Stafford Cripps headed the Cripps Mission to India. Option (b) is incorrect because the Government of India Act, 1935, was enacted during Lord Linlithgow's viceroyalty, not Lord Irwin's.  Option (c) and (d) also incorrectly include the pairing of Gandhi-Irwin pact with Jawaharlal Nehru.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin. The question tests the association of key events and figures in the Indian independence movement, demanding precise knowledge of the historical context and the roles played by various individuals. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings increases the question's difficulty, requiring a nuanced understanding of the historical timeline and individual contributions.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Movement                  Prominent Leader
1.  Khudai Khidmatgars                  :  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan
2.  Forward Bloc                          :  Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) :  Lala Lajpat Rai
4.  Congress Socialist Party              :  Subhas Chandra Bose
5.  Justice Party                           :  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Khudai Khidmatgars, a non-violent Pashtun movement, were led by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Lala Lajpat Rai was a prominent leader of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC). Option (c) is partially correct, but it incorrectly includes the Congress Socialist Party. While Subhas Chandra Bose was associated with the left-wing of the Congress, he did not lead the Congress Socialist Party (Acharya Narendra Dev and Jayaprakash Narayan were prominent leaders). The Justice Party was not led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker; he led the Self-Respect Movement. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairings of Forward Bloc with Jawaharlal Nehru and Justice Party with E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker.  The question tests the ability to match organizations and movements with their key leaders during a specific historical period, requiring detailed knowledge of the individuals and their contributions.  The inclusion of plausible distractors increases the difficulty, ensuring that only those with a strong grasp of the subject can answer correctly.


**6. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Resolution/Pact        Location/Year
1.  Pakistan Resolution    :  Lahore, 1940
2.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact      :  Delhi, 1931
3.  Nehru Report           :  Calcutta, 1928
4.  Communal Award       :  London, 1932
5.  Poona Pact             :  Poona, 1932


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Pakistan Resolution was passed in Lahore in 1940. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in Delhi in 1931. The Nehru Report was drafted and approved in Calcutta in 1928.  The Communal Award was announced in London in 1932. The Poona Pact was signed in Poona in 1932.  All the pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall of significant events and their locations and years in the Indian National Movement.  The straightforward nature of the correct answer, however, serves as a distractor, potentially leading candidates to overlook errors in other options, making it a difficult question despite its seemingly simple presentation.  The inclusion of all correct pairs, in contrast to other questions with only a subset being correct, enhances the difficulty and requires thorough knowledge of the historical timeline and events.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Position Held
1. Subhas Chandra Bose        : President, Indian National Congress
2. Pattabhi Sitaramayya       : President, Indian National Congress
3. Rajendra Prasad             : President, Indian National Congress
4. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad   : President, Indian National Congress
5. Jawaharlal Nehru           : President, Indian National Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five individuals listed served as Presidents of the Indian National Congress at different points in its history.  Subhas Chandra Bose's presidency was marked by internal conflict within the Congress.  Pattabhi Sitaramayya's election was seen as a victory for Gandhi's faction after Bose's resignation. Rajendra Prasad succeeded Bose after his resignation in 1939. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad also served as Congress President, and Jawaharlal Nehru held the position multiple times.  Therefore, all the pairings are accurate reflections of historical fact.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and their roles within the Indian National Congress, a crucial aspect of understanding the movement's evolution and internal dynamics.  Understanding the sequence of presidencies and the context surrounding each leader's term is vital for analyzing the Congress's trajectory during the freedom struggle.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session          Location
1. Lahore Session             : Calcutta
2. Tripuri Session             : Jabalpur
3. Haripura Session           : Gujarat
4. Ramgarh Session            : Madhya Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Haripura session of the Indian National Congress was indeed held in Gujarat. The Tripuri session was held near Jabalpur in the then Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh).  Option 1 is incorrect because the Lahore session was not held in Calcutta; it was held in Lahore. Option 4 is incorrect because the Ramgarh session was not held in Madhya Pradesh; it was held in Ramgarh.  The question assesses factual recall of significant Congress sessions and their locations. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the geographical spread of the nationalist movement and the context surrounding various decisions and events at these sessions. The subtle inaccuracies in the distractor options test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related yet incorrect information, demanding precise knowledge of historical details.


**3. With reference to the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement                    Key Figure
1.  Akali Movement             :  Mahatma Gandhi
2.  Bardoli Satyagraha          :  Vallabhbhai Patel
3.  Champaran Satyagraha      :  Jawaharlal Nehru
4.  Moplah Rebellion           :  Subhas Chandra Bose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement in Gujarat, was indeed led by Vallabhbhai Patel.  Options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Akali Movement was a Sikh movement primarily focused on temple reforms and was not led by Mahatma Gandhi.  The Champaran Satyagraha was led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru.  The Moplah Rebellion was a peasant uprising in Malabar, Kerala, with primarily Muslim participation, and Subhas Chandra Bose was not a key figure in that movement.  The question tests the ability to associate key figures with specific movements within the Indian nationalist movement. It requires a detailed understanding of the diverse nature of the movement and the different regional and community-specific struggles that contributed to the overall fight for independence. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge.


**4.  With reference to the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Person                  Association
1.  M.N. Roy                 : Hindustan Republican Association
2.  Bhagat Singh              : Forward Bloc
3.  Surya Sen                 : Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
4.  Chandrashekhar Azad      :  Chittagong Armoury Raid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Surya Sen was indeed the key leader of the Chittagong Armoury Raid.  Chandrashekhar Azad was a prominent leader of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a successor organization to the Hindustan Republican Association. Option 1 is incorrect; M.N. Roy was not associated with the Hindustan Republican Association. Option 2 is incorrect; Bhagat Singh was associated with the HSRA, not the Forward Bloc, which was formed by Subhas Chandra Bose. The question tests knowledge of key figures in revolutionary movements and their affiliations.  It requires understanding the organizational structures and ideological shifts within the revolutionary movement, demonstrating a deeper understanding beyond surface-level knowledge.  The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge the candidate's knowledge of the intricacies of these organizations and their relationships.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                  Description
1.  Government of India Act, 1935: Introduced Dominion Status for India
2.  August Offer, 1940         :  Proposed a constituent assembly after the war
3.  Cripps Mission, 1942       :  Offered complete independence immediately
4.  Nehru Report, 1928         :  Recommended Dominion Status as the next step

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The August Offer of 1940 did indeed propose the formation of a constituent assembly after the war. The Nehru Report of 1928 recommended Dominion Status as the next step for India.  Options 1 and 3 are incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did not introduce Dominion Status immediately; it laid the groundwork for a federation but fell short of granting Dominion Status. The Cripps Mission did not offer complete independence immediately; it proposed dominion status after the war.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of key constitutional proposals and events during the independence movement.  It requires the ability to differentiate between the nuances of different proposals, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the historical context and the various stages of constitutional development.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge and ability to analyze the subtleties of constitutional proposals.


**6. With reference to the early Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

    Demand                     Leader prominently associated
1.  Indianisation of higher administrative services :  Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  Swaraj within the British Empire             :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale
3.  Abolition of the Salt Tax                      :  Bal Gangadhar Tilak
4.  Expansion and reform of Legislative Councils  :  Surendranath Banerjea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Surendranath Banerjea were all prominent leaders of the early Indian National Congress and actively championed the demands mentioned. Dadabhai Naoroji strongly advocated for the Indianization of higher administrative services to address economic drain and promote Indian participation in governance. Gopal Krishna Gokhale is closely associated with the demand for Swaraj within the British Empire, advocating for self-government within the framework of the British Empire, similar to the dominion status enjoyed by Canada and Australia. Surendranath Banerjea actively campaigned for the expansion and reform of legislative councils, demanding greater Indian representation and increased powers for these bodies.  Option 3 is incorrect. While the abolition of the salt tax was a significant demand later in the movement, it wasn't a primary focus during the early moderate phase, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak is more strongly associated with later, more radical phases of the movement.  The question assesses knowledge of the key demands and associated leaders during the early, moderate phase of the Indian National Congress.  It requires a nuanced understanding of the evolution of demands and the roles played by different leaders in shaping the movement's agenda.  The distractor options test the candidate's ability to differentiate between demands and leaders associated with different phases of the movement.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Policy            Prominent Proponent
1.  Satyagraha                  :  Subhas Chandra Bose
2.  Trusteeship                 :  Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  Purna Swaraj                :  Mahatma Gandhi
4.  Hind Swaraj                 :  M.K. Gandhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi is the prominent proponent of both Purna Swaraj (complete independence) and the philosophy expounded in Hind Swaraj.  Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent nationalist leader, Satyagraha is primarily associated with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy. Similarly, the concept of Trusteeship, advocating for responsible capitalism, is strongly linked to Gandhi's economic thought, not Jawaharlal Nehru's. The question assesses understanding of core concepts and their association with specific leaders within the Indian National Congress.  It demands a clear understanding of the ideological differences and contributions of key figures in shaping the movement's philosophy and goals. The distractors test the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related concepts and their correct proponents.


**8. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Action                   Outcome
1.  Chauri Chaura incident       : Suspension of the movement
2.  Arrest of Ali Brothers        :  Increased participation of Muslims
3.  Arrival of Prince of Wales   : Mass demonstrations and protests
4.  Gandhi's arrest, 1922       :  Disintegration within nationalist ranks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the deaths of policemen, directly led to Mahatma Gandhi suspending the Non-Cooperation Movement. The arrest of the Ali brothers, prominent Muslim leaders, initially increased Muslim participation in the movement due to the shared cause of the Khilafat issue. The arrival of the Prince of Wales in India sparked widespread demonstrations and protests as part of the Non-Cooperation Movement. Option 4 is incorrect. While Gandhi's arrest in 1922 did contribute to some disarray, the primary impact was the weakening of organized resistance, not a complete disintegration of nationalist ranks. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key events and their consequences within the Non-Cooperation Movement. It demands an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships and the movement's evolution, including the reasons for its success and eventual suspension. The distractor options test the candidate's ability to analyze the significance of various events and their impact on the overall trajectory of the movement.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Post-Non-Cooperation Movement Faction    Leader
1.  Swarajists                                   :  C. Rajagopalachari
2.  No-Changers                                 :  Motilal Nehru
3.  Responsivists (within Swarajists)           :  Lala Lajpat Rai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai was indeed a prominent Responsivist within the Swarajist faction.  Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. While C. Rajagopalachari was a prominent leader during this period, he is more closely associated with the No-Changers, who opposed entry into legislative councils.  Motilal Nehru, while a key Swarajist leader initially, was also involved in the shift toward a more conciliatory approach within the Swarajist party, making the pairing inaccurate.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the factions that emerged within the Indian National Congress after the Non-Cooperation Movement and their respective leadership. It requires detailed knowledge of the internal dynamics of the Congress and the differing approaches to the struggle for independence. The distractor options test the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related yet distinct political factions and their leaders.


**10. With reference to the socialist and communist influences on the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Event                Key Figure
1.  Communist Party of India (CPI)     :  M.N. Roy
2.  Meerut Conspiracy Case             :  Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) :  Lala Lajpat Rai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

M.N. Roy played a crucial role in the formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI).  Lala Lajpat Rai was a prominent figure in the early years of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC). Option 2 is incorrect. While Jawaharlal Nehru was a key figure in the Indian National Movement and held socialist views, he was not directly involved in the Meerut Conspiracy Case, which primarily involved communist and trade union leaders. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key figures associated with the rise of socialist and communist organizations and events within the Indian National Movement. It demands knowledge of the organizational structures and the individuals who shaped the left-wing currents within the broader national struggle. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the historical context.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                  Leader
1.  Lahore Congress Session (1929)      :   Motilal Nehru
2.  Nagpur Congress Session (1920)      :   Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  Karachi Congress Session (1931)     :   Mahatma Gandhi
4.  Calcutta Congress Session (1928)    :   M.A. Ansari


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 only.  The Karachi Congress Session of 1931 was presided over by Mahatma Gandhi. This session is significant for endorsing the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and passing resolutions on fundamental rights and the national economic program.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Lahore Congress Session of 1929 was presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru, not Motilal Nehru.  This session is notable for declaring Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the Congress's goal and launching the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Option 2 is incorrect.  The Nagpur session of 1920 was presided over by Mahatma Gandhi.  This session is crucial for formally adopting the Non-Cooperation Movement and making significant organizational changes within the Congress.

Option 4 is also incorrect. The Calcutta session of 1928 was presided over by Motilal Nehru, not M.A. Ansari. This session saw the acceptance of the Nehru Report, although younger Congress members expressed dissatisfaction with its proposal of dominion status.  M.A. Ansari presided over the Madras Congress session of 1927.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following pairs:**

   Institution Founded                         Year of Founding
1.  Gujarat Vidyapeeth                       :   1920
2.  Jamia Millia Islamia                     :   1925
3.  Kashi Vidyapeeth                         :   1921
4.  Bihar Vidyapeeth                        :   1921


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 1, 3, and 4 only.  Gujarat Vidyapeeth, Kashi Vidyapeeth, and Bihar Vidyapeeth were all founded during the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22).  These institutions represent the nationalist effort to establish alternative educational systems independent of British control.

Option 2 is incorrect. While Jamia Millia Islamia is a significant nationalist educational institution, its founding year was 1920, not 1925. The institution's origins can be traced to the Non-Cooperation Movement, but its formal establishment occurred earlier than stated. The exact date of its founding is debated, but not 1925.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Role/Association
1.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha                      :   Turkish Sultan during the Khilafat Movement
2.  Hakim Ajmal Khan                        :   Leader of the Khilafat Movement
3.  C.R. Das                                  :   President of the Ahmedabad Congress Session (1921)
4.  J.M. Sengupta                           :   Prominent leader in Assam during Non-Cooperation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 2 and 4 only. Hakim Ajmal Khan was a prominent leader of the Khilafat Movement, playing a crucial role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement. J.M. Sengupta was a key figure in the labor movements and strikes organized in Assam during the Non-Cooperation Movement.


Option 1 is incorrect. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was not the Turkish Sultan during the Khilafat Movement; he was the leader who abolished the Caliphate and established a secular Turkish republic.  The Khilafat Movement concerned the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I.

Option 3 is incorrect.  While C.R. Das was a significant Swarajist leader, he presided over the Ahmedabad Congress session in 1921 while imprisoned; Hakim Ajmal Khan acted as the president.


**4. With reference to the Simon Commission, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about the Simon Commission        True/False
1.  It was appointed to enquire into the working of the 1919 Act  :   True
2.  It recommended a Federal Form of Government            :   True
3.  It was headed by Sir John Simon                        :   True
4.  It was unanimously supported by Indian leaders             :   False


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 1, 2, and 3 only. The Simon Commission was indeed appointed to review the working of the Government of India Act of 1919. Its report recommended a federal form of government for India. Sir John Simon was the chairman of the commission.  The key point is that the commission was boycotted by major Indian political leaders and was not supported unanimously.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                  Key Feature/Outcome
1.  Government of India Act, 1935           :   Established Provincial Autonomy
2.  Poona Pact (1932)                          :   Introduced Separate Electorates for Depressed Classes
3.  Communal Award (1932)                    :   Increased Reserved Seats for Depressed Classes
4.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact (1931)                  :   Suspension of Civil Disobedience Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) 1, 3, and 4 only. The Government of India Act, 1935, a landmark legislation, introduced provincial autonomy, a significant step towards self-governance. The Communal Award, though controversial, led to the reservation of seats for various minority communities, including the depressed classes. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement to allow for negotiations.

Option 2 is incorrect. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, actually *abolished* separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with increased reserved seats within joint electorates.  The Communal Award initially proposed separate electorates for the depressed classes, which the Poona Pact then altered.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on various aspects of the Swarajist movement, socialist ideas, revolutionary activities, and other political forces in India during the 1920s and 1930s.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure           Associated Political Group/Party
1.  C.R. Das                    :   No-Changers
2.  Motilal Nehru              :   Swarajist Party
3.  Vallabhbhai Patel           :   Congress Socialist Party
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru           :   Swarajist Party
5.  Subhas Chandra Bose       :   Forward Bloc

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were key figures in the Swarajist Party, which advocated for participation in legislative councils. Vallabhbhai Patel was a prominent No-Changer, opposing council entry. Jawaharlal Nehru was not directly associated with the Swarajist Party, although he had his own distinct political views. Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Forward Bloc as a more radical faction within the Congress. Option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings of individuals with their associated political affiliations. Options (a), (b), and (c) contain incorrect pairings based on historical inaccuracies.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the different political factions within the Indian National Congress during this period.


**2. With reference to the Indian political landscape of the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Movement          Prominent Leader
1.  Hindustan Republican Association :   Bhagat Singh
2.  Communist Party of India          :   M.N. Roy
3.  Self-Respect Movement             :   Motilal Nehru
4.  Akali Movement                    :   Vallabhbhai Patel
5.  Justice Party                       :   E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Hindustan Republican Association (later Hindustan Socialist Republican Association) was indeed associated with Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries. M.N. Roy played a significant role in the founding of the Communist Party of India. The Self-Respect Movement was led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar"). The Akali Movement was primarily a Sikh movement for religious reform in the Punjab, not directly led by Vallabhbhai Patel.  The Justice Party was a Dravidian movement in Madras Presidency, so this pairing is correct. Option (c) correctly identifies the leaders associated with these movements. The other options include inaccurate pairings, demonstrating a need for precise knowledge of the individuals and their roles in different political and social movements. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various movements and their leaders.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Legislation                        Year
1.  Kakori Conspiracy Case                 :   1928
2.  Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case      :   1925
3.  Formation of the Hindustan Republican Association: 1920
4.  Chittagong Armoury Raid                :   1930
5.  Meerut Conspiracy Case                 :   1929

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case occurred in 1924, not 1925. The Hindustan Republican Association was formed in 1924, not 1920. The other events are correctly matched with their years.  The question tests factual recall of significant events in the Indian freedom struggle and their chronological order. The inclusion of slightly incorrect dates as distractors makes this a difficult question. Option (b) is correct because it accurately reflects the years of these events. The other options include at least one incorrect pairing, showcasing the need for precise historical knowledge.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of historical timelines.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session                       Location
1.  Gaya Session                         :   1922
2.  Nagpur Session                       :   1920
3.  Lahore Session                        :   1929
4.  Haripura Session                     :   1938
5.  Tripuri Session                      :   1939

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress, where the declaration of Purna Swaraj was made, took place in 1929, not 1928. All other pairings are correct. The question assesses knowledge of important Congress sessions, their locations, and the historical context.  The inclusion of a slightly incorrect year as a distractor increases the difficulty level. Option (b) correctly matches the Congress sessions with their respective locations. The other options contain at least one incorrect pairing, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical events. This question tests factual recall and knowledge of the Indian National Congress's activities during a specific period.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                  Significant Contribution/Association
1.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha             :   Abolition of the Caliphate
2.  Lord Linlithgow                  :   August Offer of 1940
3.  Stafford Cripps                  :   Government of India Act 1935
4.  John P. Saunders                 :   Death in anti-Simon Commission protest
5.  James Scott                       :   Assassination by Bhagat Singh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's role in abolishing the Caliphate in Turkey is well-documented. Lord Linlithgow's association with the August Offer of 1940 is also accurate.  However, Stafford Cripps was associated with the Cripps Mission of 1942, not the Government of India Act 1935. Lala Lajpat Rai died from injuries sustained during a lathi charge in an anti-Simon Commission protest; John P. Saunders was not directly involved in this incident.  Bhagat Singh assassinated John P. Saunders, mistakenly believing him to be James Scott.  Option (a) accurately identifies the correct pairings. The other options include incorrect associations, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of historical figures and their actions. This question tests factual recall and understanding of historical figures and events.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader       Significant Demand/Contribution
1. Dadabhai Naoroji              :   Advocated for complete separation of judiciary from executive powers
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale       :   Championed the cause of Indianisation of higher administrative services
3. Surendranath Banerjea       :   First Indian woman graduate to address a Congress session
4. Mahadev Govind Ranade       :   Proposed Swarajya (self-government) within the British Empire
5. Dadabhai Naoroji              :   Introduced the concept of "drain of wealth" from India to Britain

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately reflects the contributions and demands of the early nationalist leaders. Gopal Krishna Gokhale strongly advocated for the Indianisation of higher administrative services, arguing for greater Indian representation in these crucial roles. His arguments were based on economic, political, and moral grounds.  Dadabhai Naoroji's concept of the "drain of wealth" highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, significantly shaping nationalist discourse.  Gokhale, in 1905, and Dadabhai Naoroji, in 1906,  from the Congress platform, put forward the demand for Swarajya, or self-government within the British Empire, drawing parallels to self-governing colonies like Canada and Australia.

Option (a) is incorrect as Dadabhai Naoroji's primary focus was on economic exploitation and the drain of wealth, not on judicial reforms.  Option (b) is incorrect because while Gokhale and Ranade were both significant figures, the statement about Ranade proposing Swaraj is incorrect; it was primarily Gokhale who did so from the Congress platform. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Surendranath Banerjea with the first woman graduate addressing a Congress session.  Kadambini Ganguli, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University, addressed a Congress session in 1890, not Surendranath Banerjea.  The question plays on the prominence of these figures and the interconnectedness of their contributions to create plausible, yet incorrect, pairings.


**2. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Demand                                      Associated Act/Outcome
1. Expansion and reform of Legislative Councils :  Indian Councils Act of 1909
2. Indian control over public purse             :   Indian Councils Act of 1892
3.  Larger share for Indians in councils        :   Introduction of separate electorates
4. Provincial autonomy                        :   Government of India Act, 1935
5. Self-Government within the British Empire   :   Morley-Minto Reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because it accurately links two demands with their corresponding outcomes during the early phase of the Indian National Congress. The demand for Indian control over the public purse was partially addressed by the Indian Councils Act of 1892, which increased the number of Indian members in the councils and allowed for discussion of the budget, although voting rights were limited. The demand for self-government within the British Empire, though not fully realised at the time, is directly related to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, which introduced a limited form of elected representation in the councils.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to several mismatches. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 is associated with later developments, not the early phase (1885-1905). The introduction of separate electorates is also a later development, not directly related to the demands of the early phase. Provincial autonomy was a much later demand, addressed by the Government of India Act, 1935, well beyond the timeframe of the question.  The question uses the proximity of dates and the general theme of constitutional reforms to effectively confuse the examinee.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader          Method of Political Work
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                  :   Revolutionary Terrorism
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale           :   Constitutional Agitation
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                :   Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
4. Aurobindo Ghose                  :   Passive Resistance
5. Surendranath Banerjea            :   Underground Radio Broadcasting


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the primary methods of political work employed by specific early nationalist leaders. Gopal Krishna Gokhale and other Moderates primarily focused on constitutional agitation, utilizing legal and peaceful means such as petitions, meetings, and public appeals to influence British policy. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, along with other Extremists, played a crucial role in popularizing the Swadeshi and Boycott movements, promoting the use of Indian goods and the rejection of British products. Aurobindo Ghose, a prominent figure in the early nationalist movement, is associated with the advocacy of passive resistance as a form of political action.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings. Dadabhai Naoroji, while a staunch critic of British rule, was not directly associated with revolutionary terrorism.  Surendranath Banerjea, a prominent Moderate, did not employ underground radio broadcasting as his method of political work; this is associated with later periods and different activists.  The question uses the broad category of political methods and the overlapping personalities to create effective distractors.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Key Figure(s)
1.  Partition of Bengal                       :   Lord Curzon
2.  Non-Cooperation Movement                :   Motilal Nehru
3.  Formation of the Hindustan Republican Association:  Bhagat Singh
4.  Chauri Chaura Incident                    :   Gandhi
5.  Dandi March                              :   Jawaharlal Nehru


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the key figures associated with specific events in the Indian National Movement. Lord Curzon, as Viceroy of India, was responsible for the controversial Partition of Bengal in 1905.  While Motilal Nehru was a prominent leader of the Congress, the Non-Cooperation Movement was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, although Motilal Nehru was a key supporter. The Chauri Chaura incident, a pivotal moment in the Non-Cooperation Movement, directly impacted Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement due to the violence involved.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of several mismatches.  Bhagat Singh was associated with the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, but the organization's founding involved other figures as well. The Dandi March was undeniably led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru, highlighting a crucial moment in the Civil Disobedience Movement. The question uses the overlapping timelines and the broad participation in these movements to effectively mislead the examinee.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Reform                                   Impact/Consequence
1.  Indian Councils Act of 1892                :   Complete Indian control over the budget
2.  Morley-Minto Reforms                       :   Introduction of separate electorates for Muslims
3.  Government of India Act of 1935            :   Establishment of Provincial Autonomy
4.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms              :   Introduction of Dyarchy
5.  Indian Councils Act of 1909                :   Significant expansion of elected representation in councils


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer because it accurately links the Acts and Reforms with their primary consequences. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 are correctly paired with the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, a significant development that had long-term implications for communal politics. The Government of India Act of 1935 is accurately linked to the establishment of provincial autonomy, a major step towards greater Indian self-governance. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 is correctly paired with its impact of expanding elected representation in the councils, albeit limited.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to several mismatches. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did not lead to complete Indian control over the budget; it only allowed for budget discussions.  While the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms did introduce dyarchy, the other pairings in option (b) are incorrect. Option (d) incorrectly pairs the 1892 Act with complete budget control.  The question uses the similar nature of the acts and their overlapping impacts to create challenging distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party/Group                      Prominent Leader
1. Swaraj Party                              :  C. Rajagopalachari
2. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) :  Chandrashekhar Azad
3. Forward Bloc                             :  Jawaharlal Nehru
4. Justice Party                             :  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker
5. Communist Party of India (CPI)          :  M.N. Roy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Swaraj Party was founded by Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das, not C. Rajagopalachari, who was a prominent leader of the No-Changers faction opposing council entry.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), had Chandrashekhar Azad as a key leader, making pair 2 correct. The Forward Bloc was indeed formed by Subhas Chandra Bose, not Jawaharlal Nehru; thus, pair 3 is incorrect.  The Justice Party, a Dravidian party in Madras Presidency, was not led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar), who led the Self-Respect Movement.  Pair 4 is incorrect. M.N. Roy played a significant role in the early formation and development of the Communist Party of India (CPI), making pair 5 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify correct pairings amidst plausible distractors.  The inclusion of leaders closely associated with the movements but not their founders serves as effective distractors.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                       Location
1. Kakori Conspiracy                          :   Kanpur
2. Chittagong Armoury Raid                  :   Allahabad
3.  Formation of the Provisional Government of Free India :  Delhi
4.  First session of the Indian National Congress:  Calcutta

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kakori Conspiracy, a significant event in the Indian revolutionary movement, indeed took place near Lucknow, making pair 1 correct.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid occurred in Chittagong, Bengal, not Allahabad; therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Provisional Government of Free India was formed in Singapore, not Delhi, making pair 3 incorrect. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay, not Calcutta; therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related locations associated with historical events. The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect locations increases the difficulty level.  The question assesses factual recall abilities and the potential for confusion regarding the geographical locations of key events in the Indian freedom struggle.


**3. With reference to the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                             Year
1.  Non-Cooperation Movement               :   1930
2.  Salt Satyagraha                           :   1920
3.  Quit India Movement                     :   1942
4.  The Cripps Mission                       :   1947


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement commenced in 1920, not 1930, making pair 1 incorrect. The Salt Satyagraha, a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement, was launched in 1930, not 1920, making pair 2 incorrect. The Quit India Movement is correctly associated with 1942, making pair 3 correct. The Cripps Mission arrived in India in 1942, not 1947, making pair 4 incorrect.  This question tests factual recall of the chronology of major events in the Indian independence movement. The close proximity of some incorrect years to the correct ones makes this a challenging question. The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the timeline of significant events in the Indian independence movement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Role/Association
1.  Motilal Nehru                            :  President, All India Khilafat Committee
2.  Mahatma Gandhi                          :   Leader of the Bardoli Satyagraha
3.  Vallabhbhai Patel                        :    President, Indian National Congress during the Quit India Movement
4.  Subhas Chandra Bose                    :   President of the Congress, 1938-39


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi, not Motilal Nehru, was the president of the All India Khilafat Committee, making pair 1 incorrect.  Vallabhbhai Patel, not Mahatma Gandhi, led the Bardoli Satyagraha, making pair 2 incorrect.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, not Vallabhbhai Patel, was the president of the Indian National Congress during the Quit India Movement, making pair 3 incorrect.  Subhas Chandra Bose was indeed elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1938, making pair 4 correct. This question tests factual knowledge of individuals and their roles within specific events and movements of the Indian freedom struggle. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible considering the close association of the individuals with the events mentioned, thereby raising the difficulty level.  The question requires precise knowledge and avoids ambiguity.



**5. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Movement             Key Proponent
1.  Gandhian Philosophy of Satyagraha    :   Jawaharlal Nehru
2.  Marxist and Socialist Ideas            :   M.N. Roy
3.  Revolutionary Terrorism with a tilt towards socialism:  Bhagat Singh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru, while a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress, was not the key proponent of the Gandhian philosophy of Satyagraha. Mahatma Gandhi is the primary figure associated with this philosophy, making pair 1 incorrect. M.N. Roy was indeed influential in spreading Marxist and socialist ideas in India, making pair 2 correct.  Bhagat Singh and his associates were prominent figures in the revolutionary movement that leaned towards socialist ideals, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the ability to link political ideologies and movements with their key proponents. The distractor uses a prominent figure associated with the movement but not its primary advocate, raising the difficulty level.  The question assesses deeper understanding of ideological influences within the freedom struggle.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                     Action/Association
1.  Ramprasad Bismil                  :  Kakori Conspiracy Case
2.  Surya Sen                           :  Chittagong Armoury Raid
3.  Bhagat Singh & Batukeshwar Dutt :  Bombing of Central Legislative Assembly
4.  Muzaffar Ahmad, S.A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani, Nalini Gupta :  Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case
5.  Pritilata Waddedar                 :  Dharasana Salt Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ramprasad Bismil was a key figure in the Kakori Conspiracy, a revolutionary act involving a train robbery. Surya Sen masterminded the Chittagong Armoury Raid, a significant armed rebellion in Bengal. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt are renowned for throwing bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly as a protest. Muzaffar Ahmad, S.A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani, and Nalini Gupta were involved in the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case, a communist-related incident.  Option (d) is incorrect because Pritilata Waddedar was associated with the revolutionary activities in Bengal, notably a raid, but not with the Dharasana Salt Satyagraha, which was part of the Civil Disobedience Movement led by Gandhi. The other options are incomplete, missing at least one correct pairing.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and events within the Indian independence movement, demanding precise knowledge of individuals' roles in specific incidents.  The inclusion of Pritilata Waddedar, a lesser-known but significant revolutionary figure, adds to the question's difficulty.


**2. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Leader/Group             Position on Office Acceptance in 1937 Elections
1.  Jawaharlal Nehru                   :   Opposed office acceptance
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose               :   Initially opposed, later supported
3.  Gandhi                             :   Initially opposed, later gave approval
4.  Congress Socialists and Communists:   Opposed office acceptance
5.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, S. Satyamurthy, B.C. Roy : Supported constructive work


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nehru, along with Bose and the Congress Socialists and Communists, initially strongly opposed office acceptance in the 1937 provincial elections, viewing it as a compromise with the colonial system. Gandhi, while initially hesitant, eventually gave his approval for Congress to participate in forming ministries, acknowledging the strategic value of utilizing legislative power.  Option (a) is incorrect because Bose's position evolved from initial opposition to eventual support for office acceptance.  Option (c) and (d) incorrectly associate the group of M.A. Ansari et al with opposing office acceptance; their focus was on constitutional struggle and elections but not necessarily on office acceptance per se. The question assesses the understanding of nuanced positions within the Congress leadership during a crucial phase of the freedom struggle, testing the candidate's ability to analyze differing viewpoints and their historical context. The inclusion of lesser-known names in option (d) adds to the difficulty.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Act                      Description
1.  Federal Level: Executive             :   Governor-General could act in his individual judgment
2.  Provincial Autonomy                 :   Replaced dyarchy
3.  Federal Level: Legislature           :   Council of States had direct elections, Federal Assembly had indirect elections
4.  All India Federation                 :   Never formed due to non-fulfillment of conditions
5.  Provincial Level: Legislature        :   40% of the budget was non-votable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Governor-General under the 1935 Act held significant individual judgment powers, especially regarding matters of security. Provincial autonomy replaced the earlier dyarchy system, granting provinces more self-governance. The proposed All-India Federation never materialized due to the non-participation of princely states. A significant portion of the provincial budget remained non-votable under the Act. Option (c) is incorrect because the election process for the Federal and Council of States was asymmetrical (indirect and direct respectively). The question tests detailed knowledge of the Government of India Act 1935, requiring precise understanding of its features and the reasons behind its limitations.  The inclusion of both federal and provincial aspects makes the question more challenging.


**4. With reference to the Swarajist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Swarajist Leader/Group               Characteristic/Action
1.  Motilal Nehru                         :   Secretary of the Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party
2.  C.R. Das                             :   President of the Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party
3.  Vithalbhai Patel                    :   Elected Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly
4.  Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malaviya, N.C. Kelkar:   Responsivists, advocated cooperation with the government
5.  C. Rajagopalachari                   :  Leader of the No-Changers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Motilal Nehru served as a secretary of the Swarajya Party, while C.R. Das was its president. Vithalbhai Patel's election as Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly was a significant achievement for the Swarajists.  Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malaviya, and N.C. Kelkar represented the Responsivist faction within the Swarajist party, advocating for cooperation with the government. C. Rajagopalachari was a prominent leader of the No-Changers, the faction opposing council entry. All the pairs are correctly matched. The question assesses knowledge of the Swarajist movement, its leadership, and internal factions, demanding recall of specific individuals and their roles. The inclusion of both Swarajists and No-Changers adds a layer of complexity.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Policy                               Year
1.  Gandhi-Irwin Pact                        :  1932
2.  Communal Award                          :  1932
3.  Poona Pact                               :  1931
4.  Government of India Act, 1935         :  1935
5.  Second Round Table Conference          :  1931


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Communal Award was announced in 1932. The Government of India Act, 1935, came into effect in that year. The Second Round Table Conference was held in 1931. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in 1931, and the Poona Pact was concluded in 1932. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the Second Round Table Conference. Option (b) incorrectly places the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and Poona Pact in the wrong years. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly places the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in 1932 and the Poona Pact in 1931.  This question tests factual recall of important dates and events related to the Indian independence movement, focusing on key agreements and constitutional developments.  The close proximity of some dates makes the question challenging.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                    Movement/Organization
1.  Mohan Singh                           :   Indian National Army (Initial Phase)
2.  Rash Behari Bose                       :   Indian Independence League (Tokyo)
3.  Aruna Asaf Ali                         :   Forward Bloc
4.  Chittu Pandey                           :   Prati Sarkar (Satara)
5.  Jayaprakash Narayan                    :   Quit India Movement (Underground Activities)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Mohan Singh played a crucial role in the initial formation of the Indian National Army (INA) before Subhas Chandra Bose took over.  Rash Behari Bose established the Indian Independence League in Tokyo, laying the groundwork for Subhas Bose's later leadership of the INA. Jayaprakash Narayan was a prominent figure in the underground activities during the Quit India Movement.  The other options are incorrect because Aruna Asaf Ali was associated with the Quit India Movement, but not specifically the Forward Bloc in the context of the movement, and Chittu Pandey led the parallel government in Ballia, not the Prati Sarkar in Satara.  Option (b) accurately reflects the established historical roles of these individuals in the given movements.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and their involvement in significant events of the Indian independence movement.  Distractors are included by introducing plausible but incorrect pairings, demanding precise knowledge rather than general awareness.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Plan                                     Key Figure/Organization
1.  Shimla Conference                         :   Lord Wavell
2.  Cripps Mission                             :   Jawaharlal Nehru
3.  Rajagopalachari Formula                    :   Muslim League
4.  Desai-Liaqat Pact                          :   Bhulabhai Desai
5.  Cabinet Mission Plan                       :   Clement Attlee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) All five
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) All five

**Explanation:**

The Shimla Conference was convened by Lord Wavell.  The Cripps Mission involved Jawaharlal Nehru in negotiations on behalf of the Congress. The Rajagopalachari Formula was a significant attempt to address the Muslim League's demands.  The Desai-Liaqat Pact involved Bhulabhai Desai in negotiations. The Cabinet Mission Plan was initiated under Clement Attlee's leadership as Prime Minister of Britain.  All the pairings correctly link the events or plans with the relevant figures or organizations. The question tests factual recall of key events and personalities in the lead-up to Indian independence. The inclusion of multiple correct pairs and plausible distractors increases the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of historical details to arrive at the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Feature/Impact
1.  Government of India Act, 1935           :   Provincial Autonomy
2.  Vernacular Press Act, 1878              :   Increased press freedom
3.  Communal Award, 1932                   :   Separate electorates for depressed classes
4.  Permanent Settlement                      :   Ryotwari system
5.  Ryotwari System                           :   Direct revenue collection from cultivators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced provincial autonomy. The Communal Award of 1932 established separate electorates, including for the depressed classes. The Ryotwari System involved direct revenue collection from cultivators. Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. The Vernacular Press Act, 1878, restricted press freedom, not increased it. The Permanent Settlement was a distinct system of land revenue, not the same as the Ryotwari System.  Option (a) accurately identifies the correct matches, requiring a detailed understanding of British administrative and revenue policies in India and their impact.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar but distinct concepts and policies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                      Association/Role
1.  Subhas Chandra Bose                      :   Azad Hind Fauj
2.  Bhagat Singh                              :   Hindustan Republican Association
3.  Gandhi                                   :   Non-Cooperation Movement
4.  C. Rajagopalachari                        :   Swarajist Party
5.  Jawaharlal Nehru                          :   Quit India Resolution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) All five
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose was the Supreme Commander of the Azad Hind Fauj (INA). Bhagat Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (later HSRA). Mahatma Gandhi led the Non-Cooperation Movement. Jawaharlal Nehru played a key role in drafting the Quit India Resolution. Option 4 is incorrect; C. Rajagopalachari was associated with the No-Changers, not the Swarajist Party. Option (b) accurately reflects the established historical associations between the individuals and their roles in the national movement.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their contributions to different phases of the Indian independence struggle. The inclusion of a distractor involving a closely related figure and a different political stance enhances the question's difficulty.


**5. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                            Characteristic
1.  Quit India Movement                      :   Primarily an urban movement
2.  Non-Cooperation Movement              :   Involved widespread boycott of government institutions
3.  Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34) :   Salt Satyagraha as a key event
4.  RIN Mutiny                               :   Triggered by racial discrimination
5.  Tebhaga Movement                         :   Focused on land reforms in Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement involved a widespread boycott of British institutions. The Civil Disobedience Movement prominently featured the Salt Satyagraha. The RIN Mutiny was partly triggered by issues of racial discrimination and unequal pay. The Tebhaga Movement focused on land reforms in Bengal.  Option 1 is incorrect; the Quit India Movement, while having urban participation, was also a significant rural revolt. Option (a) accurately reflects the characteristics of the movements listed, requiring knowledge of the specific nature and key events associated with each. The distractor in option 1 tests the candidate's nuanced understanding of the Quit India Movement’s geographical spread.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session              Location
1.  Lahore Congress Session     :   Ahmedabad
2.  Calcutta Congress Session   :   Lahore
3.  Karachi Congress Session     :   Bombay

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lahore Congress session, where the declaration of Purna Swaraj was made, took place in Lahore in December 1929. The Calcutta session, where the Nehru Report was approved and the demand for Purna Swaraj gained momentum, was held in Calcutta in December 1928.  The Karachi session, which endorsed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and passed resolutions on fundamental rights and the national economic program, occurred in Karachi in March 1931. Option (c) correctly identifies the location of the Karachi Congress session. Options (a) and (b) incorrectly match the locations of the Lahore and Calcutta sessions, respectively. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of significant Congress sessions and their locations, crucial for understanding the evolution of the Indian National Congress's political strategy during the freedom struggle.


**2. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                         Key Event/Activity
1.  Dandi                          :   No-tax campaign
2.  Dharasana Salt Works         :   Salt Satyagraha
3.  Chauri Chaura                 :   Violent clash between protestors and police

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dandi March, a pivotal moment in the Civil Disobedience Movement, culminated in Gandhi's symbolic salt production at Dandi, defying the British salt tax.  The Dharasana Salt Works witnessed a significant act of civil disobedience through salt Satyagraha, met with brutal police repression.  The Chauri Chaura incident involved a violent clash between protestors and police, leading Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. Option (b) accurately reflects the events at Dharasana and Chauri Chaura. Option (a) is incorrect because the Dandi March was not primarily focused on a no-tax campaign, though tax resistance was a part of the broader movement. Option (c) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of key events and locations during the Civil Disobedience Movement, highlighting the diverse forms of resistance employed and their significance in shaping the course of the freedom struggle.


**3. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following pairs:**

   Conference                     Key Participant
1. First Round Table Conference  :   M.K. Gandhi
2. Second Round Table Conference :   B.R. Ambedkar
3. Third Round Table Conference  :   M.R. Jayakar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The First Round Table Conference (1930-31) was boycotted by the Indian National Congress, including Mahatma Gandhi.  The Second Round Table Conference (1931) saw Gandhi as the sole representative of the Congress. The Third Round Table Conference (1932) was also boycotted by the Congress, but M.R. Jayakar, representing Hindu interests, participated. B.R. Ambedkar represented the Depressed Classes in the Second and Third Round Table Conferences. Option (c) correctly identifies M.R. Jayakar's participation in the Third Round Table Conference. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect as Gandhi did not participate in the First Conference and Ambedkar was present in the Second and Third. Option (d) is partially correct but not fully correct.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the key participants in the Round Table Conferences, highlighting the complexities of inter-community negotiations and the Congress's evolving strategy during this period.  It also tests the ability to sift through multiple plausible distractors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                 Significant Action/Stance during the Quit India Movement
1.  Aruna Asaf Ali                :   Led the underground radio in Bombay
2.  Jayaprakash Narayan           :   Participated in the Tamluk parallel government
3.  Usha Mehta                    :   Hoisted the Congress flag after arrests of leaders
4.  Chittu Pandey                  :   Established a parallel government in Ballia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aruna Asaf Ali played a prominent role in the Quit India Movement, including activities that involved the underground movement. Usha Mehta famously ran an underground radio station in Bombay during the movement. Chittu Pandey established a parallel government in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh.  Jayaprakash Narayan was involved in underground activities and organizing resistance, but his direct involvement with the Tamluk parallel government is not as definitively documented as the other figures' actions.  Option (c) correctly matches Aruna Asaf Ali, Usha Mehta and Chittu Pandey with their known actions. Option (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrect pairings or fail to include all the correctly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their roles in the Quit India Movement, emphasizing the diverse forms of resistance and the decentralized nature of the movement.


**5. With reference to the Partition of India, consider the following pairs:**

  Province/Region                 Outcome after Partition
1.  Bengal                         :   Remained undivided
2.  Punjab                          :   Partitioned into East and West Punjab
3.  Sylhet District                :   Joined Pakistan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Partition of India resulted in the division of Bengal and Punjab.  Sylhet district, initially part of Assam, joined East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) after a referendum.  Option (c) correctly identifies the partitioning of Punjab and Sylhet's accession to Pakistan. Option (a) is incorrect as Bengal was partitioned. Option (b) is partially correct but doesn't include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect as only two pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical consequences of the Partition of India, highlighting the complexities of redrawing boundaries and the impact on different regions.  It also assesses the ability to recall specific details about the partition process.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Individual/Group               Key Demand/Position Regarding the Communal Award
1.  B.R. Ambedkar                 :   Opposed separate electorates for Depressed Classes
2.  Gandhi                         :   Supported separate electorates for Depressed Classes
3.  Congress                       :   Initially opposed the Communal Award

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

B.R. Ambedkar initially championed separate electorates for the depressed classes, believing it would provide them with better political representation.  Gandhi vehemently opposed separate electorates, fearing it would further marginalize the depressed classes and hinder their integration into Hindu society. The Congress, while initially opposed to the Communal Award as a whole due to its divisive nature, later negotiated the Poona Pact.  Option (c) correctly matches Ambedkar's initial support for separate electorates and the Congress' initial opposition to the Communal Award. Option (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the stances of the key figures involved. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different viewpoints regarding the Communal Award, a crucial event in the lead-up to Indian independence, and the complex negotiations between different political actors.  It requires careful consideration of nuanced positions.


**7. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                    Characteristic
1.  Provincial Autonomy                      :   Dyarchy continued
2.  Federal Structure                         :   Never fully implemented
3.  Communal Electorates                    :   Abolished

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system.  The Act's proposed federal structure, including the involvement of princely states, was never fully implemented.  The Act retained, and in some cases expanded, the system of communal electorates. Option (b) correctly states that the federal structure of the 1935 Act was never fully implemented. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect as they present incorrect information regarding provincial autonomy and communal electorates. Option (d) is partially correct but does not include the fully correct pair. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key features of the Government of India Act, 1935, its impact on Indian politics, and its lasting legacy.  It requires a thorough understanding of the Act's provisions and their practical implications.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Leader                                  Role/Position
1.  Lord Irwin                             :   Viceroy during the Second Round Table Conference
2.  Lord Wavell                           :   Viceroy during the Cripps Mission
3.  Clement Attlee                         :   British Prime Minister who announced the 1947 plan for independence.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lord Irwin served as Viceroy during the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, which preceded the Second Round Table Conference. Lord Wavell was Viceroy when the Cripps Mission visited India in 1942. Clement Attlee, as British Prime Minister, made the crucial announcement in 1947, setting a timeline for the transfer of power and foreshadowing the partition of India. Option (c) correctly identifies Lord Irwin's role related to the Second Round Table Conference and Clement Attlee's role in the 1947 declaration.  Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but do not include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect as one pair is wrongly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key British officials and their roles during the crucial period leading up to Indian independence. It demands precise knowledge of the chronology of events and the individuals involved.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Event                                     Year
1.  The Indian Independence Act                 :   1935
2.  The Government of India Act, 1935          :   1947
3.  The Communal Award                        :   1932

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Independence Act, which formalized the partition of India and granted independence to India and Pakistan, was enacted in 1947. The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced significant constitutional changes in British India, including provincial autonomy. The Communal Award, which addressed separate electorates for minority communities, was announced in 1932. Option (b) correctly identifies the year of the Communal Award. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the years of the Indian Independence Act and the Government of India Act, 1935. Option (d) is partially correct but does not include the fully correct pair.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of important legislative acts and events during the British Raj and their chronological order, a fundamental aspect of understanding the historical context of Indian independence.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Organization              Prominent Leader/Founder
1. Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha     :    Bhagat Singh
2. Ghadar Party                       :    Lala Lajpat Rai
3. All India States’ Peoples’ Conference :    Jawaharlal Nehru (President in 1939)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The All India States’ Peoples’ Conference was indeed founded in December 1927 and Jawaharlal Nehru assumed its presidency in 1939, marking a significant step in the Congress's engagement with the princely states' movements.  This correctly matches pair 3.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. The Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, while advocating for youth, peasants, and workers, did not have Bhagat Singh as its sole or primary founder; it had a broader leadership. Similarly, Lala Lajpat Rai was associated with the Ghadar Party, but he wasn't its sole founder; the party was formed in the USA by a diaspora of Indian revolutionaries.  Therefore, only pair 3 represents a completely accurate match. Option (a) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect as two out of three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the precise leadership and founding details of various nationalist organizations, thereby distinguishing between association and direct founding/presidency.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                  Year
1. Lucknow Pact                           :    1916
2. Formation of Swaraj Party             :    1923
3. Jallianwala Bagh Massacre             :    1920
4. Death of Bal Gangadhar Tilak         :    1920

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Lucknow Pact, a significant agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League, occurred in 1916.  The death of Bal Gangadhar Tilak also took place in 1920. These two pairs are correctly matched.  However, the other pairs contain incorrect years. The formation of the Swaraj Party happened in 1923, not 1922, and the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre occurred in 1919, not 1920. The question tests factual recall, specifically the ability to accurately associate historical events with their corresponding years. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include pairs with inaccurate years.  The deliberate inclusion of close but incorrect years enhances the difficulty level. The question demands precise knowledge of Indian history and the ability to distinguish between similar years.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Province                            Outcome of 1937 Provincial Elections
1.  United Provinces                   :   Congress formed a government
2.  Bengal                              :   Muslim League formed a government
3.  North-West Frontier Province     :   Congress formed a government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In the 1937 provincial elections, the Congress secured majorities and formed governments in several provinces, including the United Provinces and the North-West Frontier Province.  This makes pairs 1 and 3 correct. However, in Bengal, the Congress did not win an outright majority, and a coalition government was formed without the Congress's participation.  This makes pair 2 incorrect. The Muslim League did not form a government in Bengal in 1937. The question assesses factual recall of the 1937 election results and the ability to differentiate between outright victories and coalition governments. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair regarding the outcome of the 1937 provincial elections in Bengal. The question tests specific knowledge of election outcomes and the political landscape of British India in the 1930s, requiring precise recall of historical facts.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Nationalist Leader       Stance on the Government of India Act, 1935
1. Mahatma Gandhi                 :   Complete rejection
2. Jawaharlal Nehru                :   Conditional acceptance
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose           :   Complete rejection

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Both Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose vehemently opposed the Government of India Act, 1935, viewing it as inadequate and failing to address the core demands for self-rule and independence.  This makes pairs 1 and 3 correct.  However, Jawaharlal Nehru's stance was more nuanced; while critical, he didn't outright reject the Act.  His position involved evaluating the Act's potential for leveraging limited opportunities for political action. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the different approaches taken by key Congress leaders towards the 1935 Act, requiring an understanding of their political strategies and ideologies. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits Nehru's nuanced stance. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes an inaccurate representation of Nehru’s perspective. Option (d) is incorrect as it only considers one leader’s viewpoint, ignoring the others. The question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to differentiate between varying perspectives on a significant political event, requiring more than mere factual recall.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                         Key Demand
1.  Second Civil Disobedience Movement :   Complete Independence
2.  Quit India Movement                  :   Immediate Dominion Status
3.  Non-Cooperation Movement          :   Annulment of Rowlatt Act and redressal of Punjab wrongs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Second Civil Disobedience Movement, launched with the Dandi March, aimed to challenge British laws and ultimately aimed at achieving Swaraj or self-rule, although complete independence wasn't explicitly the immediate demand. The Non-Cooperation Movement's central demands included the annulment of the Rowlatt Act and the addressing of injustices in the Punjab. These two pairs accurately reflect the primary objectives of those movements.  The Quit India Movement, however, primarily focused on complete independence rather than immediate dominion status. The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of the primary goals of different movements and the ability to differentiate between the immediate and ultimate aims. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one mismatched pair regarding the main demand of the movements. The question tests knowledge of the Indian independence movement and demands a higher-order understanding of the evolution of nationalist goals.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Group                     Prominent Leader
1.  Swarajist Party                     :   Motilal Nehru
2.  Hindustan Republican Association :   Ramprasad Bismil
3.  Forward Bloc                       :   Subhas Chandra Bose
4.  Congress Socialist Party           :   Jayaprakash Narayan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Swarajist Party was formed by Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das after the Gaya session of the Congress in 1922, following disagreements over the strategy of council entry. Motilal Nehru served as one of the secretaries of this party.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was founded in 1924 with Ramprasad Bismil as a key founding member.  Subhas Chandra Bose led the Forward Bloc, a political party he formed within the Congress in 1939 after his resignation as Congress President.  Jayaprakash Narayan was a prominent leader of the Congress Socialist Party, a left-wing group within the Indian National Congress advocating for socialist ideals within the broader nationalist movement.  All four pairs accurately link the political group with a prominent leader associated with its formation or leadership. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                     Year
1.  Kakori Conspiracy                  :   1928
2.  Chittagong Armoury Raid           :   1930
3.  Lahore Conspiracy Case             :   1929
4.  Formation of the HSRA             :   1928


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kakori Conspiracy, a robbery orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association, took place in 1925. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, occurred in April 1930. The Lahore Conspiracy Case, which resulted in the trial and execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru, commenced in 1929. The Hindustan Republican Association was reorganized into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in September 1928.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the years of at least one of the events.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                           Contribution to the Indian National Movement
1.  Rani Gaidinliu                      :   Led the Khudai Khidmatgars in the NWFP
2.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan          :   Led a tribal revolt in Manipur and Nagaland
3.  B.R. Ambedkar                     :   Championed the cause of Dalits and advocated for their rights
4.  Vallabhbhai Patel                  :   Led the Bardoli Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rani Gaidinliu led a tribal revolt in Manipur and Nagaland, not the Khudai Khidmatgars. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the Frontier Gandhi, led the Khudai Khidmatgars, a non-violent Pashtun movement in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). B.R. Ambedkar's significant contributions to the Indian National Movement included his relentless advocacy for the rights and empowerment of Dalits (untouchables). Vallabhbhai Patel effectively led the Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement in Gujarat.  Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 correctly match the individual with their contribution to the Indian National Movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate individuals with movements or causes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Resolution                      Key Provision/Outcome
1.  Government of India Act, 1935     :   Established Provincial Autonomy
2.  Poona Pact                         :   Introduced separate electorates for Dalits
3.  Communal Award                    :   Abandoned separate electorates for Dalits
4.  Nehru Report                       :   Advocated for Dominion Status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system. The Poona Pact, a significant agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, resulted in the abandonment of separate electorates for Dalits (scheduled castes), instead increasing their reserved seats in the legislatures. The Communal Award, announced by the British government, did *introduce* separate electorates for Dalits, among other minority groups. The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, advocated for dominion status for India within the British Commonwealth. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the key provisions or outcomes of at least one of the acts/resolutions.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                     Role/Action
1.  Motilal Nehru                           :   Led the Awadh Kisan Movement
2.  C. Rajagopalachari                     :   Participated in the Salt Satyagraha
3.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :   Announced the withdrawal of the movement after Chauri Chaura
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                       :   Led the Bardoli Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Awadh Kisan Movement was primarily led by figures like Baba Ramchandra and not Motilal Nehru. While C. Rajagopalachari was a significant figure in the Indian National Congress, he is more prominently associated with later movements like the Individual Satyagraha.  Mahatma Gandhi's decision to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement following the Chauri Chaura incident is a well-documented fact. Vallabhbhai Patel led the Bardoli Satyagraha, not Jawaharlal Nehru. Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches the leader with their role or action during the Non-Cooperation Movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link leaders to events or actions.


**6. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                 Key Demand/Contribution
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                       :   Championed the cause of separate electorates for Dalits
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                 :   Advocated for Swarajya (self-government)
3.  Pherozeshah Mehta                     :   Promoted the 'Drain of Wealth' theory
4.  R.C. Dutt                              :   Led the Swadeshi Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji is known for his articulation of the 'Drain of Wealth' theory, highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule, not for championing separate electorates for Dalits. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader, advocated for Swarajya (self-government) within the British Empire. Pherozeshah Mehta, another key figure in the early Congress, also contributed to the economic critique of British rule, alongside Dadabhai Naoroji and R.C. Dutt.  The Swadeshi Movement was a mass movement involving many leaders, and R.C. Dutt, while contributing to the economic critique, was not its primary leader.  Therefore, only pair 2 correctly links the leader with their key demand or contribution during the early Congress phase. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly attribute demands or contributions to the listed leaders.


**7. With reference to the revolutionary movements of the early 20th century, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Group                  Location of Major Activity
1.  Anushilan Samiti                  :   Punjab
2.  Abhinav Bharat                     :   Maharashtra
3.  Hindustan Republican Association :   Bengal
4.  Khudai Khidmatgars               :   NWFP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Anushilan Samiti was primarily active in Bengal, not Punjab.  V.D. Savarkar's Abhinav Bharat was a revolutionary organization based in Maharashtra. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was largely active in Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar, not Bengal. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan's Khudai Khidmatgars operated in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly associate the organizations with their locations of activity.


**8. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Description
1.  Provincial Autonomy                       :   Dyarchy continued at the provincial level
2.  Federal Structure                         :   Included British Indian provinces and princely states
3.  Separate Electorates                      :   Abolished for all communities
4.  Bicameral Legislature at the Centre       :   Council of States and Federal Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, established provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy.  The proposed federal structure of the Act included both British Indian provinces and princely states, though the federation itself was never fully implemented.  The Act retained the system of separate electorates for various communities, not abolishing them. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the center—the Council of States (upper house) and the Federal Assembly (lower house). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 correctly describe features of the Government of India Act, 1935. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent at least one aspect of the Act's provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Post-Independence Challenge           Government Response
1. Territorial integration of princely states :  Establishment of a Partition Council
2. Rehabilitation of refugees               :  Creation of a Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation
3. Communal riots                         :  Deployment of a 50,000-strong Boundary Force
4. Division of financial resources         :  Nehru-Liaquat Pact

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The immediate challenges facing independent India included the integration of princely states, the massive refugee crisis stemming from partition, and widespread communal violence.  The government responded to each of these with specific measures. The integration of princely states, a complex political and administrative task, saw the establishment of a Partition Council, though its effectiveness was limited. The refugee crisis, involving millions displaced, necessitated the formation of a Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation to oversee resettlement and aid distribution.  The communal riots, fueled by the partition itself, prompted the assembly of a substantial Boundary Force (though its effectiveness was hampered by internal divisions). Option 4 is incorrect because the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, while addressing minority issues and communal harmony, primarily focused on resolving problems between India and Pakistan, particularly in Bengal, rather than directly addressing the division of financial resources as a separate post-partition issue.  The financial division was addressed through a separate partition council focusing on cash balances and public debt.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete representations of the government's multifaceted response to the challenges of the newly independent nation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                 Position/Role in Post-Independence India
1.  Jawaharlal Nehru                      :  Governor-General
2.  Lord Mountbatten                     :  First Prime Minister
3.  Rajendra Prasad                      :  First President
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel              : Deputy Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Rajendra Prasad was indeed the first President of India, a position established upon the nation becoming a republic on January 26, 1950.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel served as the Deputy Prime Minister under Jawaharlal Nehru until his death in 1950.  Options 1 and 2 are incorrect.  Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India, not the Governor-General. Lord Mountbatten served as the first Governor-General of independent India, but not as the first Prime Minister.  The Governor-General's role was largely ceremonial, while the Prime Minister held executive power. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 represent accurate pairings of individuals with their respective roles in post-independence India. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings based on the conflation of the roles of Prime Minister and Governor-General in the early years of independence.


**3. With reference to the challenges faced by newly independent India, consider the following pairs:**

    Challenge Category                  Specific Challenge
1. Immediate Challenges             :  Framing of the Constitution
2. Medium-term Challenges           :  Communal riots
3. Long-term Challenges              :  Poverty alleviation
4. Challenges associated with partition:  Division of defence personnel and equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Communal riots were an immediate and severe challenge in the aftermath of partition, falling under the category of immediate challenges. The division of defence personnel and equipment was a direct consequence of the partition, making it a challenge directly associated with the partition process. Option 1 is incorrect:  Framing the Constitution was a medium-term challenge, requiring time and deliberation, not an immediate crisis. Option 3 is also incorrect because while poverty alleviation was a long-term goal, it wasn’t categorized separately from other long-term challenges, such as national integration and economic development. Option 1 is also mismatched, as framing the constitution was a medium-term goal, not an immediate concern. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 correctly match the challenge category with the specific challenge.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly categorize challenges, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the temporal context and the interconnected nature of the challenges faced by India post-independence.


**4. With reference to the Radcliffe Line and its consequences, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor Considered in Delimitation     Correct Assessment
1. Religious demography                :  Primary deciding factor
2. River boundaries                     :  Completely disregarded
3. Administrative units                  :  Considered but not prioritized
4. Economic viability                  :  Given significant weight


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Radcliffe Line, drawn hastily to divide India and Pakistan, primarily considered religious demography as the deciding factor, though other factors were also considered.  Administrative units were taken into account but were not prioritized over the religious distribution of the population. Option 2 is incorrect because while rivers were ideally suited as natural boundaries, they were not completely disregarded during the delimitation process. They were considered along with other factors, though not always successfully prioritized. Option 4 is incorrect because while economic viability was a factor that ideally should have been given much greater weight, the chaotic and rushed nature of the process meant that it was not given significant weight in the actual delimitation.  Option (a) is incomplete, while options (c) and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the consideration given to river boundaries and economic viability in the delimitation process.  Therefore, only options 1 and 3 represent accurate assessments of the factors considered during the delimitation of the Radcliffe Line.


**5. With reference to the first government of independent India, consider the following pairs:**

    Minister                               Portfolio
1.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel             :  Minister of Defence
2.  Jagjivan Ram                          :  Minister of Labour
3.  Shyama Prasad Mukherjee             :  Minister of Finance
4.  John Mathai                           : Minister of Railways and Transport


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Jagjivan Ram held the portfolio of Labour in the first independent Indian government, a significant appointment reflecting the government's attention to labor issues.  John Mathai served as the Minister of Railways and Transport.  Options 1 and 3 are incorrect. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the Deputy Prime Minister and held the portfolios of Home Affairs and States, not Defence.  Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the Minister of Industries and Supplies, not Finance. The portfolios of Defence and Finance were held by Sardar Baldev Singh and R.K. Shanmukham Chetty respectively. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the importance of precise factual knowledge regarding the composition of India's first cabinet.  Only option (b) correctly identifies the ministers and their respective portfolios.


**6. With reference to the challenges associated with the partition of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Resource Division         Specific Issue
1. Division of civil government       :  Allocation of public debt
2. Division of defence resources      :  Transfer of Muslim-majority units to Pakistan
3. Division of finances                :  Settlement of boundaries between India and Pakistan
4. Division of military assets          :  Options given to civil servants regarding transfer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The division of defence resources involved the complex task of transferring military units, with a significant focus on transferring Muslim-majority units to Pakistan to minimize potential conflict.  The division of civil government personnel involved giving options to civil servants about transferring to either India or Pakistan. Option 1 is incorrect because the allocation of public debt was a specific issue under the broader category of division of finances, not civil government. Option 3 is incorrect: The settlement of boundaries was a separate process, addressed by the Radcliffe Boundary Commission, not directly under the umbrella of resource division. Option 4 is also mismatched as this process was part of the division of civil government, not military assets. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 accurately reflect the specific issues arising from different types of resource divisions during the partition. Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate a misunderstanding of the distinct processes involved in the partition of resources.


**7. With reference to the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision of the Pact                     Correct Interpretation
1. Appointment of ministers from minority communities :  At both central and provincial levels
2. Establishment of minority commissions             :  Primarily to investigate communal riots in Bengal
3. Creation of an agency for recovering abducted women :  Widely criticized by scholars
4. Encouraging refugees to return to their original homes:  Successfully achieved widespread repatriation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Nehru-Liaquat Pact aimed to improve relations between India and Pakistan and address the plight of minorities.  It included provisions for appointing ministers from minority communities at both the central and provincial levels to ensure their representation in government. The pact also provided for the establishment of minority commissions, primarily focusing on investigating the causes of communal riots, especially in Bengal, a region severely affected by the violence. The creation of an agency to recover and rehabilitate abducted women was a controversial aspect of the pact, facing criticism from scholars for its impracticality and potential for further harm. Option 4 is incorrect because the pact's aim of encouraging refugees to return to their original homes was largely unsuccessful due to a lack of trust and the changed circumstances on the ground.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete or include inaccurate interpretations of the pact's provisions and consequences, highlighting the need for nuanced understanding of historical agreements and their impact.


**8. With reference to the individuals involved in the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                                 Association
1.  Nathuram Godse                         :  Member, Indian National Army
2.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :  Leader, Non-Cooperation Movement
3.  Sir Cyril Radcliffe                       :  Chairman, Boundary Commission
4.  Liaquat Ali Khan                        :  First Prime Minister of Pakistan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi was the undisputed leader of the Non-Cooperation Movement, a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence.  Sir Cyril Radcliffe headed the Boundary Commission, tasked with the difficult and ultimately controversial task of demarcating the borders between India and Pakistan.  Liaquat Ali Khan served as the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, a crucial figure in the early years of that nation's history. Option 1 is incorrect: Nathuram Godse was the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, not a member of the Indian National Army.  The INA was led by Subhas Chandra Bose. Option (a) is therefore incorrect, and option (d) contains an incorrect pairing. Option (c) is incomplete. Thus, only options 2, 3, and 4 represent accurate pairings, demonstrating an understanding of key figures and their roles in the period leading up to and immediately following India's independence.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

  Event                                    Key Figure
1.  Dandi March                             :  Jawaharlal Nehru
2.  Quit India Movement                     :  Mahatma Gandhi
3.  Individual Satyagraha                  :  Vinoba Bhave (First Satyagrahi)
4.  Lahore Congress Session (1929)         :  Subhas Chandra Bose (President)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Quit India Movement, a mass civil disobedience movement, was launched under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  The Individual Satyagraha, a form of limited civil disobedience, saw Vinoba Bhave as its first participant.  The Lahore Congress Session of 1929, a significant turning point, was presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru. Option 1 is incorrect because while Nehru was a key figure in the Indian independence movement, the Dandi March was specifically led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, revealing a potential lack of understanding of the specific roles of prominent figures in key events of the Indian independence movement.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Act                       Correct Description
1. All-India Federation                   :  Never fully implemented due to princely state opposition
2. Provincial Autonomy                    :  Replaced dyarchy with greater provincial self-governance
3. System of Communal Electorates       :  Further strengthened by the Act
4. Federal Legislature                     :  Comprised a unicameral system with only a lower house


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced an All-India Federation, but it was never fully implemented due to the reluctance of many princely states to join.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system and granting provinces greater self-governance. The Act also continued and strengthened the system of communal electorates, a feature that fueled communal divisions. Option 4 is incorrect because the federal legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935, was bicameral, consisting of both the Council of States (upper house) and the Federal Assembly (lower house). Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe features of the Act. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the implementation of the federation and the nature of the federal legislature, demonstrating a need for more thorough knowledge of the Act's provisions and their consequences.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                      Movement/Association
1. Subhas Chandra Bose                     :   Forward Bloc
2. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan                :   Khudai Khidmatgars (Red Shirts)
3. Rani Gaidinliu                           :   Manipuri participation in Civil Disobedience Movement
4.  Mahatma Gandhi                         :   All India Anti-Untouchability League


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc in 1939 as a faction within the Indian National Congress. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," led the Khudai Khidmatgars, a Pashtun non-violent movement in the North-West Frontier Province. Rani Gaidinliu, a Naga woman, led a significant rebellion against British rule in Manipur during the Civil Disobedience Movement. Mahatma Gandhi established the All India Anti-Untouchability League in 1932, demonstrating his commitment to social reform.  These figures and their associations represent key moments and actors in the Indian independence movement, showcasing diverse regional and ideological approaches to the struggle against colonial rule. The other options are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the leadership and organizational structures within the Indian independence movement.  A complete understanding of this period requires knowledge of these diverse figures and their contributions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                             Political Stance/Action
1.  Govind Ballabh Pant                       :  Moved resolution reaffirming faith in Gandhian policies at Tripuri Congress
2.  Acharya Narendra Dev                     :  Opposed Indian participation in World War II
3.  Jayaprakash Narayan                      :  Opposed Indian participation in World War II
4.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad                  :  Presided over Ramgarh Congress Session


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Govind Ballabh Pant played a crucial role in the Tripuri Congress session of 1939, moving a resolution that ultimately led to Subhas Chandra Bose's resignation. Acharya Narendra Dev and Jayaprakash Narayan, prominent socialist leaders, were both against India's involvement in World War II, believing it to be an imperialist conflict. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a significant figure in the Indian National Congress, presided over the Ramgarh Congress session in 1940, a crucial meeting that shaped the movement's strategy during World War II.  These individuals and their actions highlight the internal debates and diverse viewpoints within the Congress during a critical period of the Indian freedom struggle.  An accurate understanding requires familiarity with the key players and their positions on crucial political decisions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Congress’s internal debates during the period between the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Leader                          Position/Action
1.  Jawaharlal Nehru                        :   Advocated for a continuous direct action policy
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose                     :   Advocated for a continuous direct action policy
3.  M.A. Ansari                             :   Advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections
4.  Gandhi                                   :   Initially opposed office acceptance, later gave approval


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the positions and actions of these Congress leaders in the period after the Civil Disobedience Movement. Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, representing the leftist wing, strongly advocated for a continuous, non-constitutional struggle against British rule, rejecting the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy favoured by some.  M.A. Ansari, along with others, championed a more moderate approach, emphasizing constitutional means such as participating in elections and working within the existing political system.  Gandhi, initially hesitant about office acceptance, eventually sanctioned the formation of Congress ministries in provinces after the 1937 elections. These differing viewpoints highlight the ideological tensions and strategic debates within the Congress during this period, shaping the movement's trajectory.  Omitting any of these figures or misrepresenting their stances would present an incomplete and inaccurate picture of this crucial phase of the Indian freedom struggle. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                    Description
1.  All India Federation                       :   Never established due to non-fulfillment of conditions
2.  Provincial Autonomy                      :   Replaced dyarchy
3.  Federal Legislature                       :   Bicameral, with Council of States partly nominated by princes
4.  Special Responsibilities of Governor-General:   Included maintaining security and tranquillity of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the four pairs accurately describes a feature of the Government of India Act, 1935. The proposed All-India Federation, a key element of the Act, never materialized due to the failure of princely states to meet the stipulated conditions for joining. Provincial autonomy replaced the earlier dyarchy system, granting provinces greater self-governance. The federal legislature was bicameral, with the Council of States having a significant portion of its members nominated by the rulers of princely states, reflecting the continued influence of these entities in the political landscape. The Governor-General retained special responsibilities, including the crucial power to maintain the security and tranquillity of India, underscoring the limitations on the transfer of power. Understanding these features is essential for comprehending the complexities and limitations of the Act and its impact on the Indian political scene. The other options are incorrect because they fail to account for all correctly matched pairs, indicating a lack of complete and accurate understanding of the Act's provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Policy                                   Impact/Consequence
1.  Rowlatt Act                                  :   Led to widespread protests and the formation of Satyagraha Sabha
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                   :   Triggered a wave of national outrage and intensified the demand for independence
3.  Treaty of Sevres                             :   Incensed Indian Muslims due to its harsh terms for Turkey
4.  Chauri Chaura Incident                     :   Prompted Gandhi to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately depict the causal relationships between significant events and their consequences during the Indian independence movement. The Rowlatt Act, a repressive piece of legislation, sparked widespread protests and led to the establishment of the Satyagraha Sabha, marking a shift in the methods of the nationalist movement. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a brutal act of violence, further galvanized the demand for independence, intensifying anti-British sentiment. The Treaty of Sevres, which imposed harsh terms on Turkey, angered Indian Muslims, who saw the Ottoman Sultan as their Caliph, and this contributed to the Khilafat Movement. The Chauri Chaura incident, an act of violence by protestors, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, highlighting the challenges of maintaining non-violence during mass mobilization.  Understanding these interconnections is crucial for grasping the dynamics of the Indian freedom struggle. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they understate the accurate connections between the given pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                          Person Associated
1.  Signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact            :   Tej Bahadur Sapru
2.  Quit India Movement                       :   Clement Attlee
3.  Negotiations with Cripps Mission & Lord Wavell :   Abul Kalam Azad
4.  Halting of the Non-Cooperation Movement  :   Chauri-Chaura incident
5.  Second Round Table Conference             :   Irwin-Gandhi Pact


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Abul Kalam Azad was the Congress President who negotiated with both the Cripps Mission and Lord Wavell. The Chauri-Chaura incident, involving violence against the police, led Mahatma Gandhi to halt the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Option (a) is incorrect because Tej Bahadur Sapru was not directly involved in the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; although he was a prominent figure in Indian politics at the time, other individuals played a more central role in the negotiations.

Option (b) is incorrect because Clement Attlee was the Prime Minister of England *after* the Quit India Movement.  The Prime Minister during the Quit India Movement was Winston Churchill.

Option (d) is incorrect because while the Chauri-Chaura incident is correctly linked to the halting of the Non-Cooperation Movement, the other pairs are incorrectly matched.

The question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to accurately associate individuals with specific historical events.  The distractors are carefully chosen to include names and events closely related to the correct answers, testing the candidate's precise knowledge and ability to differentiate between similar historical contexts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                            Key Feature/Outcome
1.  Moplah Rebellion of 1921                 :   Offshoot of the Swadeshi Movement
2.  Azad Hind Fauz establishment in 1943      :   Based in Malaya
3.  First Round Table Conference               :   Attended by Mahatma Gandhi
4.  Cripps' Proposal                          :   Viewed as a post-dated cheque by Jawaharlal Nehru
5.  Congress Working Committee Meeting (July 6, 1942):   Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  The Cripps' proposal was indeed viewed as a "post-dated cheque on a crashing bank" by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru as stated in option 4.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was the President of the Congress Working Committee at the meeting on July 6, 1942, where Gandhi first discussed his Quit India policy.

The other options are incorrect due to factual inaccuracies. The Moplah Rebellion was linked to the Khilafat Movement, not the Swadeshi Movement. The Azad Hind Fauz was established in Singapore, not Malaya. Mahatma Gandhi did not attend the First Round Table Conference. These incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Indian independence movement.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between nuanced historical details.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                    Significant Action/Stance
1.  Subhash Chandra Bose                 :   Secured a majority for a Guerrilla War plan at the Allahabad Congress Working Committee meeting in 1947
2.  Mahatma Gandhi                          :   First discussed the "Quit India Policy" at the Wardha Working Committee meeting
3.  Vinoba Bhave                            :   Primarily used the word 'Sarvodaya'
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                         :   Attended the First Round Table Conference in London.
5.  Motilal Nehru                           :   Played a significant role in the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Only pair 3 is accurately matched. Vinoba Bhave is correctly identified as the primary user of the term "Sarvodaya."

The other options are incorrect due to several reasons.  Subhash Chandra Bose did not secure a majority for a guerrilla war plan at the Allahabad Congress Working Committee meeting in 1947; this is a factual inaccuracy.  Mahatma Gandhi first discussed the "Quit India Policy" at the Wardha Working Committee meeting in July 1942, not at an earlier meeting.  Motilal Nehru did not play a significant role in the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; while he was a prominent Congress leader, others were more directly involved in the negotiations. Jawaharlal Nehru did not attend the First Round Table Conference. This question tests factual recall of key figures and their actions within the Indian independence movement, demanding precise knowledge to avoid the plausible distractors.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                      Association/Event
1.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha                   :   Abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey
2.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel               :   Led the Akali Movement in Punjab
3.  C. Rajagopalachari                     :   Authored the Nehru Report
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                       :   Presided over the Lahore Congress Session of 1929
5.  Bhagat Singh and associates            :   Death sentences commuted by the Gandhi-Irwin Pact



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Mustafa Kemal Pasha is correctly linked to the abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey. Jawaharlal Nehru correctly presided over the Lahore Congress session in 1929.

The other options contain inaccuracies. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not lead the Akali Movement; the Akali movement was a Sikh movement for reform within Gurudwaras. C. Rajagopalachari was not the author of the Nehru Report; Motilal Nehru headed the committee that drafted it. The death sentences of Bhagat Singh and his associates were *not* commuted by the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; this is a significant point of divergence, making it a strong distractor.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall key events and figures within the broader context of the Indian National Movement and its international connections.


**5. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress President                      Year of Presidency
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                       :   1893
2.  Badruddin Tyabji                       :   1887
3.  Pherozeshah Mehta                      :   1890
4.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                  :   1905


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only option (d) is correct. Badruddin Tyabji served as the Congress President in 1887.  The other pairings are incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's presidency was in 1886, not 1893.  Pherozeshah Mehta's presidency was in 1890, but he did not hold the position. Gopal Krishna Gokhale did not serve as Congress President in 1905;  he held other significant positions within the Congress. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of early Congress leadership, requiring precise recall of years and figures to navigate the distractors effectively.  This question assesses factual recall of historical data specific to the Indian National Congress.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                    Associated Movement/Party
1. C.R. Das                                  :   No-Changers
2. Motilal Nehru                             :   Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party
3. Vallabhbhai Patel                         :   Swarajist Party
4. C. Rajagopalachari                        :   No-Changers
5. M.A. Ansari                               :   No-Changers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru, and Ajmal Khan were key figures in the Swarajist movement, advocating for participation in legislative councils.  Vallabhbhai Patel, along with Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Ansari, were prominent members of the No-Changers faction, opposing council entry and focusing on constructive work.  Therefore, pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because C.R. Das was a Swarajist, not a No-Changer. Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of M.A. Ansari with the No-Changers. Option (d) incorrectly pairs Vallabhbhai Patel with the Swarajist party, and incorrectly includes the pairing of C.R. Das with No-Changers.  Understanding the ideological divisions within the Indian National Congress during the post-Non-Cooperation phase is crucial for comprehending the evolution of the nationalist movement. The Swarajists and No-Changers represent distinct approaches to achieving self-rule, reflecting differing perspectives on the role of legislative participation and mass movements.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                   Role/Association
1. M.N. Roy                     :   First Indian member of Communist International
2. Muzaffar Ahmad               :   Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case
3. S.A. Dange                   :   Meerut Conspiracy Case
4. Jawaharlal Nehru              :   President, All Bengal Students' Conference
5. Subhash Chandra Bose        :   Founder, Forward Bloc


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

M.N. Roy was indeed the first Indian elected to the leadership of the Communist International.  Muzaffar Ahmed was involved in the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case. S.A. Dange was a key figure in the Meerut Conspiracy Case. Jawaharlal Nehru presided over the All Bengal Students' Conference in 1928.  Subhash Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc. All the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correct pairing. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures in the early communist movement in India and their involvement in significant events.  It also highlights the intersection of socialist and nationalist ideologies within the Indian freedom struggle. The rise of communist and socialist ideas during this period significantly shaped the political landscape and the strategies employed by various nationalist groups.


**3. With reference to the post-Non-Cooperation Movement period in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Group            Characteristic/Action
1. Swarajists                  :   Advocated constructive work
2. No-Changers                :   Opposed council entry
3. Congress Socialist Party     :   Advocated Purna Swaraj
4. Hindustan Republican Association :   Kakori Conspiracy Case
5. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association :   Saunders' assassination


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The No-Changers, indeed, opposed entry into legislative councils. The Hindustan Republican Association was involved in the Kakori train robbery. The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association was responsible for the assassination of John Saunders. The Swarajists, however, advocated council entry, not constructive work (that was the No-Changers' focus). While the Congress Socialist Party did emerge later and advocated for complete independence ('Purna Swaraj'), that wasn't their primary defining characteristic in this specific period. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, reflecting potential misconceptions about the differing strategies and ideologies within the Indian nationalist movement.  This question assesses understanding of the diverse approaches within the nationalist movement, highlighting the complexities of the struggle for independence.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Act                      Year
1. Gandhi-Irwin Pact               :   1932
2. Second Round Table Conference  :   1931
3. Communal Award                :   1930
4. Poona Pact                       :   1932
5. Government of India Act, 1935 :   1935


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Second Round Table Conference was held in 1931. The Poona Pact was signed in 1932. The Government of India Act, 1935, was enacted in 1935.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in 1931, not 1932. The Communal Award was announced in 1932, not 1930.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question tests the candidate's chronological understanding of key events and constitutional developments during the period leading up to Indian independence.  Accurate temporal placement of these events is vital for a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the Indian National Congress and its interactions with the British government.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                  Position/Role
1.  Vithalbhai Patel                         :   Speaker, Central Legislative Assembly
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose                     :   President, Indian National Congress (Tripuri Session)
3.  Jawaharlal Nehru                         :   President, Indian National Congress (Lahore Session)
4.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad                 :   President, Indian National Congress (Ramgarh Session)
5.  Rajendra Prasad                          :  President, Indian National Congress (Haripura Session)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vithalbhai Patel served as the Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly. Subhas Chandra Bose presided over the Tripuri session of the Indian National Congress. Jawaharlal Nehru presided over the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress where 'Purna Swaraj' was declared. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad presided over the Ramgarh session of the Congress.  However, Rajendra Prasad presided over the Haripura session, not Subhas Chandra Bose. Therefore, options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) either include incorrect pairings or omit correct ones. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key leaders of the Indian National Congress and their roles at significant Congress sessions during different phases of the independence movement.  Understanding the leadership transitions and the ideological shifts reflected in the selection of Congress presidents is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the movement's trajectory.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan.  The questions are designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Person                      Associated with
1. Treaty of Sevres                   :   Complete dismemberment of Turkey
2.  Hunter Committee                 :   Inquiry into Jallianwala Bagh massacre
3.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah              :   Advocated militant nationalism during Khilafat Movement
4.  C.R. Das                         :   Initially opposed boycott of legislative councils in Non-Cooperation Movement
5.  Acharya Narendra Dev            :   Leadership of National Colleges during Non-Cooperation Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Treaty of Sevres (1920) indeed led to the severe dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, significantly impacting the Khilafat issue. The Hunter Committee was established to investigate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, though its findings were widely criticized as a whitewash.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while initially a proponent of constitutional methods, later became associated with the more radical nationalist elements within the Muslim League during the Khilafat movement.  C.R. Das initially expressed reservations about the boycott of legislative councils within the Non-Cooperation Movement, though he ultimately adhered to Congress discipline.  Acharya Narendra Dev played a significant role in the establishment and leadership of several national educational institutions during the Non-Cooperation Movement. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Organization                 Role/Action
1.  All India Khilafat Committee      :   Initially focused on petitions and deputations
2.  Gandhi                            :   President of the All India Khilafat Committee
3.  Tilak                              :   Opposed alliance with Muslim leaders on a religious issue
4.  Nagpur Congress Session (1920)   :   Congress goal changed to attainment of Swaraj through peaceful and legitimate means
5.  Jamia Millia Islamia               :   A national college established during the movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The All India Khilafat Committee initially employed moderate methods like petitions and deputations before escalating to a more militant phase of non-cooperation. Gandhi's leadership of the All India Khilafat Committee was crucial in bridging the Hindu-Muslim divide and mobilizing mass support. Tilak’s skepticism towards an alliance based on religious grounds and his reservations about Satyagraha as a political tool are well-documented. The Nagpur session of the Congress (1920) marked a significant shift in the Congress's objective, formally adopting the goal of Swaraj through peaceful and legitimate means.  Jamia Millia Islamia is one of the prominent national educational institutions established during the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of the Non-Cooperation Movement   Description
1. Economic Hardship Post-WWI         :   Rise in commodity prices, decreased industrial production, increased taxes
2. Rowlatt Act                            :   Allowed detention without trial
3. Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms           :   Completely satisfied Indian demands for self-government
4. Khilafat Issue                         :   Concerned the treatment of Turkey after WWI
5.  Lucknow Pact (1916)                 :   Stimulated Hindu-Muslim cooperation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The post-World War I economic situation in India was characterized by inflation, decline in industrial output, and increased tax burdens, fueling public discontent. The Rowlatt Act, infamous for its provisions allowing detention without trial, further aggravated the situation. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing limited self-government (dyarchy), fell short of fully meeting Indian aspirations for complete independence. The Khilafat issue, stemming from the post-WWI treatment of Turkey, played a crucial role in galvanizing Hindu-Muslim unity. The Lucknow Pact of 1916 fostered cooperation between the Congress and the Muslim League, laying the groundwork for joint political action. Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms completely satisfied Indian demands. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect statement about the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect statement about the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms.


**4. With reference to the aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                     Action/Stance
1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah                :   Continued to advocate for constitutional and lawful struggle
2.  Annie Besant                         :   Left the Congress due to differences over methods of struggle
3.  C.R. Das                            :   Founded the Indian National Liberal Federation
4.  Revolutionary Terrorists in Bengal :   Pledged support to the Congress programme
5.  Surendranath Banerjea              :   Founded the Indian National Liberal Federation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Following the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while remaining within the political discourse, continued to advocate for constitutional methods. Annie Besant, a prominent figure in Indian nationalism, parted ways with the Congress due to disagreements over the methods of struggle. C.R. Das did not found the Indian National Liberal Federation; Surendranath Banerjea did.  Many revolutionary terrorist groups, particularly those active in Bengal, expressed solidarity with and pledged support to the Congress's programme even after the movement's suspension. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                     Perspective on the Non-Cooperation Movement
1.  Gandhi                                   :   Advocated for complete withdrawal due to violence at Chauri Chaura
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose                     :   Criticized the withdrawal as a “national calamity”
3.  Motilal Nehru                           :   Shared popular resentment over the movement's abrupt end
4.  Lala Lajpat Rai                         :   Advocated for immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience
5.  Marxist Interpretation                   :   Viewed the movement as a controlled affair by Congress leadership

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gandhi's decision to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement after the Chauri Chaura incident is well-documented.  Subhas Chandra Bose, among other prominent leaders, strongly criticized this decision, viewing it as detrimental to the national cause. Motilal Nehru, imprisoned at the time, shared the widespread dissatisfaction with the sudden halt of the movement. While Lala Lajpat Rai likely shared the sentiment that the movement should have continued, explicitly advocating for immediate resumption is not definitively established from the text. The Marxist interpretation of the movement highlights the Congress leadership's role in controlling the mass upsurge, preventing it from becoming fully revolutionary. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) omits the Marxist interpretation. Option (c) incorrectly attributes an explicit call for immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience to Lala Lajpat Rai. Option (d) incorrectly attributes an explicit call for immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience to Lala Lajpat Rai.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Quit India Movement, the demand for Pakistan, the INA, and related political developments.  The questions are designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, with plausible distractors included to test the candidate's understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Organization            Role/Activity during the Quit India Movement
1. Aruna Asaf Ali                     :   Led underground radio broadcasts in Bombay
2. Usha Mehta                         :   Presided over a Congress committee session
3. Jayaprakash Narayan                :   Organized parallel governments in several regions
4.  Ram Manohar Lohia                 :   Participated in subversive activities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aruna Asaf Ali's crucial role in the Quit India Movement included presiding over a Congress session after the arrest of top leaders and actively participating in underground activities.  Usha Mehta indeed started an underground radio in Bombay to counter British censorship and maintain morale.  Jayaprakash Narayan was involved in underground activities and the organization of parallel governments, particularly in Bihar. Ram Manohar Lohia also actively engaged in subversive activities during the movement. Option (a) is incorrect because while Aruna Asaf Ali was involved in underground activities, she did not lead the underground radio broadcasts; that was Usha Mehta. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia's significant contributions. Option (d) is incorrect because while Jayaprakash Narayan organized parallel governments, he did not do so in 'several regions' as stated.  The extent of his involvement was concentrated in specific areas.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to differentiate between the various roles played by different individuals during the movement.


**2. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Reason for Launching the Movement       Description
1. Failure of the Cripps Mission           :   Exposed Britain’s unwillingness to grant complete independence
2. Popular Discontent                    :   Primarily due to the economic hardships faced by the masses
3. Imminent British Collapse              :   Increased popular willingness to express discontent against the British
4. Japanese Advance                      :   The Japanese advance towards India's borders heightened the need for a unified movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Quit India Movement was triggered by a confluence of factors. The failure of the Cripps Mission, which offered dominion status instead of complete independence, fueled frustration and disillusionment among Indian nationalists. Widespread popular discontent stemmed from the severe economic hardships caused by World War II—rising prices, shortages, and wartime measures.  The perception of an imminent British collapse in the face of the Japanese advance in Southeast Asia further emboldened the Indian populace to actively challenge British rule. The Japanese threat to India's borders directly contributed to the urgency of the movement.  All the pairs are correctly matched, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the historical context. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one crucial factor that contributed to the launch of the movement. This question tests factual recall and the ability to understand the complex interplay of factors that led to a major historical event.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                  Stance towards the Quit India Movement
1. The Communist Party of India     :   Supported the movement actively
2. The Muslim League                 :   Opposed the movement
3. The Hindu Mahasabha               :   Remained largely neutral


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Muslim League actively opposed the Quit India Movement, fearing that the British withdrawal would leave the Muslim minority vulnerable to Hindu majority rule. This stance reflects the League's growing focus on the demand for Pakistan.  The Communist Party of India did not actively support the movement; their position shifted towards supporting the British war effort against Nazi Germany. The Hindu Mahasabha also did not support the Quit India Movement, viewing it as a predominantly Hindu movement and not aligning with its goals.  Option (b) correctly identifies the Muslim League's opposition, a significant aspect of the movement's context.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to misrepresentation of the stances adopted by the Communist Party of India and the Hindu Mahasabha.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the diverse political landscape during the Quit India Movement.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Role in the INA
1. Subhas Chandra Bose                      :   Supreme Commander
2. Rash Behari Bose                          :   Initially formed the INA
3. Mohan Singh                             :   Transformed the INA into a significant force


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose became the Supreme Commander of the INA after taking over from Rash Behari Bose. While Rash Behari Bose played a key role in establishing the Indian Independence League in Japan, which provided the organizational framework for the INA, he did not initially form the INA itself.  Mohan Singh initially formed the INA from Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia; Subhas Chandra Bose’s arrival and leadership significantly expanded its size and impact, transforming it into a more substantial fighting force.  Option (a) correctly identifies the roles of Subhas Chandra Bose and Mohan Singh. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the roles played by Rash Behari Bose and Mohan Singh in the formation and development of the INA.  The question assesses factual knowledge and understanding of the INA's organizational structure and leadership.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Plan/Proposal                           Key Feature
1. Cripps Mission                           :   Offered dominion status with the right to secede for provinces
2. Wavell Plan                             :   Proposed an all-Indian executive council with equal representation for Hindus and Muslims
3. Rajagopalachari Formula                 :   Tacitly accepted the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Cripps Mission offered dominion status to India, along with the controversial provision allowing provinces to opt out of the Indian Union, paving the way for the partition of India. The Wavell Plan aimed to create an executive council comprising Indians, with equal representation for Hindus and Muslims, though the Governor-General retained significant powers.  The Rajagopalachari Formula, proposed by C. Rajagopalachari, attempted to resolve the Hindu-Muslim conflict by implicitly accepting the League's demand for Pakistan, contingent on certain conditions.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of their respective proposals. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual recall and understanding of significant constitutional proposals during the period leading up to Indian independence.  It requires the candidate to recall the core features of each proposal and to distinguish between them.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                 Ideological Stance/Approach
1. Mahatma Gandhi                         :   Advocated for complete independence through non-violent methods
2. Subhas Chandra Bose                    :   Believed in a more militant approach to achieving independence
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                        :   Supported socialism as the ideal economic model for India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy centered on achieving complete independence through non-violent means (Satyagraha).  Subhas Chandra Bose advocated a more militant and assertive approach to securing independence, even collaborating with Axis powers during World War II. Jawaharlal Nehru was a strong proponent of socialism and envisioned a socialist India after independence. All three pairs accurately reflect the ideological leanings of these leaders. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the diverse ideological currents within the Indian nationalist movement.  It requires the candidate to differentiate between the distinct approaches of these key figures.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                     Association/Movement
1. Dadabhai Naoroji           :   President of the Indian National Congress (multiple times)
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale     :   Founder of the Servants of India Society
3. Surendranath Banerjea    :   Prominent leader of the Indian National Conference
4. Bal Gangadhar Tilak       :   Leader of the Home Rule Movement
5. Mahadev Govind Ranade   :   Prominent member of the Indian National Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji served as President of the Indian National Congress on three separate occasions, making him a prominent figure in the early years of the Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale founded the Servants of India Society, a reformist organization dedicated to social and political reform. Surendranath Banerjea was instrumental in the formation of the Indian National Conference, a precursor to the Indian National Congress. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a significant leader of the Home Rule Movement, which advocated for greater Indian self-governance within the British Empire. Mahadev Govind Ranade was a key member of the Indian National Congress and a respected social reformer.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these accurately matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of key figures and their roles in the Indian National Movement, highlighting the diverse leadership that shaped the movement's early stages.  The inclusion of lesser-known facts, such as Ranade's role, adds to the difficulty of the question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure         Significant Contribution/Association
1. A. O. Hume               :   President of the First Indian National Congress session
2. Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee :   Architect of the Indian National Conference
3. Lord Dufferin             :   Did not obstruct the formation of the Indian National Congress
4. Lord Curzon              :   Expressed desire to assist the Congress to a peaceful demise
5. Dadabhai Naoroji         :   Authored the book "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect historical facts. Lord Dufferin, the Viceroy of India at the time, did not actively obstruct the formation of the Indian National Congress, despite some suggestions that he was initially skeptical.  Lord Curzon, later Viceroy, famously expressed a desire to see the Congress peacefully dissolve. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist, is indeed the author of the influential work "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India."  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the roles of A. O. Hume and Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee.  A. O. Hume was instrumental in the formation of the Congress but did not preside over its first session. Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee did preside over the first session. The question tests knowledge of key individuals and their actions related to the early Indian National Congress, demanding a nuanced understanding of the context and motivations behind their actions. The inclusion of Lord Curzon's statement adds a layer of difficulty, requiring recall of a less frequently mentioned detail.



**3.  With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Demand                                      Characteristic
1. Expansion and reform of Legislative Councils :   Immediate and moderate demand
2. Swarajya (self-government)                 :   Advanced demand put forward in the early 20th century
3. Indianisation of higher administrative services :   Demand raised on economic, political, and moral grounds
4. No taxation without representation           :  A slogan adopted from the American War of Independence
5. Rapid development of modern industries       :  Suggested remedy for India's poverty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The early nationalists' immediate demands for constitutional reform focused on expanding and reforming the Legislative Councils, a moderate approach aimed at gradual change.  The demand for Swarajya (self-government) emerged later, in the early 20th century, representing a more advanced stage of nationalist aspirations. The call for Indianisation of higher administrative services was based on economic, political, and moral arguments, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the demand.  The slogan "No taxation without representation" was indeed adopted from the American War of Independence, demonstrating the early nationalists' engagement with global political thought. Finally, the rapid development of modern industries was proposed as a key solution to India's economic problems, showcasing the nationalists' economic vision. The question assesses the student's understanding of the early nationalists' demands and their strategic approach to achieving self-governance.  It requires them to differentiate between immediate and advanced demands, while also understanding the rationale behind those demands.


**4. With reference to the early Indian nationalists and their economic views, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                      Economic Policy/View
1. Dadabhai Naoroji           :   Advocated for tariff protection for Indian industries
2. R.C. Dutt                   :   Formulated the "Drain Theory" of British exploitation
3. Dinshaw Wacha              :   Promoted the idea of Swadeshi (use of Indian goods)
4. Gopal Krishna Gokhale      :   Championed the cause of agrarian reform
5. Bal Gangadhar Tilak        :  Opposed the introduction of modern industries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude or include incorrectly matched pairs.  While Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, and Dinshaw Wacha were all significant figures in the early nationalist movement and advocated for economic reforms, the statement that Bal Gangadhar Tilak opposed the introduction of modern industries is not entirely accurate.  While Tilak emphasized Swadeshi and traditional industries, he didn't necessarily oppose modern industrial development outright.  He focused more on the need to protect and revive traditional Indian industries from British competition.  The correct option (b) includes all four correctly matched pairs: Dadabhai Naoroji's advocacy for tariff protection, R.C. Dutt's formulation of the Drain Theory, Dinshaw Wacha's promotion of Swadeshi, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale's focus on agrarian reform.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the economic perspectives of key early nationalist leaders and necessitates an understanding of their nuanced positions on industrialization and economic development.  The inclusion of Tilak as a distractor adds to the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session          Key Decision/Event
1. Calcutta Session (1928)   :   Gandhi-Irwin Pact signed
2. Lahore Session (1929)     :   Purna Swaraj declared as the Congress goal
3. Karachi Session (1931)    :   Resolution on Fundamental Rights and National Economic Programme adopted
4. Haripura Session (1938)  :   Subhas Chandra Bose elected Congress President
5. Tripuri Session (1939)    :   Gandhi's resignation from the Congress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931, not at the Calcutta Session of 1928.  Gandhi's resignation from the Congress occurred after the Tripuri Session in 1939 due to disagreements with Subhas Chandra Bose, but it wasn't a decision *taken* at that session itself.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. Option (a) correctly identifies the matches for sessions 2, 3, and 4:  The Lahore Session (1929) did indeed declare Purna Swaraj as the Congress goal. The Karachi Session (1931) adopted crucial resolutions on Fundamental Rights and the National Economic Programme. The Haripura Session (1938) saw Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of key Congress sessions and their historical significance. The inclusion of incorrect dates and events as distractors, and the close relationship between the correct and incorrect options makes this a difficult question.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the period of militant nationalism in India (1905-1918) and related political figures and events.  Note that the difficulty level is intended to be high, reflecting the complexity of the historical context and requiring nuanced understanding.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Detained/Imprisoned      Reason for Detention/Imprisonment
1. Lala Lajpat Rai                  : Riots in Punjab canal colonies
2. Krishna Kumar Mitra             :  Association with Anti-Partition Agitation
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak             :  Sedition related to anti-partition activities
4. Chidambaram Pillai              :  Involvement in Madras nationalist activities
5. Ajit Singh                       :  Association with Anti-Partition Agitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907.  Krishna Kumar Mitra's involvement in the anti-partition agitation led to his deportation. Bal Gangadhar Tilak's active role in the anti-partition movement and his nationalist writings resulted in his imprisonment on sedition charges.  Chidambaram Pillai's participation in Madras nationalist activities led to his imprisonment. The question uses several plausible distractors by including individuals associated with the broader nationalist movement and subtly altering the reasons for their detention to test the examinee's precise knowledge.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper/Publication             Prominent Ideological Stance
1. *Yugantar*                        : Advocated revolutionary terrorism
2. *Sandhya*                         : Promoted passive resistance
3. *Kal*                              : Supported constitutional methods
4. *India* (British Committee Journal) :  Advocated for Indian welfare in Britain
5.  *The Morning Post*               : Supported General Dyer's actions in Jallianwala Bagh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

*Yugantar* and other publications like *Sandhya* actively promoted revolutionary terrorism as a means to achieve independence.  *Kal* was another important publication that played a role in the nationalist movement, though the prompt subtly alters its stance to test understanding of the specific publications. *India*, published by the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, aimed to influence British public opinion in favor of Indian welfare.  The inclusion of *The Morning Post* acts as a significant distractor, highlighting the international dimension of the events surrounding the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The correct option highlights the examinee's ability to distinguish between different strands of the nationalist movement and their respective media outlets.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure       Key Political Stance/Action
1. Aurobindo Ghosh      : Openly declared "Political Freedom is the lifebreath of a nation."
2. Bipin Chandra Pal    : Primarily advocated for constitutional methods
3. Gokhale                :  Advocated for self-government within the British Empire
4. Dadabhai Naoroji     :  Emphasized economic exploitation as a root cause of India's poverty
5.  Mustafa Kamal Pasha :  Abolished the Caliphate in Turkey


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghosh's famous declaration regarding political freedom is accurately reflected in the pair. Gokhale's advocacy for self-government within the British Empire is a well-known fact.  Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work on the economic drain theory is accurately presented. Mustafa Kamal Pasha's abolition of the Caliphate is historically accurate.  The inclusion of Bipin Chandra Pal with a subtly altered political stance is a key distractor designed to challenge the examinee's understanding of the nuances within the nationalist movement. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of key figures and their specific contributions to the nationalist discourse.


**4. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Legislation              Associated Outcome
1. Partition of Bengal (1905)      :  Rise of the Swadeshi movement
2. Morley-Minto Reforms (1909)   : Introduction of separate electorates
3. Surat Split (1907)             :  Increased unity within the Congress
4.  Indian Councils Act of 1892    :  Significant expansion of Indian representation in councils
5.  The Treaty of Sevres (1920)    :  Strengthened the Khilafat movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The partition of Bengal directly triggered the Swadeshi movement as a form of mass protest. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced the detrimental policy of separate electorates for Muslims. The Treaty of Sevres, unfavorable to Turkey, intensified the Khilafat movement. The Surat split, however, weakened the Congress, not strengthening it, and the 1892 Indian Councils Act only offered limited expansion of Indian representation. The question uses subtle alterations to established facts to test the applicant's thorough understanding of these landmark events and their impact. The correct answer requires precise knowledge of the consequences of each event.


**1. With reference to the early years of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following pairs:**

    Person                      Action/Association

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and sentenced to six years' imprisonment in 1908. Aurobindo Ghose was a prominent figure in the militant nationalist movement, advocating for passive resistance and boycotts. Shyamji Krishnavarma led revolutionary activities from London.  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were involved in the Muzzaffarpur bomb incident in 1908.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs. Option (a) incorrectly limits the correct matches to only one pair. Option (b) omits two correctly matched pairs. Option (d) omits three correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of option (c) accurately reflects the historical events and individuals' roles during this period of the Indian nationalist movement.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of key figures and events in the early 20th-century Indian struggle for independence.


**2. With reference to the Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following pairs:**

    Newspaper/Publication       Ideology/Focus
1. Yugantar                     :  Advocated revolutionary terrorism
2. Sandhya                      :  Promoted revolutionary terrorism in Bengal
3. Kal                           :  Promoted revolutionary terrorism in Maharashtra
4. India                         :  Propaganda for Indian interests in Britain
5. Pukhtoon                      :  Political publication of the Khudai Khidmatgars


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  *Yugantar* and *Sandhya* were newspapers in Bengal that advocated for revolutionary terrorism. *Kal* was a Marathi newspaper that promoted similar ideas in Maharashtra. *India* was a journal published by the British Committee of the Indian National Congress to advocate for Indian interests in Britain. *Pukhtoon* was a Pushto-language political monthly published by the Khudai Khidmatgars in the North-West Frontier Province.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall regarding publications associated with different facets of the nationalist movement, ranging from constitutionalist to revolutionary approaches.  It also assesses understanding of the geographical spread of these ideologies and the use of media for political mobilization.


**3. With reference to the post-Non-Cooperation Movement period (1920s-1930s), consider the following pairs:**

    Political Group/Leader         Stance on Council Entry
1. C.R. Das                       :  Opposed council entry
2. Motilal Nehru                   :  Advocated for council entry
3.  Vallabhbhai Patel              :  Opposed council entry
4.  C. Rajagopalachari             :  Advocated for council entry
5.  Ajmal Khan                     :  Advocated for council entry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, along with Ajmal Khan, were leaders of the Swarajist party, which advocated entering legislative councils to obstruct the government and raise public awareness. Vallabhbhai Patel and C. Rajagopalachari were among the "No-changers" who opposed council entry. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair of Motilal Nehru. Option (d) also excludes the correctly matched pair of Vallabhbhai Patel. The question assesses the understanding of the different factions within the Congress during a crucial transitional phase of the nationalist movement. It evaluates the ability to differentiate between the Swarajists and the No-changers based on their stances on participating in legislative councils.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary movements in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following pairs:**

    Revolutionary Group/Leader     Significant Action/Event
1. Hindustan Republican Association : Kakori Conspiracy
2. Bhagat Singh                   :  Assassination of John Saunders
3. Surya Sen                      :  Chittagong Armoury Raid
4.  Chandrashekhar Azad           :  Led the HSRA after the Kakori incident
5.  Ramprasad Bismil              :  Involved in the Kakori Conspiracy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was responsible for the Kakori train robbery. Bhagat Singh was involved in the assassination of John Saunders. Surya Sen led the Chittagong Armoury Raid. Chandrashekhar Azad played a key role in leading the HSRA after the Kakori incident.  Ramprasad Bismil was a key figure in the HRA and participated in the Kakori Conspiracy.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs. The question tests factual knowledge of revolutionary groups, their leaders, and their activities. It assesses the ability to connect specific events with the involved individuals and organizations, demonstrating an understanding of the revolutionary movement's different aspects.


**5. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Congress Leader/Group            Position on Office Acceptance (1937 Elections)
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                  :  Supported office acceptance
2. Subhas Chandra Bose              :  Opposed office acceptance
3. Congress Socialists                :  Opposed office acceptance
4.  Gandhi                           :  Initially opposed, later supported
5.  Right Wing of Congress           :  Supported office acceptance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Nehru, Bose, and the Congress Socialists initially opposed office acceptance in the 1937 elections, believing it would compromise the nationalist struggle. Gandhi initially opposed it but later gave his approval, seeing it as a strategic tool.  The right wing of the Congress supported office acceptance. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) incorrectly states that Gandhi supported office acceptance from the beginning. Option (d) omits the correctly matched pairs of Congress Socialists and the right-wing of the Congress. The question assesses understanding of the internal debates within the Congress on the strategy to adopt following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  It tests the ability to analyze the positions of different leaders and groups regarding office acceptance in the context of the 1935 Act and the 1937 provincial elections.  The question requires understanding of the complex political dynamics within the Congress.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Detained/Imprisoned                     Reason for Detention/Imprisonment
1. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh                 Riots in the canal colonies of the Punjab
2. Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt    Participation in anti-partition agitation
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                           Anti-partition agitation and related activities

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported following riots in the Punjab's canal colonies in 1907.  Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908 for their roles in the anti-partition movement.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak faced repeated arrests and imprisonment for his involvement in the anti-partition movement and other nationalist activities, including a six-year sentence in 1908. Chidambaram Pillai and Harisarvottam Rao were also imprisoned for their participation in nationalist movements in Madras and Andhra respectively.  Therefore, all five pairs represent accurate pairings of individuals with the reasons for their detention or imprisonment. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Group                    Prominent Leader(s)
1.  Militant Nationalism                       Bipin Chandra Pal
2.  Moderate Nationalism                      Gopal Krishna Gokhale

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Bipin Chandra Pal was a prominent leader of the militant nationalist faction within the Indian National Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale represented the moderate nationalist viewpoint. Khudiram Bose was a key figure in the revolutionary terrorism movement. Annie Besant played a significant role in the Home Rule League movement. Lala Hardayal was a prominent figure in the Ghadar movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of prominent leaders associated with various strands of the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  A comprehensive understanding of the diverse approaches to the freedom struggle is necessary to answer this question correctly.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Event/Act                            Year
1. Partition of Bengal                             1905
2.  Formation of the Indian National Congress    1885
3.  Passage of the Rowlatt Act                    1919
4.  Launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement     1920
5.  The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                 1919


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The partition of Bengal took effect in 1905, the Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, the Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched in 1920, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in 1919. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of significant events in Indian history and their chronological order.  Accurate knowledge of these dates is crucial for a complete understanding of the timeline of the Indian freedom struggle.


**4. With reference to early 20th-century Indian nationalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Publication                                   Editor/Prominent Contributor
1.  "Yugantar"                                  Aurobindo Ghose
2.  "Sandhya"                                   Unknown
3.  "Kesari"                                     Bal Gangadhar Tilak
4.  "Amrita Bazar Patrika"                      Unknown
5.  "India"                                      Dadabhai Naoroji


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the information about the editors of "Sandhya" and "Amrita Bazar Patrika" is not explicitly available, the text does confirm Aurobindo Ghose's association with "Yugantar," Bal Gangadhar Tilak's editorship of "Kesari," and Dadabhai Naoroji's connection with the journal "India."  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude some of the correct pairs or incorrectly suggest that only one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant nationalist publications and their key figures. The inclusion of unknown editors adds a layer of difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                            Associated Movement/Activity
1.  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi               Non-Cooperation Movement
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose                     Forward Bloc
3.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                 Bardoli Satyagraha
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru                          Quit India Movement
5.  C. Rajagopalachari                       No-changers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs represent accurate connections between political figures and their associated movements or activities. Mahatma Gandhi led the Non-Cooperation Movement. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was instrumental in the Bardoli Satyagraha. Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent leader of the Quit India Movement. C. Rajagopalachari was a prominent figure among the No-changers. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key figures and events in the Indian freedom struggle, testing their ability to associate individuals with specific movements.  The breadth of coverage makes this a challenging question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Deportated                    Year of Deportation
1. Lala Lajpat Rai                      : 1907
2. Ajit Singh                           : 1908
3. Krishna Kumar Mitra                 : 1907
4. Ashwini Kumar Dutt                  : 1908
5. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                  : 1908

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 and 1908 respectively, and Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt in December 1908.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's arrest and imprisonment in 1908, though not explicitly termed "deportation," aligns with the context of the passage which focuses on the suppression of militant nationalists. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect as they omit some correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because Ajit Singh's deportation year is incorrectly stated as 1908; it was 1907. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar events within a specific historical context.  The inclusion of partially correct and incorrect pairs acts as effective distractors, demanding careful analysis from the candidate.  The question's difficulty stems from the need for precise recall of the years of deportation, which are not always highlighted in standard historical accounts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Group Promoting Revolutionary Terrorism       Newspaper
1. V.D. Savarkar                                         : Kal
2. Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki                     : Yugantar
3. Shyamji Krishnavarma                               : Sandhya
4.  Abhinav Bharat                                      : Yugantar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat, and that the *Kal* newspaper was among those advocating revolutionary terrorism in Maharashtra.  It also details the bomb thrown by Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki, mentioning the *Yugantar* newspaper's support for such actions.  Option (c) is incorrect as it incorrectly links Abhinav Bharat with the Yugantar newspaper. Option (b) and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the association of newspapers with the named revolutionaries. While Shyamji Krishnavarma was involved in revolutionary activities abroad, the passage does not directly link him to a specific newspaper mentioned in the list, making option (b) and (d) incorrect.  The question assesses factual recall regarding the individuals and the newspapers they were associated with during the rise of revolutionary terrorism in India. The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect pairings serves as effective distractors, enhancing the question's difficulty level.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                  Year
1.  Attempt on the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal : 1906
2.  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's bomb attack     : 1908
3.  The Barisal Conference                              : 1907

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that an attempt was made on the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in December 1906, and that Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's bomb attack occurred in April 1908. The Barisal Conference is mentioned in the context of the rise of revolutionary terrorism, but the provided year (1907) is not directly stated in the passage. While it's plausible to infer a date around 1906-1908, the passage doesn't provide definitive proof to match it with 1907. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively correct based on the given text.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern definitive information from inferences. The inclusion of a plausible but ultimately unverified date in one pair adds to the question's difficulty, demanding careful attention to detail from the examinee.


**4. With reference to the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Demand                                    Prominent Advocate
1.  Larger share in government              : Dadabhai Naoroji
2.  Swarajya (self-government)            : Gopal Krishna Gokhale
3.  Indianisation of higher administrative services :  Surendranath Banerjea
4.  Abolition of Salt Tax                    :  R.C. Dutt

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly indicates that Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Surendranath Banerjea, and R.C. Dutt were all prominent advocates for their respective demands during the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement.  Dadabhai Naoroji consistently championed for a larger Indian share in the government. Gokhale and others explicitly advocated for Swarajya (self-government). Surendranath Banerjea's advocacy for Indianization of higher administrative services is mentioned in the context of administrative reforms. R.C. Dutt's critique of British economic policies implicitly supports the demand for abolition of the Salt Tax, given the context of the drain of wealth from India.  All options except (d) are incorrect as they fail to include all correctly matched pairs. The question directly assesses factual recall of individuals associated with specific demands of the early nationalist movement. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately recall and match historical figures with their corresponding political agendas.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Deportated                                    Year of Deportation
1. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh                         : 1907
2. Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt           : 1908
3. Chidambaram Pillai and Harisarvottam Rao              : 1908
4.  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru                    : 1931


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly mentions the deportations of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907, Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt in 1908, and Chidambaram Pillai and Harisarvottam Rao in 1908.  These pairings are accurately reflected in options (b) and (c). However, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were not deported; they were arrested, tried, and ultimately executed in 1931.  Option (d) incorrectly includes this inaccurate pairing. Therefore, option (c), which accurately reflects the deportations mentioned in the text, is the most appropriate choice. Option (a) is too narrow, and (b) is incomplete, failing to include the third correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of specific events and individuals within the context of the Indian nationalist movement during the early 20th century.  The distractor (d) uses prominent figures associated with revolutionary activities, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between deportation and execution within the context of the movement's timeline.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Prominent Leader
1. Abhinav Bharat                                  : Lala Hardayal
2. Anushilan Samiti                               : V.D. Savarkar
3. Gadar Party                                     : Sri Aurobindo Ghosh
4. Hindustan Republican Association                 : Bhagat Singh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat, making option (b) incorrect.  While Lala Hardayal was a significant figure in the Ghadar Party, he wasn't its organizer. Aurobindo Ghosh was associated with the nationalist movement but not the Gadar Party.  The Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, had Bhagat Singh as a prominent leader.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of revolutionary organizations and their key figures during the Indian freedom struggle. The distractors include names and organizations closely associated with the period, testing the candidate's ability to accurately match the leaders to their respective organizations.  The inclusion of Bhagat Singh, a well-known figure, and strategically incorrect pairings of other well-known figures increases the difficulty.


**3. With reference to the early phases of the Indian freedom movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                            Year
1.  First arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak for sedition : 1897
2.  Annulment of the Partition of Bengal              : 1911
3.  Formation of the Muslim League                   : 1906
4.  The Kakori Conspiracy Case                       : 1925


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions Tilak's arrest in 1897, the annulment of the Bengal partition in 1911, and the Muslim League's formation in 1906. These details are correctly paired in options (b) and (c).  However, the Kakori Conspiracy Case occurred in 1925, which falls outside the timeframe of the early phases of the freedom movement as indicated in the question and is not mentioned in the given source.  Option (d) is incorrect due to this later event. Option (a) is too narrow, and (b) is incomplete.  This question assesses factual recall of key events and their chronological order in the Indian freedom struggle, testing understanding of the historical timeline. The distractor (d) includes a relevant later event, testing the candidate's knowledge of the broader context and ability to limit their answer to the specified period.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper                                       Region of Publication
1.  Kesari                                          : Punjab
2.  Yugantar                                       : Bengal
3.  Kal                                             : Maharashtra
4.  Hitabadi                                        : Madras


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The text identifies *Yugantar* as a Bengali newspaper and *Kal* as a Marathi newspaper published in Maharashtra. These are correctly paired in options (a) and (c).  However, *Kesari* was published in Maharashtra, not Punjab, and *Hitabadi* was published in Bengal, not Madras.  These incorrect pairings render options (b), (c), and (d) incorrect.  This question tests knowledge of historical newspapers and their regional context within the Indian nationalist movement.  The distractors use names of actual newspapers but misrepresent their regions of publication, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the subject matter. The variety of options tests the candidate's ability to eliminate incorrect pairings effectively.


**5. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform                                          Feature
1. Separate Electorates                           : Introduced for Hindus only
2. Increased Elected Members in Councils        :  Majority of elected members in Imperial Legislative Council
3. Indian Representation in Viceroy's Council   :  First Indian appointed to the Viceroy's Executive Council
4.  Provincial Autonomy                           : Full provincial autonomy granted


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, not Hindus, making option (a) incorrect. While the number of elected members increased, they did not constitute a majority in the Imperial Legislative Council.  The reforms did appoint the first Indian to the Viceroy's Executive Council, and provincial autonomy was *not* fully granted. The question assesses understanding of the Morley-Minto Reforms, their features, and their limitations.  The distractors incorporate plausible but inaccurate details regarding the extent of the reforms, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge and ability to identify the correctly matched pairs amidst misleading information. The options are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between partial and complete implementation of reforms.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person Deportated                     Year of Deportation
1. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh       :  1909
2. Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt : 1908
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak                   :  1908
4. Chidambaram Pillai                  :  1908


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that in December 1908, Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were deported.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's arrest and subsequent imprisonment for six years in 1908 is also mentioned.  Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment in Madras during 1908 is also noted.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. However, Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907, not 1909, as stated in option 1. This makes option (c) the only correct answer. The question tests factual recall regarding the chronology of deportations and imprisonments of prominent Indian nationalists during the early 20th century.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like an incorrect year for Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh's deportation adds to the question's difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge for a correct response.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched year for one or more pairs.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                     Political Stance/Action
1. Aurobindo Ghose                          :  Advocated for complete independence
2. Bipin Chandra Pal                         :  Remained a constitutionalist in practice
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                    :  Openly declared the goal of 'self-government'
4. Dadabhai Naoroji                          :  Advocated for passive resistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghose is explicitly mentioned in the text as openly advocating for India's independence, making pair 1 correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji's presidential address advocating for self-government is also mentioned, confirming pair 3.  However, the text states that while militant nationalists like Bipin Chandra Pal held radical beliefs, they remained constitutionalists in practice, contrasting with option 2.  Dadabhai Naoroji did not advocate for passive resistance; that was a tactic employed by other nationalists, particularly during the later phases of the movement. Therefore, options 2 and 4 are incorrect. The question tests the understanding of the nuances in the approaches of different nationalist leaders, differentiating between their stated goals and their actual political methods.  The inclusion of partially correct and incorrect options necessitates careful analysis of the text to arrive at the accurate answer.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Year of Founding/Significant Event
1. Abhinava Bharat                         : 1908
2. Hindustan Republican Association     : 1928
3. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association : 1924
4. Ghadar Party                             : 1913


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions the founding of the Ghadar Party in 1913, making pair 4 correct.  It also mentions V.D. Savarkar organizing Abhinava Bharat in 1904, not 1908 as indicated in option 1.  The Hindustan Republican Association was founded in 1924, not 1928 (pair 2), and it later changed its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association in 1928 (pair 3).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are accurately matched. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall the founding years of various revolutionary organizations and their correct chronological order. The inclusion of incorrect years for the other organizations acts as distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical events. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched years for at least one of the organizations.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session                   President
1. Lucknow Session (1916)           :  Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2. Nagpur Session (1920)           :  C.R. Das
3. Calcutta Special Session (1920) :  Dadabhai Naoroji
4. Surat Session (1907)             :  Rash Behari Bose


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The passage mentions that the Nagpur Session of 1920 was presided over by C.R. Das, making pair 2 correct.  However, the Lucknow Session of 1916 was presided over by Gopal Krishna Gokhale. The Calcutta Special Session of 1920 was presided over by Lala Lajpat Rai and Dadabhai Naoroji presided over the 1886 session.  The Surat Session of 1907 had a different president than Rash Behari Bose.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question focuses on testing the knowledge of the presidents who presided over significant sessions of the Indian National Congress. The inclusion of incorrect presidents for other sessions makes the question challenging, demanding specific knowledge of the historical record to select the correct option.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                   Year
1.  Attempt on the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal : 1906
2.  Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's bomb attack : 1908
3.  Bomb thrown at Lord Hardinge        : 1909
4.  Chittagong Armoury Raid              : 1930


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

The text details the attempt on the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in December 1906, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's bomb attack in April 1908, and the bomb attack on Lord Hardinge in 1910. The Chittagong Armoury Raid occurred in April 1930.  All the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant events in the history of revolutionary terrorism in India.  The chronological order and specific years of these events are crucial for answering the question correctly. All options except (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question's difficulty is moderate, requiring familiarity with the events and their timelines.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Leader       Demand Advocated
1. Dadabhai Naoroji            :   Swarajya (self-government) within the British Empire
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale       :   Expansion and reform of Legislative Councils (1885-1892)
3. Pherozeshah Mehta           :   Abolition of the salt tax
4. Surendranath Banerjea      :   Indianisation of higher administrative services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist, significantly advocated for Swarajya, or self-government, within the framework of the British Empire.  This demand represented a crucial step towards greater Indian autonomy.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, another key figure, focused on reforming the existing colonial structures. His primary efforts were directed towards expanding and reforming the Legislative Councils, aiming to increase Indian representation and influence within the government. Surendranath Banerjea actively championed the Indianisation of the higher echelons of the administrative services. This demand highlighted the need for greater Indian participation in governance and a reduction in the dominance of British officials.  While Pherozeshah Mehta was a prominent leader, the abolition of the salt tax was more strongly associated with later nationalist movements like the Salt Satyagraha.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the demands advocated by these early nationalist leaders. The other options include incorrect pairings or overstate the association between the leader and the specific demand.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session             Significant Event
1. Nagpur Session (1920)       :   Formal adoption of the Non-Cooperation Movement
2. Calcutta Session (1920)      :   Congress goal changed to 'Purna Swaraj'
3. Lahore Session (1929)       :   Resolution for complete independence
4. Amritsar Session (1919)     :   Resolution to author a new Congress Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress in 1920 is correctly paired with the formal adoption of the Non-Cooperation Movement. This session marked a significant turning point, solidifying the Congress's commitment to mass non-cooperation with British rule. The Lahore Session of 1929 is accurately linked to the resolution for complete independence ('Purna Swaraj'). This declaration represented a shift towards a more radical and assertive stance in the struggle for freedom.  The Amritsar Session of 1919 saw a resolution to author a new Congress Constitution, signifying an effort to reform and strengthen the organization's structure and direction. The Calcutta Session of 1920 is incorrectly paired with the adoption of 'Purna Swaraj'; this resolution was passed at the Lahore Session in 1929.  Therefore, only options 1, 3, and 4 represent accurate pairings of Congress sessions and their significant events.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings in the other options makes them unsuitable.



**3. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Leader           Key Contribution/Demand
1. Dadabhai Naoroji            :   Formulation of the 'Drain of Wealth' theory
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale       :   Advocacy for self-government on the lines of Canada and Australia
3.  R.C. Dutt                   :   Emphasis on the development of modern industries through tariff protection
4.  Surendranath Banerjea      :   President of the first session of the Indian National Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution to the early nationalist movement was his formulation of the 'Drain of Wealth' theory. This theory meticulously analyzed the economic exploitation of India under British rule, highlighting the transfer of wealth from India to Britain. R.C. Dutt's writings and speeches strongly emphasized the need for developing modern industries in India. He advocated for the use of tariff protection and direct government aid to promote industrial growth and reduce economic dependence on Britain.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale's advocacy for self-government was indeed a significant demand, but it was more prominently associated with the later phase of the early nationalist movement, after 1905.  Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress, not Surendranath Banerjea. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately represent the key contributions and demands of these early nationalist leaders.  The other options contain inaccuracies related to the specific contributions or demands of the individuals listed.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Role/Association
1.  Motilal Nehru              :   Lawyer who gave up practice to join the movement
2.  Acharya Narendra Dev      :   Key leader in organizing national educational institutions
3.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah        :   Remained a staunch supporter of the movement throughout
4.  C. Rajagopalachari          :   A 'No-Changer' who opposed council entry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer, famously gave up his lucrative legal practice to actively participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement, demonstrating his commitment to the cause of Indian independence. Acharya Narendra Dev played a crucial role in organizing and establishing national educational institutions as an alternative to government-controlled schools and colleges during the movement.  C. Rajagopalachari, a key figure in the Congress, was a prominent 'No-Changer' who actively opposed the Swarajists' strategy of entering legislative councils, emphasizing instead on constructive work and non-cooperation. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, initially supportive, eventually distanced himself from the movement due to disagreements over its strategy and direction.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the roles and associations of these individuals with the Non-Cooperation Movement. Option 3 is incorrect as Jinnah's support was not consistent throughout the movement.  The other options contain inaccurate pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Organization    Founding Member/Key Figure
1. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) :  Bhagat Singh
2. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) :  Chandrashekhar Azad
3.  Abhinava Bharat                 :   V.D. Savarkar
4.  Anushilan Samiti                 :   Jatin Das

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Chandrashekhar Azad was a key figure in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a significant revolutionary organization that emerged from the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).  V.D. Savarkar is correctly associated with the founding and leadership of Abhinava Bharat, a notable secret society of revolutionaries active in the early 20th century.  While Bhagat Singh was a prominent member of HSRA, he was not a founding member of the HRA.  Jatin Das was a prominent revolutionary associated with the HSRA, but he is not recognized as a founding member of the Anushilan Samiti.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately represent the connections between revolutionary organizations and their key figures or founding members. Options that include incorrect pairings are thus eliminated.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the political and social movements of India during the early 20th century.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Organization          Leader/Key Figure
1. Abhinava Bharat                     :   G.D. Savarkar
2. Hindustan Republican Association  :   Chandrashekhar Azad
3. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association :  Bhagat Singh
4. Anushilan Samiti                   :   Surya Sen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because V.D. Savarkar founded Abhinava Bharat, a secret revolutionary society, and Bhagat Singh was a key leader of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), the successor to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).  Option (a) is partially correct as V.D. Savarkar is linked to Abhinava Bharat but the given leader is incorrect.  Option (c) is incorrect; while Chandrashekhar Azad was prominent in the HRA, he wasn't the founder, and Surya Sen led the Chittagong Armoury Raid, not the Anushilan Samiti, although he was associated with revolutionary groups in Bengal. Option (d) is incorrect because it only includes Bhagat Singh, ignoring the correct matching of Savarkar with Abhinava Bharat.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related revolutionary organizations and their leaders, a key aspect of understanding the Indian freedom struggle.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                     Prominent Leader
1.  Non-Cooperation Movement          :   Motilal Nehru
2.  Bardoli Satyagraha                 :   Vallabhbhai Patel
3.  Salt Satyagraha                     :   Subhas Chandra Bose
4.  Quit India Movement                :   Mahatma Gandhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Vallabhbhai Patel effectively led the Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement, and Mahatma Gandhi spearheaded the Quit India Movement. Option (a) is incorrect because, while Motilal Nehru was a prominent Congress leader, he wasn't the sole leader of the Non-Cooperation Movement; it was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi. Option (c) is incorrect; although Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent nationalist leader, he wasn't the leader of the Salt Satyagraha; it too was largely led by Gandhi. Option (d) is incorrect because it only mentions Bardoli Satyagraha and ignores the correct matching of Gandhi with the Quit India Movement. This question tests factual recall of key figures associated with different phases of the Indian independence movement, requiring the candidate to distinguish between major and minor roles played by prominent leaders.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Ideology/Group             Key Figure/Advocate
1.  Swarajist Party                     :   C. Rajagopalachari
2.  Forward Bloc                        :   Subhas Chandra Bose
3.  Congress Socialist Party             :   Jawaharlal Nehru
4.  Communist Party of India            :   M.N. Roy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc, Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent figure in the Congress Socialist Party, and M.N. Roy played a significant role in the early development of the Communist Party of India. Option (a) is partially correct; C. Rajagopalachari was associated with the No-Changers, who opposed the Swarajists' approach. However, the Swarajist Party's main leaders were C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru. Option (b) is partially correct; it correctly links Bose and Roy with their respective groups. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of C. Rajagopalachari with the Swarajist Party.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of different political ideologies and groups within the Indian National Congress and their relationship with key leaders during the inter-war period.  It highlights the diversity of thought and action within the nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary movements in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Organization              Location
1.  Kakori Conspiracy Case           :   Allahabad
2.  Chittagong Armoury Raid          :   Chittagong
3.  Assassination of John Saunders :   Lahore
4.  Formation of HSRA                :   Kanpur


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid took place in Chittagong, and the assassination of John Saunders occurred in Lahore. Option (b) is incorrect; the Kakori Conspiracy Case took place near Lucknow, not Allahabad, and the HSRA was formed in Delhi, not Kanpur. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings of the Kakori Conspiracy Case and the formation of HSRA. Option (d) is incorrect as there are more than one correctly matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of specific events and their locations, demonstrating an understanding of the geographical spread and specific actions of the revolutionary movement.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like Allahabad (close to Lucknow) and Kanpur (related to early HRA activities) increases the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual Satyagrahi            Year of Participation in Individual Satyagraha
1.  Vinoba Bhave                     :   1940
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                 :   1941
3.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel           :   1942

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru participated in the Individual Satyagraha in 1941.  Option (a) is incorrect; while Vinoba Bhave was indeed a prominent participant in the Individual Satyagraha, the year given is incorrect.  Option (c) is incorrect for the same reason as option (a).  Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of the timeline of the Individual Satyagraha, a less emphasized aspect of the freedom struggle. The incorrect dates act as effective distractors, making the question challenging for those without a precise understanding of the historical timeline.  The question tests factual recall and precise chronological understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Congress Session President                     Year
1. Haripura Session                               :   1937
2. Tripuri Session                                 :   1939
3. Lahore Session (Poorna Swaraj Resolution) :   1929

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Haripura session of the Indian National Congress was held in 1938, not 1937, and was presided over by Subhas Chandra Bose.  The Tripuri session, also presided over by Subhas Chandra Bose, was indeed held in 1939. The Lahore session, where the crucial resolution demanding "Poorna Swaraj" (complete independence) was adopted, took place in 1929 under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the year for the Haripura session is wrong. Option (b) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.  Understanding the chronology of significant Congress sessions and their presiding officers is crucial for comprehending the evolution of the Indian National Congress and the changing dynamics of the freedom struggle. This question tests the candidate's factual recall and analytical skills in Indian history.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                                    Ideology/Stance
1. Mahatma Gandhi                             :   Complete Independence through Non-violent means
2. Subhas Chandra Bose                        :   Dominion Status
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                             :   Purna Swaraj through Non-violent means

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's unwavering commitment to achieving complete independence for India through non-violent means (satyagraha) is well-documented.  Subhas Chandra Bose, unlike Gandhi, was a proponent of Purna Swaraj (complete independence), but he was not averse to exploring other means to achieve it, including alliances with the Axis powers during World War II. This demonstrates a significant difference in their approaches to the freedom struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru, while initially advocating for dominion status, later became a staunch supporter of Purna Swaraj and the use of non-violent methods.  Therefore, only pair 1 accurately reflects the leader's ideology and stance. Option (b) is incorrect because Bose's stance on independence and methods is misrepresented. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes Purna Swaraj through non-violent means to Nehru alone, ignoring the evolution of his views. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pairs 2 and 3. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse ideologies within the Indian National Congress and their impact on the freedom struggle.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                   Founder/Key Figure
1. Anushilan Samiti                              :   V. D. Savarkar
2. India Independence League                   :   Rash Behari Bose
3. Forward Bloc                                  :   Subhas Chandra Bose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The India Independence League was indeed founded by Rash Behari Bose, a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement.  The Forward Bloc, a political party formed by Subhas Chandra Bose, is another accurately matched pair. However, the Anushilan Samiti's founding is often attributed to figures like Pulin Behari Das and Aurobindo Ghosh, not V.D. Savarkar, who was associated with the Abhinav Bharat.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because Savarkar's association with Anushilan Samiti is inaccurate. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the founding of Anushilan Samiti to Savarkar. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of revolutionary organizations and their key leaders, demonstrating an understanding of the diverse strands within the Indian independence movement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                                    Prominent Leader
1. Swadeshi Movement (Bengal)                    :    Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2. Non-Cooperation Movement                     :    Mahatma Gandhi
3. Bardoli Satyagraha                             :    Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement was undoubtedly led by Mahatma Gandhi, and the Bardoli Satyagraha was successfully spearheaded by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.  However, the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal, while having many leaders, wasn't primarily associated with Gopal Krishna Gokhale.  Gokhale was a prominent Moderate leader, but his primary focus was on constitutional means of reform, while the Swadeshi Movement included a more assertive and at times militant approach. Key leaders of the Bengal Swadeshi movement included Surendranath Banerjea, Aurobindo Ghosh, and Bipin Chandra Pal. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as Gokhale's primary association with the Bengal Swadeshi movement is inaccurate. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes the mismatched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect as it misses the correctly matched pair 2. This question tests the candidate's understanding of different phases and leaders within the Indian independence movement, requiring knowledge of key figures and their roles in specific events.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Publication                                     Author
1. Hind Swaraj                                    :    Jawaharlal Nehru
2.  The Indian Struggle                           :    Subhas Chandra Bose
3.  Autobiography                               :    Mahatma Gandhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose authored "The Indian Struggle," a significant work detailing his perspective on the Indian independence movement.  However, "Hind Swaraj" was written by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru, and Jawaharlal Nehru wrote "Toward Freedom" and his autobiography is titled "Toward Freedom" and "An Autobiography".   Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes "Hind Swaraj" to Nehru. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes "Hind Swaraj" to Nehru and the autobiography to Gandhi. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes the autobiography to Gandhi. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of important publications related to the Indian independence movement and their authors, requiring detailed knowledge of the writings of key figures.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Reform                                  Year
1. Indian Councils Act                           :   1909
2. Morley-Minto Reforms                         :   1892
3. Government of India Act                       :   1935

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act was indeed passed in 1909, and the Government of India Act was enacted in 1935. However, the Morley-Minto Reforms are synonymous with the Indian Councils Act of 1909, not 1892. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 introduced some limited reforms but was not known as the Morley-Minto Reforms. The Morley-Minto Reforms were a significant step towards expanding Indian participation in the legislative councils, although it fell short of fulfilling nationalist demands.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 3. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly associates the Morley-Minto Reforms with 1892. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key legislative acts and reforms during the British Raj, requiring a precise understanding of their timing and significance.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                     Association/Role
1.  Annie Besant                               :   Theosophical Society
2.  Mohammad Ali Jinnah                         :   Muslim League
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                           :   Ghadar Party

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Annie Besant's prominent role in the Theosophical Society is well-established. Similarly, Mohammad Ali Jinnah's leadership within the Muslim League is widely known. However, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was not associated with the Ghadar Party. The Ghadar Party was formed primarily by Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus in the United States and Canada, aiming for an armed rebellion against British rule in India.  While Tilak was a significant figure in the Indian independence movement, his activism and ideology differed significantly from the Ghadar Party's. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect due to the inaccurate association of Tilak with the Ghadar Party. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccurate association of Tilak with the Ghadar Party. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 3. This question tests the candidate's awareness of prominent figures in the Indian independence movement and their affiliations, requiring an understanding of the different organizations and their goals.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                               Year
1.  Partition of Bengal                          :   1911
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre                  :   1919
3.  Non-Cooperation Movement Begins           :   1920

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre occurred in 1919, and the Non-Cooperation Movement commenced in 1920.  However, the Partition of Bengal, which sparked the Swadeshi movement, happened in 1905, not 1911. The partition was later annulled in 1911. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly associates the Partition of Bengal with 1911. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly associates the Partition of Bengal with 1911. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly associates the Partition of Bengal with 1911. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant historical events in India and their timelines, highlighting the importance of accurate chronological understanding.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                            Significant Contribution/Association
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                          :   Drain Theory
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale                     :   Swarajya within the British Empire
3.  Motilal Nehru                             :   Nehru Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's articulation of the "Drain Theory," highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule, is a well-known contribution. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent Moderate leader, advocated for Swarajya (self-rule) within the framework of the British Empire, emphasizing gradual constitutional reforms. Motilal Nehru chaired the committee that drafted the Nehru Report, a significant document outlining a proposed constitution for India.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the contributions of key figures in the early Indian nationalist movement, requiring knowledge of their economic and political ideas.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

  Leader                                       Major Political Association/Party
1.  C.R. Das                                     :   Forward Bloc
2.  Motilal Nehru                               :   Swarajist Party
3.  Vallabhbhai Patel                           :   Indian National Congress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Motilal Nehru was a key leader of the Swarajist Party, a significant faction within the Indian National Congress that advocated for participation in legislative councils. Vallabhbhai Patel remained a dedicated member and leader of the Indian National Congress throughout his career.  However, C.R. Das was not primarily associated with the Forward Bloc; that party was founded by Subhas Chandra Bose.  While Das was a prominent leader in the Swarajist movement, he did not found the Forward Bloc. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it wrongly associates C.R. Das with the Forward Bloc. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly associates C.R. Das with the Forward Bloc. Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 3. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the various political factions and parties within the Indian independence movement, requiring knowledge of their leaders and ideologies.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Nationalist Organization        Location of Founding/Primary Activity
1. British India Association            :   Madras
2. Bombay Presidency Association      :   Calcutta
3. Poona Sarvajanik Sabha             :   Bombay
4. Madras Mahajan Sabha              :   Poona
5. Indian Association                  :   Madras

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The British India Association was founded in Calcutta as a merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society.  The Bombay Presidency Association was indeed established in Bombay. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded in Poona. The Madras Mahajan Sabha was established in Madras. The Indian Association was founded in Calcutta.  Option (c) is correct because only the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's location is accurately matched. The other options incorrectly pair organizations with locations where they did not originate or primarily function.  This question tests factual recall of early nationalist organizations and their geographical association, a crucial aspect of understanding the regional variations and evolution of the Indian nationalist movement.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge, highlighting the importance of not relying on general assumptions about the location of these organizations based on their names alone.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                  Association/Organization
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                         :   Indian National Conference
2. Surendranath Banerjea                   :   East India Association
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale                    :   British Indian Association
4. A.O. Hume                               :   Servants of India Society
5. Sayyid Ahmad Khan                       :   Scientific Society

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent member and thrice president of the Indian National Congress, not the Indian National Conference. Surendranath Banerjea was a key figure in the founding of the Indian Association. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was associated with the Servants of India Society and played a significant role in the British Indian Association.  A.O. Hume is known for his crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, but not the Servants of India Society. Sayyid Ahmad Khan founded the Scientific Society. Option (d) is correct because it accurately matches Surendranath Banerjea with the Indian Association, Gopal Krishna Gokhale with the British Indian Association, and Sayyid Ahmad Khan with the Scientific Society. The other options include incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between individuals and their actual affiliations within the complex landscape of early Indian nationalist organizations. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations.


**3. With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Primary Goal/Characteristic
1.  Bengal British Indian Society              :   Advocated for complete independence
2.  Madras Native Association                  :   Focused primarily on landholder interests
3.  Bombay Association                         :   Promoted general public interests
4.  British India Association                   :   Merged with the Indian Association in 1886
5.  East India Association                     :   Operated primarily in London

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bengal British Indian Society focused on general public interests, not complete independence. The Madras Native Association also aimed for general public interests, not just landholder concerns.  The Bombay Association similarly aimed for general public interests. The British India Association did not merge with the Indian Association in 1886; the Indian National Congress absorbed the Indian Association. The East India Association operated primarily from London to lobby British opinion on Indian issues. Option (d) is correct because it accurately reflects the primary goal or characteristic of the Bombay Association, the relationship between the British India Association and the Indian National Congress, and the location of the East India Association's operations.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nuances and goals of these early organizations, testing their ability to distinguish between similar organizations and their objectives.  Incorrect options contain plausible but inaccurate details, demanding precise factual knowledge.


**4. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Demand/Objective                          Prominent Advocate/Organization
1.  Swarajya (self-government)              :   Raja Rammohun Roy
2.  Expansion of Legislative Councils        :   Dadabhai Naoroji
3.  Boycott of British Goods                 :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
4.  Tariff Protection for Indian Industries   :   Indian Association
5.  Reduction of Land Revenue               :   Early Congress leaders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While Raja Rammohun Roy was a pioneer of reform, the specific demand for Swarajya as a formal political goal emerged later with the rise of the Indian National Congress. Dadabhai Naoroji, while advocating for greater Indian representation,  was most prominently associated with the drain of wealth theory and economic critique of British rule.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent voice for constitutional reforms within the Congress but not specifically for boycotts of British goods.  The Indian Association did advocate for various reforms, but tariff protection wasn't their primary focus.  Early Congress leaders consistently championed the reduction of land revenue to alleviate peasant distress. Option (d) is correct because it correctly matches the Indian Association with the advocacy of tariff protection and early Congress leaders with the goal of land revenue reduction.  The other options include plausible but inaccurate pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific individuals and their association with particular demands within the evolving Indian nationalist movement. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to connect specific demands with their primary proponents.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Policy                                   Year

3.  Indian Councils Act                           :   1892
4.  Partition of Bengal                           :   1906
5.  First World War                              :   1916

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, not 1886.  The Vernacular Press Act was passed in 1878. The Indian Councils Act was enacted in 1892. The Partition of Bengal occurred in 1905, not 1906. The First World War began in 1914, not 1916. Option (b) is correct, as it accurately pairs the Vernacular Press Act with 1878, the Indian Councils Act with 1892, and the Partition of Bengal with 1905.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of important dates in Indian history related to the British administration and the rise of the nationalist movement. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's accurate recall of these dates, highlighting the importance of precision in historical knowledge.  The question assesses factual recall of key dates, a fundamental requirement for UPSC examination preparation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and given a six-year prison sentence in 1908. Krishna Kumar Mitra was among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908.  Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment is also mentioned as occurring in 1908. Therefore, option (b) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of individuals and events related to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, highlighting the government's repressive measures against prominent figures.  Understanding the context of these deportations and imprisonments is crucial for comprehending the intensification of nationalist sentiment during this period.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader  Political Ideology/Affiliation  
1. Aurobindo Ghose                : Constitutionalist in practice
2. Bipin Chandra Pal               : Extremist
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                 : Tilakites/Extremists (while studying in England)
4. Dadabhai Naoroji                 : Advocated for ‘self-government’
5.  Gokhale                          : President of the Congress, 1905


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the individuals' political leanings and actions.  Bipin Chandra Pal was indeed a prominent extremist leader. Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, identified with the Tilakites or Extremists. Dadabhai Naoroji famously advocated for self-government in his presidential address. Gokhale's presidency of the Congress in 1905 is also factually correct. Aurobindo Ghose, while holding radical nationalist beliefs, is accurately described as a constitutionalist in practice, meaning he operated within existing legal frameworks despite his revolutionary views. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the examinee's understanding of the diverse spectrum of political ideologies within the Indian nationalist movement, distinguishing between the moderates and extremists and their respective approaches.  It also tests the recall of specific figures and their positions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct as all the pairs are correctly matched.  *Yugantar*, *Sandhya*, and *Kal* are all mentioned in the text as newspapers that advocated revolutionary terrorism.  *India* was a journal used to propagate Indian views in Britain. The *Amrita Bazar Patrika* is mentioned as reporting on Tilak's imprisonment, highlighting its role in disseminating news and shaping public opinion. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the media landscape during the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement and its role in shaping public opinion and disseminating information about revolutionary activities. It also assesses the understanding of the different approaches within the movement.

(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The partition of Bengal directly triggered the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced the detrimental policy of separate electorates for Muslims. The Surat Split formally divided the Congress. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was indeed criticized for being insufficient.  The annulment of the Partition of Bengal in 1911 was a key government strategy to curb the escalating revolutionary terrorism.  Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer; options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete. The question tests the candidate's understanding of key events and policies shaping the Indian nationalist movement, focusing on their causes, consequences, and the government's responses.  It assesses factual recall and the ability to connect historical events.

V.D. Savarkar's role in organizing the Abhinava Bharat is accurate. Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki's attempt to bomb a carriage in 1908 is also correctly stated. Shyamji Krishnavarma and Madam Cama's revolutionary activities in London and Europe respectively are also mentioned in the text. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of prominent individuals and groups involved in revolutionary activities during this period, testing factual recall and understanding of their contributions to the nationalist movement.  It highlights the diverse geographical reach of revolutionary efforts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.

(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states the deportations of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 following Punjab riots, the deportation of nine Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, in December 1908, Tilak's arrest and six-year sentence in 1908, and Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment in Madras in 1908.  All four pairs accurately reflect these historical events. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests factual recall of key figures and events in the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The inclusion of multiple correct pairs increases the difficulty and necessitates careful consideration of each option.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Leader                       Ideology/Approach
    1. Aurobindo Ghose         :  Advocated passive resistance and boycott
    2. Bipin Chandra Pal        :  Militant nationalist, later retired from active politics
    3. Jawaharlal Nehru          :  Extremist, influenced by Tilak's activities
    4. Dadabhai Naoroji          : Openly declared the goal of the movement as 'self-government'


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly mentions Aurobindo Ghose's advocacy of passive resistance and boycott as part of a strategy to make British administration impossible. It also highlights Bipin Chandra Pal as a militant nationalist who later withdrew from active politics.  Jawaharlal Nehru's description in his autobiography confirms his identification with Tilak and the Extremists. Dadabhai Naoroji's declaration of 'self-government' as the movement's goal is explicitly stated. Option (c) incorrectly includes Nehru's classification as an extremist, which while true, is not the primary ideological descriptor provided for him in the text. The question tests understanding of the different ideological streams and leadership styles within the nationalist movement. The subtle difference between Nehru's actual ideology and his description in the text adds to the difficulty.


**3. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Individual     Action/Association
    1. Khudiram Bose             :  Bombing attempt on Kingsford in Muzzaffarpur

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly details Khudiram Bose's involvement in the Muzaffarpur bombing, V.D. Savarkar's founding of Abhinava Bharat, the widespread network of Anushilan Samiti with its large Dacca branch, and the leadership roles of Shyamji Krishnavarma, V.D. Savarkar, and Har Dayal in London. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one of the accurately matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of the key players and organizations involved in the revolutionary terrorist movement, highlighting the geographical spread and international connections of the movement. The inclusion of multiple correct matches increases the question's difficulty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Event                                    Year
    1.  Partition of Bengal                     : 1905

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text mentions the partition of Bengal in 1905 and the Surat split in 1907. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre also occurred in 1919.  However, the provided text does not contain information about the Delhi Conspiracy Case, making option (d) incorrect. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they don't include all the correctly matched pairs. This question tests the examinee's understanding of the chronology of significant events in the Indian nationalist movement and their ability to identify inaccurate information among plausible distractors.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Leader                       Role/Action
    1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah     : Left the Congress due to disagreements with the non-cooperation approach
    2.  Mahatma Gandhi           :  Led the movement and later suspended it after the Chauri Chaura incident
    3.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha       :  Abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey
    4.  C.R. Das                  :  Presided over the Ahmedabad Congress session in 1921 (while in jail)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

Gandhi's leadership of the movement and its suspension after Chauri Chaura are explicitly stated. Kemal Pasha's abolition of the Caliphate is also mentioned as a factor ending the Khilafat movement's relevance.  The text confirms that C.R. Das presided over the Ahmedabad session while imprisoned.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses the examinee's knowledge of the key figures and events of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement and their ability to discern correct information from a set of plausible options.  The inclusion of multiple correct answers adds to the question's difficulty.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

The passage directly mentions the Indian Naval Mutiny, the arrival of the Cabinet Mission, and the independence of India and Pakistan in the specified years. While the integration of princely states wasn't completed in a single year, the majority of the process was finalized by 1948, as the text indicates.  Therefore all four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the accurately matched pairs. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of the immediate post-independence period and their ability to interpret information regarding the timeline of events. The inclusion of a partially true statement (Princely States integration) within a set of completely true statements adds to the question's difficulty and requires careful analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                           Action/Association
1. Surendranath Banerjea           :   Established the Indian Association in 1876
2. Aurobindo Ghosh                 :   Principal of National College, Calcutta
3. Bipin Chandra Pal                :   Associated with the Swadeshi Movement
4. Lala Lajpat Rai                  :   Deportation in 1907 following Punjab riots
5.  Khudiram Bose                  :   Attempted to assassinate Kingsford in Muzaffarpur


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on historical accounts of the Indian independence movement.  Surendranath Banerjea is well-known for establishing the Indian Association in 1876, a significant early nationalist organization. Aurobindo Ghosh's role as principal of the National College, a nationalist institution established as part of the Swadeshi movement, is a documented fact.  Bipin Chandra Pal was a prominent leader of the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, actively participating in its various facets. Lala Lajpat Rai's deportation in 1907 following the Punjab riots is a well-established event in the history of the Indian freedom struggle. Finally, Khudiram Bose's attempt to assassinate Kingsford in Muzaffarpur is a key event in the early revolutionary phase of the movement.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit one or more of these historically accurate pairings, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the key figures and events of this period. The comprehensive nature of option (c) makes it the only correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                     Year
1. Partition of Bengal                      :   1911
2.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre              :   1905
3.  Formation of the National Council of Education :   1906
4.  Surat Split of the Indian National Congress:   1907
5.  First World War ended                 :   1918


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The partition of Bengal was annulled in 1911, making pair 1 correct. The Surat Split, a significant event dividing the Indian National Congress into moderate and extremist factions, occurred in 1907, making pair 4 correct. The First World War concluded in 1918, making pair 5 correct. However, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre occurred in 1919, not 1905. The National Council of Education was established in 1906, but the question's distractor attempts to confuse the examinee with a different date. Options (a), (b), and (c) include one or more incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in answering this question.  Option (d) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a clear understanding of the chronology of significant events in early 20th-century Indian history.


**3. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader/Figure                     Contribution/Association
1. Rabindranath Tagore            :   Composed patriotic songs
2. Acharya P.C. Ray               :   Established the Bengal Chemical Swadeshi Stores
3.  Lord Curzon                     :   Declared the partition of Bengal
4.  Anandamohan Bose              :   Laid the foundation of a Federation Hall
5.  Abdul Rasul                     :   Prominent Muslim participant


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect aspects of the Swadeshi Movement and related events.  Rabindranath Tagore's contribution to the movement through his patriotic songs is widely acknowledged. Acharya P.C. Ray's establishment of the Bengal Chemical Swadeshi Stores is a key example of the movement's economic dimension. Lord Curzon's role in the partition of Bengal, which directly spurred the Swadeshi Movement, is a well-known historical fact.  Anandamohan Bose's act of laying the foundation of a Federation Hall symbolized the movement's aim of maintaining Bengal's unity. Finally, Abdul Rasul's participation highlights the involvement of prominent Muslims in the movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) demonstrate a partial understanding of the movement, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (c) correctly matches all pairs, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the Swadeshi Movement and its key figures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Movement        Key Figure/Leader
1. Abhinav Bharat Society      :   Vinayak Damodar Savarkar
2. Anushilan Samiti             :   Khudiram Bose
3.  Forward Bloc                  :   Subhas Chandra Bose
4.  Ghadar Party                  :   Lala Hardayal
5.  Khudai Khidmatgars          :   Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links an organization or movement to one of its key leaders. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar founded the Abhinav Bharat Society, a revolutionary organization. Khudiram Bose was a prominent member of the Anushilan Samiti, a revolutionary group active in Bengal. Subhas Chandra Bose led the Forward Bloc, a faction within the Indian National Congress. Lala Hardayal was a significant figure in the Ghadar Party, a transnational revolutionary organization. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as Badshah Khan, led the Khudai Khidmatgars, a non-violent Pashtun nationalist movement. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate incomplete knowledge of the leaders associated with these various movements. Option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the key figures and their respective roles in different facets of the Indian nationalist movement.  This showcases a grasp of both revolutionary and non-violent strands within the struggle.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                     Action/Contribution
1.  Ali Brothers                         :   Launched the Khilafat Movement
2.  Gandhi                               :   Returned the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal
3.  C.R. Das                             :   Presided over the Ahmedabad Congress Session (1921)
4.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha                 :   Abolished the Caliphate in Turkey
5.  Jatin Das                            :   Achieved martyrdom during a hunger strike


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement and related events.  The Ali brothers were instrumental in launching the Khilafat Movement, which became intertwined with the Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhi's return of the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal symbolized his commitment to the Non-Cooperation Movement. C.R. Das, although imprisoned, was the officially designated president of the Ahmedabad Congress Session of 1921 (Hakim Ajmal Khan acted as president). Mustafa Kemal Pasha's abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey significantly impacted the Khilafat Movement and, consequently, the Non-Cooperation Movement. Jatin Das's martyrdom during a hunger strike is a significant event during this period. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate an incomplete understanding of the key figures and events. Option (d) correctly identifies all matched pairs, showcasing a strong grasp of the Non-Cooperation Movement's context and key actors. The inclusion of Mustafa Kemal Pasha and Jatin Das highlights a nuanced understanding of the movement's broader historical context.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                      Leader/Person Associated
1. Kakori Train Robbery Case                 :   Chandra Shekhar Azad
2.  Assassination of British Police Officer :   Surya Sen
3.  Chittagong Armoury Raid                 :   Bhagat Singh
4.  Bombay Textile Mill Strike               :   Subhash Chandra Bose


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Kakori Train Robbery, a significant event in the Indian independence movement, involved many revolutionaries, with Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah being among those executed.  While Chandra Shekhar Azad was a prominent revolutionary figure, he wasn't directly involved in the planning or execution of the Kakori Conspiracy.  Option 1 is partially correct because it associates the event with a prominent revolutionary from the same era.  Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, famously assassinated a British police officer in retaliation for the lathi charge on Lala Lajpat Rai.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid was masterminded and led by Surya Sen.  Subhash Chandra Bose, although instrumental in resolving labor disputes, such as the Tata Iron and Steel Works strike, wasn't directly involved with the Bombay Textile Mill Strike.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the leader-event connection. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairs with inaccurate leader-event pairings.  Understanding the key players and their specific roles in various revolutionary activities is crucial for comprehending the multifaceted nature of the Indian freedom struggle.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization Name                         Year of Founding/Significant Event
1. Hindustan Republican Association         :   1928
2. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association :   1931
3. Abhinav Bharat Society                   :   1906


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Abhinav Bharat Society was indeed founded in 1906 by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was established in 1924, not 1928, with the aim of organizing an armed revolution.  It later transformed into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928, not 1931, under the leadership of Chandrashekhar Azad, reflecting the growing socialist influence within the revolutionary movement.  The dates given in options 1 and 2 are incorrect, highlighting the importance of precise chronological knowledge in understanding the evolution of revolutionary organizations during the Indian freedom struggle. Option (d) is correct because it identifies the correct founding year of the Abhinav Bharat Society. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the erroneous timelines associated with the HRA and HSRA.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                                 Ideology/Association
1. Bhagat Singh                              :   Passive Resistance
2.  Mahatma Gandhi                          :   Revolutionary Terrorism
3.  Aurobindo Ghosh                         :   Militant Nationalism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Aurobindo Ghosh is correctly associated with militant nationalism, advocating for more assertive and radical methods in the fight for Indian independence.  Bhagat Singh was a prominent figure in the revolutionary terrorism movement, known for his revolutionary actions and socialist leanings, not passive resistance. Mahatma Gandhi's ideology was centered on non-violent resistance (Satyagraha), not revolutionary terrorism. Option (c) is correct because it accurately links Aurobindo Ghosh with his advocacy for militant nationalism. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched ideologies and associations with Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi.  This question highlights the diversity of approaches within the Indian independence movement, requiring an understanding of the distinct ideologies and actions of key figures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                            Significant Contribution/Action
1. Lord Irwin                                :   Introduced the Government of India Act, 1935
2.  Lord Curzon                              :   Cancelled the Partition of Bengal
3.  Lord Montague and Lord Chelmsford     :   Announced the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms were indeed announced in 1918 by the respective individuals.  Lord Irwin is associated with the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and not the Government of India Act of 1935.  Lord Curzon was responsible for the Partition of Bengal, which was later annulled by the British government, but not by Lord Curzon himself.  Therefore, only pair 3 accurately reflects the correct association between the political figure and their contribution. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include inaccurate associations between the listed political figures and their actions.  This question tests the knowledge of significant historical figures and their roles in shaping the political landscape of India during the British Raj.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Movement/Event                             Key Characteristic/Outcome
1. Non-Cooperation Movement                 :   Completely successful in achieving Swaraj
2.  Simon Commission                         :   All members were Indians
3.  Second Round Table Conference           :   Led to immediate grant of Dominion Status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, while significant, was ultimately suspended by Mahatma Gandhi due to the Chauri Chaura incident, and did not achieve complete success in gaining Swaraj. The Simon Commission was notably composed entirely of British members, leading to widespread protests and boycotts. The Second Round Table Conference, while a step in constitutional discussions, did not immediately result in the granting of Dominion Status to India. Therefore, all three pairs present inaccurate information.  Option (d) is correct because none of the pairs accurately reflects the given characteristics or outcomes. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because each pair contains a factual inaccuracy.  This question assesses the understanding of major events in the Indian independence movement, emphasizing the need for accurate recall of details and outcomes.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary/Leader                       Associated Group/Action
1.  Rash Behari Bose                         :   Ghadar Party
2.  Surya Sen                                 :   Kakori Conspiracy
3.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan                 :   Khudai Khidmatgars


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Rash Behari Bose was indeed involved in the Ghadar Party's revolutionary activities.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the Frontier Gandhi, effectively led the Khudai Khidmatgars (Servants of God), a non-violent movement in the North-West Frontier Province.  Surya Sen was the leader of the Chittagong Armoury Raid, not involved in the Kakori Conspiracy. Option (b) is correct as it correctly identifies the association of Rash Behari Bose with the Ghadar Party and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan with the Khudai Khidmatgars. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include inaccurate associations, particularly the misattribution of Surya Sen's role. This question tests the knowledge of various revolutionary figures and their associations with specific movements and actions during the Indian freedom struggle.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                      Slogan/Movement
1.  Bhagat Singh                 :   Home Rule League
2.  S.C. Bose                    :   Inquilab Zindabad
3.  M.K. Gandhi                  :   Quit India Movement
4.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak          :   Swadeshi Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because S.C. Bose is associated with the "Inquilab Zindabad" slogan, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a prominent leader of the Swadeshi Movement.  The other options are incorrect. Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in the Home Rule League, although he was a prominent revolutionary.  While M.K. Gandhi led many movements, including the Quit India Movement,  the connection between him and that movement is not exclusive; many other leaders were involved. The question tests factual recall of key figures and their association with specific movements and slogans.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of related figures and events, making it challenging to simply guess the correct answer.  Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly links Bhagat Singh to the Home Rule League.  Option (c) includes a correct pairing (2 and 4) but also incorrectly adds Gandhi’s association with the Quit India movement as exclusive, which is not accurate. Option (d) is incorrect as it erroneously connects all four leaders to the mentioned movements/slogans.  Understanding the nuances of the Indian independence movement and the contributions of various leaders is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Indian history.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Viceroy                     Significant Event
1. Lord Curzon                  :   Bengal Partition
2. Lord Minto                   :   Home Rule Movement
3. Lord Hardinge                 :   Ghadar Revolution
4. Lord Lytton                   :   Indian Councils Act of 1892

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct as Lord Curzon is directly associated with the Bengal Partition. The other options are incorrect.  The Home Rule Movement primarily occurred during the viceroyalty of Lord Hardinge, not Lord Minto. While Lord Hardinge's tenure saw the aftermath of the Ghadar Revolution, he wasn't directly involved in its cause or outbreak.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was passed during the viceroyalty of Lord Lansdowne, not Lord Lytton. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the chronological sequence of events and their association with specific viceroys. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of the periods and key events during the tenures of various viceroys.  The question's difficulty arises from the need to accurately recall the viceroy associated with each event and to distinguish between closely related events and time periods.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair viceroys with events that occurred during different administrations, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of Indian history.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Role/Contribution
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji           :   First woman graduate to address a Congress session
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale      :   Advocated Swaraj within the British Empire
3.  Kadambini Ganguli          :   Thrice elected President of the Indian National Congress
4.  W.C. Bonnerjee             :   Presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Gopal Krishna Gokhale is accurately linked to advocating Swaraj within the British Empire, and W.C. Bonnerjee correctly presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress.  The other options are incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji was thrice elected President, not Kadambini Ganguli.  Kadambini Ganguli was the first woman graduate of Calcutta University to address a Congress session, not Dadabhai Naoroji. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent figures in the early Indian National Congress and their contributions. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, requiring the candidate to possess accurate knowledge of the roles played by these historical figures.   The difficulty stems from the need for specific factual recall about the contributions and roles of these individuals in shaping the early years of the Indian National Congress.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge to answer correctly.


**4. With reference to the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following pairs:**

   Demand/Reform                   Characteristic
1. Expansion of Legislative Councils :   Economic Reform
2. Indianisation of higher administrative services :   Administrative Reform
3.  Reduction of land revenue        :   Constitutional Reform
4.  Rapid development of modern industries :   Economic Reform

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. The Indianisation of higher administrative services falls under administrative reforms, and the rapid development of modern industries is an economic reform. The other options are incorrect. The expansion of Legislative Councils was a constitutional, not an economic reform. The reduction of land revenue, while having economic implications, was primarily a part of the broader economic strategy, rather than a distinct economic reform in itself. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the different types of reforms advocated during the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement.  The incorrect options are carefully crafted to include plausible distractors, demanding a precise understanding of the categorization of reforms. The difficulty lies in differentiating between closely related concepts such as constitutional, administrative, and economic reforms, and accurately associating specific demands with the appropriate category. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect classifications, highlighting the need for accurate understanding of the context and nature of these reforms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper                     Ideology/Focus
1.  Amrita Bazar Patrika         :   Revolutionary Terrorism
2.  Yugantar                      :   Militant Nationalism
3.  Kal                           :   Moderate Nationalism
4.  India                         :   Advocacy of Indian interests in Britain

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  *Yugantar* was a newspaper associated with militant nationalism, and *India* was a journal published in Britain to advocate for Indian interests. The other options are incorrect. *Amrita Bazar Patrika*, while nationalist, was not primarily focused on revolutionary terrorism.  *Kal* was associated with the nationalist movement in Maharashtra but was not specifically aligned with moderate nationalism exclusively. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different newspapers associated with the Indian nationalist movement and their ideological leanings.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate’s awareness of various publications and their roles, making simple guessing difficult. The difficulty level stems from the need to accurately recall the specific ideological focus of each newspaper and to differentiate between closely related ideologies within the nationalist movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, requiring a precise understanding of the historical context and the role of these publications.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary Organization          Leader/Key Figure
1. Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) :  Ramprasad Bismil
2. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) :  Chandrashekhar Azad
3. Abhinav Bharat                         :  V.D. Savarkar
4.  Forward Bloc                          :  Subhash Chandra Bose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), were significant revolutionary organizations in India during the struggle for independence. Ramprasad Bismil was a key founder and leader of the HRA, while Chandrashekhar Azad played a crucial role in its transformation into the HSRA and its subsequent activities. V.D. Savarkar founded the Abhinav Bharat, another revolutionary organization known for its clandestine activities. Subhash Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress, later formed the Forward Bloc, a separate political party advocating for complete independence.  These organizations, while employing different strategies, all contributed to the overall struggle against British rule, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the resistance. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the key revolutionary organizations and their leaders during this period.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                     Location
1. Kakori Conspiracy Case              :   Kanpur
2. Lahore Conspiracy Case              :   Lahore
3. Chittagong Armoury Raid             :   Chittagong
4.  Salt Satyagraha Movement           :   Dandi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Lahore Conspiracy Case, which involved Bhagat Singh and his associates, took place in Lahore. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, occurred in Chittagong. The Dandi March, a crucial event in the Salt Satyagraha, commenced from Sabarmati Ashram and culminated at Dandi.  Option 1 is incorrect as the Kakori Conspiracy, while involving a train robbery near Lucknow, is often associated with Kanpur due to its planning and aftermath. This highlights the importance of precisely understanding the geographic locations associated with key events in Indian history. The other options incorrectly exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific locations related to significant events in the Indian freedom struggle.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Ideology/Association
1. Bhagat Singh                            :   Communism
2. Subhas Chandra Bose                    :   Fascism
3. Mahatma Gandhi                          :   Ahimsa and Satyagraha
4.  Jayaprakash Narayan                   :  Socialism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bhagat Singh's association with socialist and communist ideologies is well-documented; his writings and actions reflect his belief in a socialist revolution.  Mahatma Gandhi's unwavering commitment to Ahimsa (non-violence) and Satyagraha (non-violent resistance) is a cornerstone of his philosophy and political strategy.  Jayaprakash Narayan was a prominent socialist leader and thinker in India. Option 2 is incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose was a left-leaning nationalist, he did not explicitly associate himself with Fascism, though he did seek alliances with Axis powers during World War II for strategic reasons.  This demonstrates the need to understand nuances in the ideological affiliations of prominent figures in Indian history. The other options incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the complex ideological landscape of the Indian freedom struggle and the varying approaches adopted by key figures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party/Organization          Key Policy/Objective
1. Indian National Congress (during the Non-Cooperation Movement) :   Purna Swaraj
2. Muslim League (Lahore Session, 1940) :   Demand for Pakistan
3. Forward Bloc                            :    Dominion Status
4.  Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) :   Socialist Revolution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian National Congress, under the influence of the Non-Cooperation Movement, adopted the goal of Purna Swaraj (complete independence).  The Lahore Resolution of the Muslim League in 1940 formally demanded the creation of Pakistan. The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) explicitly aimed for a socialist revolution in India. Option 3 is incorrect; the Forward Bloc, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, advocated for complete independence, not Dominion Status. This highlights the need for accurate understanding of the stated goals and policies of various political organizations during the Indian freedom struggle. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair related to the Forward Bloc's objectives.  This question tests the candidate's ability to recall the key policy positions and objectives of different political groups during a pivotal period in Indian history.


**5. With reference to the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual Satyagraha Participants          Notable Contribution/Association
1. Vinoba Bhave                             :   First to offer Satyagraha
2. Jawaharlal Nehru                           :   Second to offer Satyagraha
3. Mahatma Gandhi                           :   Initiated the Individual Satyagraha Campaign
4.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                 :   Led the Bardoli Satyagraha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vinoba Bhave was indeed the first prominent individual to participate in the Individual Satyagraha launched by Mahatma Gandhi. Jawaharlal Nehru followed as the second. Gandhi himself initiated the campaign as a form of limited civil disobedience. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership of the Bardoli Satyagraha is well-established. This question tests factual recall of key figures associated with specific movements within the larger context of the Indian Independence Movement. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect statement that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel participated in the Individual Satyagraha. Options (a) and (c) are incomplete, lacking at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the Individual Satyagraha movement and the roles played by its key figures.  It requires precise recall of events and their participants, demonstrating a deeper level of understanding than simple general knowledge of the period.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the historical context.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Action/Association
1. Lala Lajpat Rai             Deportation following Punjab riots
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak       Six years' imprisonment in 1908
3. Aurobindo Ghose           Advocated passive resistance
4. Bipin Chandra Pal          Retirement from active politics post-1907

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were indeed deported following riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and received a six-year prison sentence in 1908. Aurobindo Ghose was a prominent figure among the militant nationalists who advocated passive resistance alongside Swadeshi and Boycott.  The text explicitly mentions Bipin Chandra Pal's eventual retirement from active politics, signifying a shift in the leadership of the movement.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to capture the complete picture of the individuals' roles and actions during this crucial period of the Indian nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian revolutionary movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Group         Significant Event/Leader
1. Abhinava Bharat            V.D. Savarkar's organization
2. Anushilan Samiti          500 branches in Dacca alone
3. Hindustan Republican Association  Kakori Conspiracy Case
4. Yugantar                    Advocated revolutionary terrorism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of revolutionaries.  The Anushilan Samiti is described as having a significant presence in Dacca, with 500 branches.  The Hindustan Republican Association is directly linked to the Kakori conspiracy case, with several members facing imprisonment and execution.  Finally, the Yugantar newspaper is mentioned as advocating revolutionary terrorism.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the key players and events in the early 20th-century Indian revolutionary movement. This question tests the candidate's factual recall and ability to analyze information about various revolutionary groups and their activities.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements (1919-1922), consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                       Role/Action
1. Muhammad Ali Jinnah        Left the Congress due to disagreement with the Non-Cooperation movement
2. Mahatma Gandhi             Led the Non-Cooperation movement
3. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad  Key figure in the Khilafat Committee
4.  Shaukat Ali                 Key figure in the Khilafat Committee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Muhammad Ali Jinnah disagreed with the Non-Cooperation movement's approach and left the Congress.  Mahatma Gandhi is identified as the leader of the Non-Cooperation movement.  Both Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Shaukat Ali are mentioned as key figures within the Khilafat Committee, highlighting their pivotal roles in mobilizing Muslim support for the movement.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as all four pairs are accurately matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, indicating a partial understanding of the leadership and dynamics of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, a significant event in the Indian freedom struggle.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall and analyze the roles of various leaders during this period.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to the aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

   Political Group/Individual    Position/Action
1. C.R. Das                       Leader of the Swarajist Party
2. Motilal Nehru                  Leader of the Swarajist Party
3. C. Rajagopalachari             Leader of the No-Changers
4.  Gandhi                         Initially opposed council entry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The text clearly indicates that C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were key leaders of the Swarajist Party, advocating for participation in legislative councils.  C. Rajagopalachari is identified as a leader of the No-Changers, who opposed council entry and focused on constructive work.  The passage also explicitly mentions Gandhi's initial opposition to the Swarajists' proposal of council entry. Therefore, all four pairs are accurately matched, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, reflecting an incomplete grasp of the factional divisions within the Congress after the Non-Cooperation Movement and the differing strategies adopted by various groups. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the political dynamics within the Indian National Congress during a critical phase of the national movement.



**5. With reference to the Simon Commission and its aftermath, consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Group                 Action/Position
1.  Simon Commission             All members were British
2. Motilal Nehru                  Chaired the committee that drafted the Nehru Report
3.  Nehru Report                  Recommended Dominion Status as the next step
4. Mohammed Ali Jinnah         Proposed the "Fourteen Points"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The passage confirms that the Simon Commission consisted entirely of British members, sparking widespread protests in India.  Motilal Nehru headed the committee responsible for drafting the Nehru Report, a significant document outlining constitutional proposals for India.  The Nehru Report indeed recommended Dominion Status as the next step towards self-government.  Finally, Mohammed Ali Jinnah is correctly linked to the proposal of his "Fourteen Points," which included demands for separate electorates and other provisions for Muslim representation.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer because all four pairs are correctly matched.  The other options are incomplete and demonstrate a limited understanding of the events surrounding the Simon Commission and the subsequent efforts to formulate a common constitutional vision for India.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect historical figures and events.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Leader                      Movement/Organization
1.  Mahatma Gandhi             :   All India Khilafat Committee
2.  Muhammad Ali               :   Khilafat Committee
3.  Abul Kalam Azad            :   All India Khilafat Conference (Delhi, 1919)
4.  Shaukat Ali                 :   Khilafat Committee
5.  Hakim Ajmal Khan          :   All India Khilafat Conference (Delhi, 1919)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi was indeed the president of the All India Khilafat Committee, playing a pivotal role in linking the Khilafat issue with the broader Indian nationalist movement.  Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, known as the Ali brothers, were prominent leaders of the Khilafat Committee, spearheading the Muslim demand for the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate. Abul Kalam Azad and Hakim Ajmal Khan were key figures in the All India Khilafat Conference held in Delhi in November 1919, where a call for the boycott of British goods was made.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes pair 3, which incorrectly links Abul Kalam Azad solely to the 1919 Delhi conference; he was involved in many other Khilafat activities. Options (a) and (b) are too narrow, omitting correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes an inaccurate pairing. The question highlights the interconnectedness of various figures and organizations within the Khilafat movement, testing the candidate's knowledge of the key players and their roles.



**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Decision                   Month/Year
1.  Gandhi announces non-cooperation  :   February 1920
2.  Treaty of Sevres signed           :   May 1920
3.  Allahabad all-party conference    :   June 1920
4.  Nagpur Congress Session          :   December 1920
5.  Chauri Chaura Incident           :  February 1922

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the chronological understanding of key events in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Gandhi's announcement regarding the potential launch of non-cooperation following the unsatisfactory peace terms for Turkey did indeed occur in February 1920. The Treaty of Sevres, which formally dismembered the Ottoman Empire, was signed in May 1920, fueling the Khilafat movement's intensity. The Allahabad all-party conference in June 1920 approved a program of boycott, paving the way for the formal launch of the movement. The Nagpur Congress session in December 1920 formally endorsed the Non-Cooperation program and made significant organizational changes within the Congress.  Finally, the Chauri Chaura incident, a violent clash between protestors and police, happened in February 1922, ultimately leading to Gandhi's withdrawal of the movement.  All pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurately paired events.  This question evaluates the candidate's ability to place key events in their correct temporal sequence within the Non-Cooperation Movement narrative.



**3. With reference to the participants and their roles in the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                      Role/Contribution
1.  Motilal Nehru                 :   Gave up legal practice to participate
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru              :   Led the Awadh Kisan Movement
3.  Vallabhbhai Patel              :   Led the Bardoli Satyagraha
4.  C. Rajagopalachari             :   Gave up legal practice to participate
5.  Rajendra Prasad                :   Gave up legal practice to participate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of individual contributions to the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Motilal Nehru, along with many other prominent lawyers, indeed gave up his lucrative legal practice to participate fully in the movement, demonstrating a commitment to the cause.  Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership of the Bardoli Satyagraha, a significant peasant movement, is a well-documented fact.  Rajendra Prasad also abandoned his legal career to actively participate in the movement.  C. Rajagopalachari similarly gave up his legal practice. However, Jawaharlal Nehru's role was not primarily leading the Awadh Kisan Movement; although he was involved in the broader peasant movement, other leaders held more prominent roles in the Awadh Kisan Movement specifically. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pairing of Jawaharlal Nehru with the Awadh Kisan Movement leadership. Option (c) correctly identifies the accurate pairings, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the movement’s diverse participation. This question assesses the candidate’s ability to differentiate between direct and indirect involvement of key figures in the movement, demanding a deeper understanding than simple factual recall.



**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Group                 Key Figure/Leader
1.  Anushilan Samiti                :   Barindra Kumar Ghosh
2.  Jugantar                           :   Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin)
3.  Abhinav Bharat                   :   V.D. Savarkar
4.  Ghadar Party                      :   Lala Hardayal
5.  Hindustan Republican Association:   Ramprasad Bismil

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of revolutionary organizations and their key leaders during the early 20th century in India.  Barindra Kumar Ghosh was a prominent figure in the Anushilan Samiti, a revolutionary organization active in Bengal.  Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) led the Jugantar group, a significant offshoot of the Anushilan Samiti. V.D. Savarkar was the founder and leader of the Abhinav Bharat, a secret society of revolutionaries in Maharashtra. Lala Hardayal was a key figure in the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary organization with a significant presence among Indian immigrants in North America. Ramprasad Bismil was a founding member of the Hindustan Republican Association, which later evolved into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. All five pairs are correctly matched, therefore option (c) is correct. Other options fail to include all the accurately matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect revolutionary groups with their respective leaders, demonstrating their understanding of the fragmented yet interconnected nature of the revolutionary movement during this period.


**5. With reference to the  Government of India Act 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Act                      Description
1.  Provincial Autonomy                 :   Dyarchy replaced by full provincial autonomy.
2.  Federal Level Executive              :   Governor-General held extensive reserved powers.
3.  All India Federation                :   Never formed due to non-fulfillment of conditions.
4.  Communal Electorates               :   System further extended.
5.  Legislature                          :   Bicameral, with both houses having Indian elected members.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses comprehension of the key features of the Government of India Act 1935. The Act did indeed introduce provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchical system. The Governor-General retained significant reserved powers at the federal level, limiting the extent of self-governance.  The proposed All-India Federation never materialized due to the non-participation of many princely states. The Act also unfortunately perpetuated the system of communal electorates. However, the description of the legislature is partially inaccurate. While it was bicameral,  the upper house (Council of States) had a significant number of nominated members, not solely Indian elected members.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is the only option that correctly reflects this. The other options incorrectly either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the inaccurate pairing regarding the composition of the legislature. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of both the structure and limitations of the 1935 Act, demanding a precise understanding of its provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Deportation/Imprisonment Event       Person Involved
1. Deportation following Punjab riots     :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2. 6 years' imprisonment in 1908         :   Bal Gangadhar Tilak
3. Deportation in December 1908         :   Lala Lajpat Rai
4. Imprisonment in Madras                 :   Bipin Chandra Pal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly mentions Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment for six years in 1908 and the deportation of several Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, in December 1908.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported earlier in 1907 following riots in the Punjab.  Option (c) accurately reflects these events.  Option (a) is incorrect as Gokhale's involvement in the given events is not mentioned in the provided text.  Option (b) is incomplete; while Tilak's imprisonment is correctly matched, it omits the other correct pairing. Option (d) incorrectly includes the pairing involving Bipin Chandra Pal, whose imprisonment in Madras, while potentially true historically, is not detailed in this specific text.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are definitively supported by the given source.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from a larger body of text, crucial skills for UPSC preparation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nationalist Movement Feature        Associated Slogan
1. Swadeshi Movement                     :    "Inquilab Zindabad"
2. Anti-Partition Agitation              :   "Bande Mataram"
3. Home Rule Movement                   :    "Swaraj"
4. Ghadar Movement                     :    "Complete Independence"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly links "Bande Mataram" with the anti-partition movement in Bengal.  The concept of "Swaraj" (self-rule) is centrally associated with the Home Rule Movement.  The slogans "Inquilab Zindabad" and "Complete Independence" are not directly connected to the Swadeshi Movement or the Ghadar Movement in the given text.  While these slogans may be historically associated with broader nationalist sentiments, the provided text lacks the specific linkage to these movements. Option (b) correctly identifies the two pairs with verifiable connections based solely on the provided text. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating the need for precise factual recall and avoiding assumptions based on general knowledge of Indian history.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between direct textual evidence and broader historical context.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person            Political Affiliation/Role
1. Aurobindo Ghose    :   Congress Moderate
2. Dadabhai Naoroji :   President, Indian National Congress (multiple terms)
3. Bipin Chandra Pal  :   Founder, Hindustan Republican Association
4.  Gokhale           :  Prominent Leader, Home Rule League


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that Dadabhai Naoroji served as President of the Indian National Congress on multiple occasions.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Aurobindo Ghose is associated with militant nationalism, not moderate Congress politics.  Bipin Chandra Pal was a prominent figure in militant nationalism but not a founder of the Hindustan Republican Association.  Gokhale was a prominent moderate leader, but the provided text does not establish his direct connection with the Home Rule League. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the information presented in the source. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills in identifying precise roles and affiliations within the complex landscape of Indian nationalism.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors adds to the question's difficulty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Publication         Ideological Stance/Association
1. *India*              :   Advocated Revolutionary Terrorism
2. *Yugantar*           :   Promoted Moderate Nationalism
3. *Sandhya*            :   Published by the East India Association
4.  *The Philosophy of the Bomb*:   Expressed views of HSRA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions *Yugantar* and *Sandhya* as publications that advocated revolutionary terrorism. *The Philosophy of the Bomb* is directly linked to the views of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).  *India*, while a historically significant publication, is not explicitly linked to revolutionary terrorism in this specific text.  The East India Association's connection to *Sandhya* is also not stated in the given source. Option (d) accurately identifies the only two pairs supported by the textual evidence.  Options (a), (b), and (c) present incorrect pairings, illustrating the importance of precise information retrieval and the avoidance of making assumptions based on general knowledge. This question assesses factual recall and analysis, requiring careful reading and interpretation of the provided text.



**5. With reference to the early phases of the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                      Primary Goal/Focus
1.  Landholders’ Society             :   Promoting peasant welfare
2.  Bengal British Indian Society    :   Protecting and promoting general public interests
3.  Bombay Presidency Association   :   Advocating for immediate independence

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the Bengal British Indian Society aimed to protect and promote general public interests. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's focus on economic and administrative reform is also mentioned. The Landholders' Society's primary concern was the advancement of landlord interests, not peasant welfare.  The Bombay Presidency Association's goal of immediate independence is not documented in the given source.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched according to the information provided.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the stated goals of various organizations. The distractors in the options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the early nationalist movement.  The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**6. With reference to the individuals involved in the Indian independence movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                         Significant Contribution/Action
1.  Khudiram Bose                     :   Organized the Abhinava Bharat
2.  V.D. Savarkar                      :   Threw a bomb at a carriage in Muzaffarpur
3.  Shyamji Krishnavarma             :   Led the Dandi March
4.  Mahatma Gandhi                   :   Established centers of revolutionary activity abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of revolutionaries.  The text also indicates that Shyamji Krishnavarma, along with Savarkar and Har Dayal, were prominent leaders of the Ghadar movement who established centers of activity abroad.  The text mentions Khudiram Bose's involvement in throwing a bomb at a carriage in Muzaffarpur.  The Dandi March was led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Therefore, only the pairings for Savarkar and Shyamji Krishnavarma are accurately matched with their actions based on the provided text.  This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail, as it involves distinguishing between individuals and their specific actions within the revolutionary movement. The distractors are designed to test the examinee's knowledge of prominent figures and events. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

5. Ajmal Khan                    : Leader, Swarajists group in the Congress

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Following the arrest of Gandhi in March 1922, a significant division emerged within the Indian National Congress regarding the future course of action.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, along with Ajmal Khan, spearheaded the Swarajist faction, advocating for participation in legislative councils to challenge the colonial government from within.  Conversely, Vallabhbhai Patel and C. Rajagopalachari led the No-Changers, who opposed council entry and favored focusing on constructive work and preparing for future civil disobedience. The formation of the Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party (or Swarajist Party) by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru further solidified this division, showcasing the distinct strategies employed within the nationalist movement. The accuracy of each pairing underscores the key figures and their roles in shaping the political landscape of the time.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the factional divisions within the Congress during this period.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following pairs:**

   Leader/Figure                   Role/Association
1. Lala Lajpat Rai                 : Inspired student movement in Punjab
2. Muhammad Ali                    : Leader, Khilafat Committee
3. Acharya Narendra Dev            : Organizer, National Schools and Colleges
4.  Subhash Chandra Bose          : Principal, National College, Calcutta
5.  Hakim Ajmal Khan              : Acting President, Ahmedabad Congress Session, 1921

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the individuals' roles and associations with the Non-Cooperation Movement. Lala Lajpat Rai's influence on the student movement in Punjab is well-documented, marking an early phase of the movement. Muhammad Ali was a key figure in the Khilafat Committee, highlighting the movement's Hindu-Muslim unity. Acharya Narendra Dev played a crucial role in establishing national schools and colleges as an alternative to government institutions.  Subhash Chandra Bose's leadership as principal of National College, Calcutta, showcases the movement's educational initiatives. Lastly, Hakim Ajmal Khan's role as acting president during the Ahmedabad Congress session of 1921 exemplifies the broader leadership structure of the movement.  The comprehensive accuracy of these pairings underscores a thorough understanding of the movement's key actors and their contributions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, indicating a partial understanding of the movement's leadership and organizational structure.



**3. With reference to the Swarajist and No-Changer factions within the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure               Stance on Council Entry
1.  C.R. Das                       :  Supported council entry
2. Motilal Nehru                    : Opposed council entry
3. Vallabhbhai Patel              : Supported council entry
4.  C. Rajagopalachari             : Opposed council entry
5. M.A. Ansari                     : Supported council entry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the stance of  Vallabhbhai Patel and M.A. Ansari.  The correct answer highlights the core ideological differences between the Swarajists and No-Changers.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were key figures in the Swarajist faction, which advocated for entering legislative councils to obstruct colonial rule from within.  Conversely, Vallabhbhai Patel and C. Rajagopalachari were leading members of the No-Changers, who opposed council entry, emphasizing constructive work and non-cooperation. M.A. Ansari, though less prominent than the others listed, also belonged to the Swarajist camp.  Understanding these differing viewpoints is essential for comprehending the complexities of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1920s.  The incorrect options reflect potential confusion between the two groups and their respective positions on participating in legislative councils.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Movement            Prominent Leader
1. Hindustan Republican Association : Bhagat Singh
2. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association : Chandrashekhar Azad
3.  Forward Bloc                     : Subhas Chandra Bose
4.  Khudai Khidmatgars             : Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan
5.  Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha   : Bhagat Singh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs represent accurate leader-organization pairings. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), had Bhagat Singh as a prominent member and active participant. Chandrashekhar Azad played a pivotal role in reorganizing the HRA into the HSRA, emphasizing socialist ideals. Subhas Chandra Bose founded the Forward Bloc, a political party advocating for complete independence.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as Badshah Khan or Frontier Gandhi, led the Khudai Khidmatgars, a non-violent movement in the Northwest Frontier Province.  Bhagat Singh was also a key figure in establishing the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, an organization focused on youth mobilization and revolutionary activities.  Understanding these associations is crucial for grasping the diverse revolutionary movements within the broader Indian independence struggle. The incorrect options demonstrate an incomplete understanding of the key figures and their respective organizations.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of the Act                      Description
1.  Provincial Autonomy                : Dyarchy replaced by complete provincial autonomy
2. Federal Legislature                   : Bicameral legislature with a Council of States and a Federal Assembly
3.  All-India Federation               :  Federation formed immediately upon passage of the act
4.  Special Responsibilities of the Governor :  Governor had significant powers to intervene in provincial administration.
5.  Communal Electorates              : Separate electorates were introduced or continued for various religious communities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option accurately reflects several key features of the Government of India Act, 1935.  Provincial autonomy replaced the earlier dyarchy system, granting provinces greater self-governance. The Act established a bicameral federal legislature with a Council of States and a Federal Assembly, though this was not fully implemented due to the non-participation of princely states.  The Governor retained significant special responsibilities, allowing them to intervene in provincial matters.  The Act continued the system of communal electorates, a controversial aspect that contributed to the future partition of India.  Option (d) is incorrect because the All-India Federation proposed in the Act was never fully realized due to the non-participation of many princely states. The other options are also incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of the Government of India Act, 1935, requires knowledge of its provisions and their implications for the Indian political landscape.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual/Group                  Action/Movement
1.  Vinoba Bhave                   : First to offer Individual Satyagraha
2.  Rani Gaidinliu                  : Led a Naga rebellion
3.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan       : Led the Khudai Khidmatgars
4.  Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt : Threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly
5.  Surya Sen                       : Led the Chittagong Armoury Raid


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately link individuals or groups to their actions or movements during the Indian independence struggle.  Vinoba Bhave's initiation of Individual Satyagraha marked a significant phase of resistance. Rani Gaidinliu's leadership in the Naga rebellion highlighted the participation of tribal communities in the struggle for freedom. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan's Khudai Khidmatgars, also known as the Red Shirts, represented a powerful non-violent movement. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt's bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly demonstrated the revolutionary strand within the movement. Finally, Surya Sen's Chittagong Armoury Raid showcased the use of armed rebellion as a form of protest. Understanding these various forms of resistance and the key players involved is crucial for a complete picture of the Indian freedom struggle.  Incorrect options highlight a lack of comprehensive knowledge of the diverse forms of resistance and the individuals/groups associated with them.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature/Impact
1. Pitt's India Act, 1784                         : Established the Board of Control
2. Regulating Act, 1773                            : Created a Supreme Court in Calcutta
3. Charter Act, 1833                              : Abolished the Company's trade monopoly with China
4. Indian Councils Act, 1861                      : Introduced portfolio system in the Viceroy's Executive Council

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pitt's India Act of 1784 is correctly paired with the establishment of the Board of Control, a significant step in increasing British government oversight of the East India Company's affairs. The Regulating Act of 1773 is accurately matched with the creation of the Supreme Court in Calcutta, aiming to improve the judicial system in British India.  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 correctly introduced the portfolio system, a precursor to modern cabinet government, within the Viceroy's Executive Council. However, the Charter Act of 1833 did not abolish the Company's trade monopoly with China; that happened later with the Charter Act of 1853.  The 1833 Act did end the Company's monopoly on trade within India, but this is a different aspect. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatched pairing of the Charter Act of 1833.  The question tests factual recall regarding significant legislation in the evolution of British rule in India and its administrative structures. Understanding the nuances of these acts is crucial for analyzing the British impact on Indian governance.


**2. With reference to British Revenue Policies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Revenue System                            Characteristic
1. Permanent Settlement                      :  Revenue fixed at a high rate, leading to zamindari exploitation
2. Ryotwari System                            :  Direct revenue collection from cultivators, often resulting in overassessment
3. Mahalwari System                           :  Revenue settlement with village communities, periodically revised
4. Hastings' System                           :  Land farmed out to contractors, leading to widespread corruption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, did indeed fix revenue at a high rate, often leaving little for the zamindars after paying the British, leading to exploitation of the ryots (peasants).  The Ryotwari System, associated with Thomas Munro, involved direct collection from cultivators, frequently resulting in overassessment due to inaccurate estimations of land productivity. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, involved revenue settlements with village communities, with periodic revisions of the tax amount.  Hastings' Izaredari system, a precursor to other systems, involved contracting out revenue collection, creating opportunities for widespread corruption and oppression. Option (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs. This question tests detailed knowledge of British revenue systems in India, their implementation, and their consequences for agrarian relations.  Understanding these systems is vital for analyzing the economic impact of British rule.


**3. With reference to the British Indian Army, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Policy                           Key Provision/Outcome
1. 1859 Army Commission                      :  Established a one-third European army
2. 1879 Army Commission                      :  Emphasized the policy of "natives against natives"
3. Post-1857 Army Reorganization           :   Indians allowed in commissioned ranks from 1918
4.  Lord Roberts' tenure (1887-1892)      :   Concept of "martial races" and discriminatory recruitment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The 1859 Army Commission, following the 1857 revolt, aimed to restructure the army to prevent future uprisings and significantly increased the proportion of British troops, aiming for a one-third European component. The 1879 Army Commission, continuing this theme, explicitly promoted the policy of using different Indian groups against each other to prevent a united front against the British.  Post-1857 reorganization did indeed lead to the eventual inclusion of Indians in commissioned ranks, though this was a gradual process starting only around 1918. Lord Roberts' tenure as Commander-in-Chief saw the formalization of the "martial races" theory, leading to discriminatory recruitment policies favoring certain communities perceived as more loyal and less prone to rebellion. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing correctly matched pairs. The question tests knowledge of British military policies in India, their rationale, and their impact on Indian society and the military. Understanding these policies is essential for analyzing the military aspect of British rule.



**4. With reference to the Indian Judiciary under British Rule, consider the following pairs:**

   Governor-General/Reform                      Judicial Reform
1. Warren Hastings                             : Established Sadar Diwani and Fauzdari Adalats
2. Lord Cornwallis                              : Abolished Circuit Courts and established a graded system of civil courts
3. Lord William Bentinck                       : Introduced English as the official language in the Supreme Court
4.  Macaulay's Law Commission (1833)        :  Prepared the Indian Penal Code (1860)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Warren Hastings established the Sadar Diwani Adalat (for civil cases) and Sadar Nizamat Adalat (for criminal cases), crucial steps in reforming the judicial system. Lord William Bentinck oversaw the transition to English as the official language in the Supreme Court, reflecting the growing dominance of the English language in administration. Macaulay's Law Commission was instrumental in drafting the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860, a landmark achievement in legal codification. However, Lord Cornwallis's reforms involved establishing, not abolishing, Circuit Courts, and creating a graded system of civil courts.  Option (a) is incorrect as it misses the correct pairing of the Law Commission. Option (b) is incorrect due to the mismatched pairing of Cornwallis. Option (d) is incorrect because of the same reason. This question tests knowledge of the evolution of the judicial system under British rule, focusing on key reforms and their impact on law and administration. Understanding this evolution is essential for comprehending the legal framework of modern India.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Movement and Constitutional Developments, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                 Key Characteristic
1. Government of India Act, 1919               : Introduced dyarchy in provinces
2. Government of India Act, 1935               : Established a Federal Court
3. Indian Councils Act, 1909                    : Introduced separate electorates for Muslims
4. Nehru Report (1928)                         : Advocated for Dominion Status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms) introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance in provinces, as a step towards greater Indian participation. The Government of India Act of 1935 established a Federal Court to handle inter-provincial disputes and interpret the Act.  The Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a controversial move that had long-term consequences. The Nehru Report, a significant document in the Indian national movement, advocated for dominion status within the British Commonwealth as India's constitutional goal. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the knowledge of major constitutional developments during the British Raj and their relationship to the evolving Indian nationalist movement.  Understanding these acts and their impact is crucial for analyzing the path to Indian independence.
