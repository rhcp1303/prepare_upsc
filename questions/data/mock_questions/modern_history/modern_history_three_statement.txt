**1. With reference to the administrative changes after 1858 in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The India Act of 1858 transferred the power to govern India from the East India Company to the British Crown, establishing the Secretary of State for India as the ultimate authority, answerable to the British Parliament.
2.  The Viceroy, while retaining the title of Governor-General, saw a significant reduction in his decision-making power, particularly in policy matters, with the increasing influence of the Secretary of State in London.
3. The Executive Council of the Governor-General, initially comprising five members, expanded to six ordinary members by 1918, excluding the Commander-in-Chief, with the Governor-General retaining the power to overrule any decision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Government of India Act 1858, also known as the Act for the Better Government of India, marked a crucial shift in the governance of India.  It ended the East India Company's rule and vested the authority in the British Crown, represented by the Secretary of State for India.  This Secretary of State, a member of the British Cabinet, became directly responsible to the British Parliament, establishing a more direct and centralized control.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Governor-General retained the title and some administrative functions, the India Act 1858 initiated a gradual shift of power towards London. The improved communication via the submarine cable laid by 1870 further enhanced the Secretary of State's ability to control even the minutest details of Indian administration, effectively diminishing the Viceroy's autonomy in policy matters. This was a continuation of a trend already established by previous acts such as the Regulating Act and Pitt's India Act.

Statement 3 is likewise correct. The Act of 1858 established the Executive Council to advise the Governor-General. This council initially consisted of five members but grew to include six ordinary members, excluding the Commander-in-Chief by 1918.  Importantly, the Governor-General maintained the ultimate authority, possessing the power to override any decision made by the council, thus consolidating power in his hands.


**2. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1861, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act significantly increased the power of the Imperial Legislative Council, transforming it into a powerful legislative body akin to a parliament, with substantial control over the executive branch.
2. The Act introduced a system where the Governor-General could add up to twelve members to his Executive Council, at least half of whom had to be non-officials (Indian or English), thereby increasing Indian representation in the decision-making process.
3. The Act's expansion of the Governor-General's Council for law-making, while including non-official Indian members, did not grant the council substantial power, leaving it largely advisory and subject to the Governor-General's and the Secretary of State's veto power.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did expand the Governor-General's Council for legislative purposes, but it did *not* grant the Imperial Legislative Council substantial power.  It remained primarily an advisory body with limited influence on the executive.  The council lacked control over the budget and could not discuss important matters or financial measures without prior government approval.  The Governor-General retained the power to veto any legislation, and even legislation passed by the council could be disallowed by the Secretary of State in London.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did permit the Governor-General to expand his Executive Council for legislative purposes by adding non-official members (Indian or English).  However, the significance of this addition is limited by the fact that these members had little real influence on policy.  The selection process was also crucial; the Governor-General nominated these members, often choosing from amongst the elite classes, making the representation less truly representative of the Indian population.

Statement 3 accurately summarizes the limitations of the Indian Councils Act of 1861. While the Act aimed to incorporate Indian voices through the inclusion of non-official members, it did not grant the council any significant legislative or executive authority. The Governor-General and the Secretary of State retained ultimate control, rendering the council's role largely advisory and symbolic. The Act represented a minor step towards greater Indian participation but fell far short of granting substantial power.


**3. With reference to the financial decentralization in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Mayo's reforms of 1870 initiated financial decentralization by transferring control of certain services (police, jails, education, etc.) to provincial governments with fixed grants from central revenues, allowing for some flexibility in resource allocation within those services.
2. Lord Lytton's reforms of 1877 significantly expanded financial decentralization by granting provinces control over additional revenue sources (land revenue, excise taxes, etc.), allowing them to raise funds independently.
3.  The financial arrangements introduced under Lord Ripon in 1882 completely devolved financial power to the provinces, eliminating central government control over provincial finances and establishing true provincial autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes Lord Mayo's 1870 reforms.  He initiated a process of financial decentralization by transferring responsibility for specific services to the provinces, accompanied by fixed grants from the central government. This provided a degree of flexibility for provincial governments to allocate resources within the defined areas, marking a first step towards decentralization.  However, it was far from a complete transfer of financial power.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects Lord Lytton's 1877 reforms.  Building upon Mayo's work, Lytton expanded the scope of provincial control over finances. He transferred additional heads of expenditure and revenue sources to the provinces, giving them greater financial autonomy, although central control was still significantly present.  This step increased provincial financial responsibility but didn't mean complete independence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Lord Ripon's 1882 reforms further refined the financial arrangements, they did *not* lead to complete financial devolution or true provincial autonomy.  The central government retained significant control and influence over provincial finances. The system of revenue sharing and the periodic review of financial arrangements demonstrates that the central authority still maintained its overarching power and influence.  The reforms were a step towards greater provincial financial freedom but did not eliminate the central government's supremacy.


**4. With reference to the British policy towards Princely States after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British abandoned their annexation policy following the 1857 revolt, choosing instead to reward the loyalty of princely states that had supported them by guaranteeing their territorial integrity and the right of adoption.
2. The British policy towards Princely States after 1857 involved their complete subordination to British authority, with the British exercising paramountcy, interfering in internal affairs through Residents, and appointing/dismissing officials.
3. The British actively encouraged the growth of popular democratic and nationalist movements within the princely states to foster greater self-governance and reduce their dependence on the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The 1857 Revolt significantly altered British policy towards Princely States. The British recognized the value of maintaining these states as allies and buffers against future unrest. Consequently, the annexation policy was abandoned, and the states were rewarded for their loyalty with assurances regarding territorial integrity and the right to adopt heirs. This strategic shift aimed to consolidate British rule by securing the cooperation of the princely rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the British offered assurances of territorial integrity, this did not translate into genuine autonomy for the princely states. The British maintained strict control through the assertion of paramountcy, a doctrine that allowed them to interfere in the internal affairs of these states. Residents were stationed in these states, wielding significant influence, and the British could appoint and dismiss officials as they saw fit.  This ensured continued British dominance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British did *not* encourage popular democratic and nationalist movements within the princely states.  On the contrary, they actively worked to suppress such movements, viewing them as threats to their control. The British saw the princely rulers as crucial allies and actively worked to maintain their authority and prevent any challenges to their rule from within the states.  This policy was consistent with their overall strategy of maintaining control and suppressing dissent.


**5. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICS, initially established to manage the East India Company's commercial affairs, gradually evolved into a powerful administrative machinery, with its members often influencing policy decisions.
2.  The Charter Act of 1853 ended the East India Company's patronage system, introducing open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ensuring merit-based selection and equal opportunities for Indians and Europeans alike.
3. The ICS, throughout its history, maintained a policy of complete inclusivity, actively recruiting and promoting Indians to the highest ranks, reflecting a commitment to equal opportunity and the gradual transfer of power to Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The ICS, initially focused on the Company's commercial interests, evolved into a highly influential administrative body.  Its members wielded significant power and often played a crucial role in policy formulation.  They developed a reputation for efficiency, integrity, and hard work, although these qualities primarily served British interests and maintained the colonial system.  The ICS became a powerful instrument of British rule.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Charter Act of 1853 did indeed end the Company's patronage system and introduce open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS. However, the claim of "equal opportunities for Indians and Europeans alike" is misleading. While Indians were allowed to take the examination, various barriers, such as the location of the examination in London, the use of English as the medium, and the age limits, significantly hindered Indian participation and limited their access to higher ranks.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The ICS was characterized by a strong policy of exclusion of Indians from higher ranks.  While some Indians did join the service, they were vastly underrepresented in higher positions of power and influence. This deliberate exclusion was a key element in maintaining British control and dominance.  The claim of "complete inclusivity" is a gross misrepresentation of the historical reality.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the evolution of the Indian Civil Services under British rule:**

1.  The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment, ending the Company's patronage system.
2.  Satyendra Nath Tagore was the first Indian to qualify for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) through the open competitive examination held in India.
3.  The Lee Commission (1924) recommended a 50:50 parity between Europeans and Indians in ICS recruitment within 15 years, with simultaneous examinations held in India and England.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Charter Act of 1853 indeed ended the Company's patronage system and introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS.  This marked a significant step towards the Indianization of the civil services, although it was a gradual process and faced considerable hurdles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Satyendra Nath Tagore was indeed the first Indian to qualify for the ICS, the examination was held in England, not India. The examination process was designed to be highly selective and challenging, favoring candidates with access to British education and resources.  The holding of simultaneous examinations in India was a long-standing demand of Indian nationalists, but it was not fully implemented until much later.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The Lee Commission did recommend increasing Indian representation in the ICS, aiming for a 50:50 parity between Europeans and Indians. However, the recommendation for simultaneous examinations in India and England was made earlier and was not a primary focus of the Lee Commission.  The commission’s recommendations, while aiming for increased Indian participation, were still within the framework of maintaining British control and influence over the administration.  The 15-year timeframe was also aspirational and not strictly adhered to.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1858, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, ending the Company's rule.
2.  The Governor-General assumed the title of Viceroy, signifying increased prestige and authority.
3.  The Act established a bicameral legislature in India, granting significant legislative powers to Indian representatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1858 formally transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown. This marked the end of the Company's rule and the beginning of direct rule by the British Crown. The 1857 revolt highlighted the limitations of the Company's rule and the need for greater accountability and control.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor-General was given the title of Viceroy, which enhanced his prestige as the Crown's representative in India.  However, while his prestige increased, the actual concentration of power shifted towards the Secretary of State for India in London, gradually reducing the Viceroy's effective authority over policy-making.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act of 1858 did not establish a bicameral legislature. The legislative process remained largely under the control of the executive branch, with limited representation for Indians.  The creation of a more representative legislature would come later with subsequent acts, such as the Indian Councils Act of 1861. The 1858 act focused primarily on establishing direct Crown rule and addressing the issues raised by the 1857 revolt, rather than on major legislative reforms.


**3. With reference to the evolution of the police system in modern India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Warren Hastings established a unified, centralized All-India Police force in 1775 based on the British model.
2.  The Indian Police Act of 1861, based on the recommendations of the Police Commission of 1860, established a standardized police structure across the provinces.
3.  The Frazer Commission (1902-03) recommended the creation of a Criminal Intelligence Department at the Centre, which later evolved into the primary domestic intelligence agency.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Warren Hastings did take steps to improve law and order, including the establishment of faujdar thanas, he did not establish a unified, centralized All-India Police force. The British approach to policing evolved gradually over time, with significant regional variations and differences in structure and organization.  A truly unified police force under a central authority was never created during the British period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Police Act of 1861, following the recommendations of the Police Commission of 1860, created a more standardized police structure across the various provinces of British India. This included the establishment of uniform ranks and a clearer hierarchy within the police system. However, significant regional variations persisted.

Statement 3 is correct. The Frazer Commission (1902-03) did recommend the creation of a Criminal Intelligence Department at the Centre. This department later evolved into the central domestic intelligence agency, playing a significant role in maintaining British control and suppressing dissent.  The establishment of this centralized intelligence function reflects the British emphasis on surveillance and control.


**4. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, granted proprietary rights to the zamindars over their lands, aiming to create a class of landlord-investors.
2.  The Ryotwari System, primarily implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots).
3.  The Mahalwari System, prevalent in parts of North India, assessed land revenue collectively at the village level (mahal), with the village headman responsible for collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, did grant proprietary rights to the zamindars. The intention was to create a class of landlord-investors who would improve the land and generate increased revenue for the British.  However, this often led to exploitation of the ryots and did not always result in the intended land improvements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari System, primarily implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved the direct assessment and collection of land revenue from individual cultivators (ryots). This system bypassed the intermediary zamindars, leading to a different set of problems regarding overassessment and exploitation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, did assess land revenue collectively at the village level (mahal). The village headman (lambardar) was responsible for collection and distribution, creating a different system of land tenure and revenue collection compared to the Permanent Settlement and Ryotwari System.  However, the system was not always efficient and could lead to its own set of issues regarding accurate assessment and exploitation.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning British administrative policies in India after 1858:**

1. The policy of "divide and rule" was abandoned after the 1857 revolt due to its perceived failure.
2.  The British actively encouraged modern education among Indians to foster a loyal and cooperative populace.
3.  The British government actively supported social reforms such as the abolition of sati and widow remarriage to improve social conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The policy of "divide and rule" was not abandoned after 1857; rather, it became even more pronounced. The British government actively exploited existing social and religious divisions to maintain control and prevent the emergence of a unified nationalist movement.  This strategy was a key element of their approach to governing India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British did encourage modern education, it was not primarily to foster a loyal populace.  Their motives were more complex and included the need for a class of Indians who could serve in subordinate administrative roles and the creation of a market for British goods. The British attitude towards educated Indians shifted over time, from initial encouragement to later suspicion and hostility as nationalism grew.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  After the 1857 revolt, the British government largely withdrew its support for social reforms. This was partly because some social reforms had angered conservative groups, increasing the risk of unrest. The British increasingly sided with conservative elements in Indian society to maintain stability and control.  The earlier support for some reforms was more opportunistic than a genuine commitment to social progress.


**6. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1861, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced a system of direct elections to the Imperial Legislative Council, marking a significant step towards representative government.
2. The Act expanded the Governor-General's Council for legislative purposes, including a limited number of non-official members.
3.  The Act gave the Imperial Legislative Council significant control over the budget and the executive branch of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did *not* introduce a system of direct elections.  The non-official members were nominated, not elected, representing a limited and carefully selected segment of Indian society.  The Act was a small step towards greater Indian participation in governance, but it fell far short of establishing a truly representative system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did expand the Governor-General's Council for legislative purposes, including a limited number of non-official members (Indians and British). This was a symbolic move towards greater Indian participation, though the powers of the council remained severely limited.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Imperial Legislative Council established by the Act had virtually no control over the budget or the executive branch. It was largely an advisory body with limited power to influence government policy or actions.  The council's main function was to provide a veneer of legitimacy to the government's decisions, rather than to provide meaningful checks and balances.


**7. With reference to the British policy towards Princely States in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy of annexation of princely states was completely abandoned after the 1857 revolt.
2. The British government consistently upheld the complete internal sovereignty of princely states, avoiding interference in their internal affairs.
3. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, provided princely states with significant political power in the governance of British India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the overt policy of annexation decreased after 1857, the British continued to exert significant influence and control over princely states through various means, including interference in succession matters and the deployment of Residents.  The policy shift was more tactical than a complete abandonment of control.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The British government did not uphold the complete internal sovereignty of princely states. They frequently interfered in internal affairs through Residents, influencing policies and even removing rulers deemed to be problematic.  The doctrine of paramountcy asserted British supremacy and the right to intervene whenever deemed necessary.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, was primarily a consultative body. It provided a platform for princely states to interact with the British government, but it did not grant them significant political power in the governance of British India.  The chamber served largely as a tool for the British to manage and control the princely states, rather than to empower them.


**1. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1858, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act transferred the power to govern India from the East India Company to the British Crown, establishing the Secretary of State for India as the ultimate authority, responsible to the British Parliament.
2.  The Governor-General of India assumed the title of Viceroy, signifying increased prestige but not necessarily authority, as final decision-making power increasingly resided with the Secretary of State in London.
3.  The Act mandated the establishment of an Executive Council to assist the Viceroy, with members heading different departments and acting as official advisors, though the Viceroy retained the power to overrule council decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key provisions of the Government of India Act, 1858.  The Act formally ended the East India Company's rule and vested governing power in the British Crown, represented by the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet directly accountable to Parliament. This marked a significant shift in authority, moving ultimate control from the Company's directors to the British government. While the Governor-General retained the title and functions of administering India as Viceroy, the Act initiated a trend towards increased subordination to the Secretary of State in London regarding both policy formulation and execution. The establishment of the Executive Council was a crucial administrative reform, creating a system resembling a cabinet structure, where departmental heads advised the Viceroy. However, the Viceroy retained the ultimate authority to override council decisions, highlighting the centralized nature of the colonial administration.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial aspects of the Act's impact on the structure and functioning of the Indian government.


**2. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1861, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established the Imperial Legislative Council as a powerful, independent legislative body, similar to a parliament, capable of enacting laws with minimal executive interference.
2.  The Act introduced a system of portfolio or departmental system in the Executive Council, enhancing the Viceroy's authority over his council by replacing corporate functioning.
3. The Act expanded the Governor-General's Executive Council, including non-official members (Indian or English), primarily to provide a platform for Indian views and prevent future uprisings, although these members were nominated and not elected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Imperial Legislative Council established by the 1861 Act was far from an independent legislative body. It remained largely advisory, with limited powers and subject to significant executive control.  The Governor-General's approval was necessary for any bill to become law, and even then, the Secretary of State in London could disallow legislation. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Act did expand the Executive Council, it did not introduce a portfolio system to enhance the Viceroy's authority. The portfolio system was a later development.  Statement 3 correctly reflects a key aspect of the Act's impact. The inclusion of non-official members, though nominated, aimed to incorporate Indian perspectives and address concerns raised by the 1857 Revolt. However, their limited number and lack of electoral representation meant they had minimal influence on policy. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include statements that misrepresent the actual power dynamics and legislative structure established by the 1861 Act.


**3. With reference to financial decentralisation in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Mayo's financial reforms of 1870 completely transferred financial control to the provincial governments, granting them full autonomy in managing their budgets.
2. Lord Lytton's reforms of 1877 significantly increased provincial control over expenditure by transferring certain revenue heads and allowing provinces a fixed share of income from specific sources.
3.  The financial arrangements established in 1882 under Lord Ripon resulted in a complete separation of central and provincial finances, ending all central control over provincial expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. Lord Mayo's 1870 reforms were a step towards decentralization, but they didn't grant provinces complete financial autonomy.  Provincial governments received fixed grants for specific services but remained under considerable central control. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The 1882 reforms under Lord Ripon further decentralized finances but didn't lead to a complete separation of central and provincial finances.  Revenue sources were categorized, but central control persisted, and the central government retained significant influence over overall financial management.  Only statement 2 is accurate. Lord Lytton's 1877 reforms transferred specific expenditure heads to the provinces and provided them with a share of income from certain sources, increasing their control over their budgets.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include statements that overstate the extent of financial autonomy granted to provincial governments during this period.  The process of financial decentralization was gradual and incomplete, with the central government retaining ultimate control.


**4. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Cornwallis's reforms completely eradicated corruption within the ICS by implementing strict rules against private trade and raising salaries to eliminate the need for bribery.
2.  The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the East India Company's patronage system and ensuring merit-based selection.
3.  The ICS remained exclusively a European institution throughout British rule, with Indians completely excluded from higher positions due to perceived incompetence and untrustworthiness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cornwallis's reforms aimed to curb corruption by raising salaries and enforcing rules against private trade, they didn't entirely eliminate it. Corruption remained a persistent problem within the ICS. Statement 3 is also incorrect. While Indians faced significant barriers to entry into higher positions within the ICS, they were not entirely excluded. Satyendranath Tagore became the first Indian to qualify for the ICS in 1863, although the system remained heavily biased against Indian participation. Only statement 2 is entirely correct. The Charter Act of 1853 was a watershed moment, replacing the Company's patronage system with open competitive examinations for ICS recruitment, although the examinations were held in England and favored British candidates. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include statements that oversimplify or misrepresent the complex realities of corruption and Indian participation within the ICS during British rule.


**5. With reference to the British policy towards princely states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy of annexation, actively pursued before 1857, was completely abandoned after the Revolt of 1857, with no further annexations occurring thereafter.
2.  The British government's interference in the internal affairs of princely states was limited to matters of succession and external relations, with internal administration remaining solely under the control of the rulers.
3. The British Crown's assumption of paramountcy over princely states in 1858 established the Crown as the unquestioned ruler of all India, implying the complete subordination of princely states to British authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the policy of annexation was significantly curtailed after 1857 due to the changed political context and the recognition of princely states' loyalty, it was not completely abandoned. The British government still intervened in princely affairs and even deposed rulers. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The British government's interference in princely states extended far beyond succession and external relations. British Residents played a significant role in the internal administration, influencing policy and even appointing and dismissing officials.  Statement 3 accurately reflects a key aspect of the British policy shift after 1858. The Crown's assertion of paramountcy solidified its position as the supreme authority over all of India, including the princely states, which were now formally subordinated to British rule.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include statements that misrepresent the extent of British interference in the internal affairs of princely states and the nature of paramountcy. The British maintained significant control over the princely states while using them as a political tool.


**6. With reference to the British Indian Army, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the 1857 Revolt, the British Indian Army was reorganized to increase the proportion of Indian soldiers, reflecting a policy of greater trust and inclusion of Indian personnel in military leadership roles.
2. The British maintained a strict monopoly over key military branches such as artillery and, later, tanks and armoured corps, ensuring that crucial military technologies and positions remained exclusively in European hands.
3.  The British consciously employed a policy of "divide and rule" within the Indian Army, fostering divisions based on caste, religion, and region to prevent unified opposition to British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The reorganization of the British Indian Army after 1857 involved a reduction in the proportion of Indian soldiers and a strengthening of the European contingent to prevent future revolts.  Indian soldiers were not given greater inclusion in military leadership roles. Statement 3 accurately describes a key aspect of the British military strategy. By playing upon existing social divisions, the British aimed to weaken potential unified resistance from within the Indian Army. Only statement 2 is correct. The British retained control of key military technologies and positions, ensuring that crucial aspects of military power remained firmly in European hands. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include a statement that misrepresents the post-1857 reorganization of the British Indian Army and its impact on the balance of power between Indian and European personnel. The British strategy was one of maintaining, and even strengthening, their control over the military.


**7. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, resulted in widespread prosperity for the peasantry by granting them secure land ownership rights and reducing their tax burden.
2.  The Ryotwari system, implemented in parts of Madras and Bombay presidencies, aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries and maximizing government revenue.
3.  The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, involved revenue settlements with entire village communities, promoting collective responsibility for tax collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, while granting proprietary rights to zamindars, did not lead to widespread prosperity for the peasantry. It often resulted in increased exploitation by zamindars, who extracted high rents from tenants.  Statement 1 misrepresents the outcome of the Permanent Settlement. Statement 1 is also inaccurate in its assertion that the tax burden was reduced.  Statement 1 is also incorrect.  Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate.  Statement 1 is also inaccurate.  Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate.


Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Ryotwari system aimed at direct revenue collection from cultivators, while the Mahalwari system involved settlements with village communities. Both systems, however, had significant drawbacks, often resulting in high tax burdens and exploitation of cultivators. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include a statement that misrepresents the impact of the Permanent Settlement on the peasantry. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming to stabilize revenue collection, often resulted in increased exploitation and impoverishment of the peasantry.


**8. With reference to local self-government under British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 established fully elected local bodies with significant powers and autonomy, marking a major step towards genuine local self-government.
2. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) recommended increased provincial control over local bodies, arguing that greater centralization was necessary for efficiency.
3.  The Government of India Act, 1919, made local self-government a 'transferred' subject under dyarchy, granting Indian ministers some control over local bodies but limiting their effectiveness due to financial constraints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 was a significant step towards local self-government, but it didn't establish fully elected and autonomous local bodies.  Official control remained substantial, and elected members were often in a minority. Statement 1 overstates the extent of decentralization achieved under Ripon's reforms. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate. Statement 1 is also inaccurate.


Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) did recommend increased provincial control, and the Government of India Act, 1919, did make local self-government a 'transferred' subject under dyarchy, but this was limited by financial constraints as finance remained a 'reserved' subject. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include a statement that overstates the extent of decentralization and autonomy achieved under Lord Ripon's reforms.  The reality was a more nuanced and gradual process of devolution of power, with significant limitations persisting.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British abandoned their earlier policy of supporting social reformers after the 1857 Revolt, aligning themselves with conservative elements.
2.  The British consistently prioritized expenditure on social services like education and sanitation over military spending.
3. The first Indian Factory Act, enacted in 1881, primarily addressed the concerns of British textile manufacturers regarding cheap Indian labor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Post-1857, the British shifted their approach, fearing that social reforms, like the abolition of Sati, had contributed to the revolt.  They consequently curtailed support for reform movements and instead fostered alliances with conservative social groups to bolster their own authority. This is a crucial aspect of understanding the British Raj's complex relationship with Indian society and its impact on social change.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The British Raj consistently prioritized military expenditure and administrative costs over social services.  The text explicitly highlights the disproportionate allocation of funds, with a minuscule fraction dedicated to education, health, and sanitation compared to the substantial investment in the army and administration. This reflects the colonial power's primary focus on maintaining control and suppressing dissent rather than promoting social welfare.

Statement 3 is correct. While the 1881 Factory Act did address child labor, a significant concern, it was also partly driven by pressure from British textile manufacturers. They feared competition from Indian manufacturers employing cheaper, unregulated labor. This highlights the economic interests that shaped British legislation in India, even when ostensibly addressing social issues.  The act was not solely a humanitarian measure but also a tool to protect British industrial interests.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in southern India, aimed to collect land revenue directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries.
2. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, granted zamindars heritable and transferable rights over their land in perpetuity.
3. The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of northern India, involved revenue settlement with village communities or groups of villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of British land revenue systems in India.  The Ryotwari system (Statement 1) indeed aimed for direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, eliminating the intermediary role of zamindars, though in practice, this often led to its own set of exploitative outcomes.

The Permanent Settlement (Statement 2), a landmark policy under Lord Cornwallis, did grant zamindars significant proprietary rights, including heritability and transferability, creating a class of powerful landowners who became crucial supporters of British rule. However, the system's rigid revenue demands and the 'sunset clause' often led to the dispossession of many zamindars.

The Mahalwari system (Statement 3) correctly describes the revenue settlement with village communities or groups of villages (Mahals), a different approach compared to the individual focus of Ryotwari or the zamindar-centric Permanent Settlement. This system, too, had its flaws, often leading to over-assessment and hardship for cultivators.  Understanding these different revenue systems is crucial for grasping the transformation of agrarian relations and the economic exploitation under British rule.


**3. With reference to British attitudes towards various groups in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British utilized Indian princes as a counterbalance against the growing nationalist movement, fostering a policy of "divide and rule."
2. The British consistently maintained a policy of hostility towards educated Indians, viewing them as a threat to their authority.
3.  The British consistently supported the Zamindars and Landlords, viewing them as natural leaders of the Indian people and integral to the stability of British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The British actively employed a strategy of "divide and rule," utilizing the existing power structures and rivalries within Indian society.  They consciously cultivated alliances with princely states, providing them with support and protection, thereby using them as a buffer against the growing nationalist movement. This policy strategically weakened the potential for a unified national resistance.

Statement 2 is correct. The British attitude towards educated Indians was indeed one of suspicion and hostility, particularly as the nationalist movement gained momentum.  Educated Indians were perceived as a potential threat to British authority due to their capacity for critical analysis and organization.  The British response often involved repression, censorship, and restrictions on political activity.

Statement 3 is correct. The British actively sought alliances with the Zamindars and Landlords, recognizing their traditional influence and power.  By supporting their interests and privileges, the British aimed to create a loyalist class that would counterbalance the influence of the nationalist intelligentsia.  This policy effectively secured the support of a powerful segment of Indian society, which helped maintain British rule.  The restoration of lands to Talukdars of Avadh serves as a prime example.


**4. With reference to the British impact on Indian social services and labor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The miserable conditions of workers in 19th-century Indian factories and plantations prompted the British government to introduce comprehensive and effective labor legislation.
2.  The British government's expenditure on social services like education, sanitation, and public health was significantly higher than its expenditure on the army.
3. The 1891 Indian Factories Act regulated working hours for women but left working hours for men unregulated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British government's response to the appalling working conditions in factories and plantations was far from comprehensive or effective.  While some legislation was introduced, it was often inadequate and poorly enforced, failing to significantly improve the lives of workers. The legislation was also often influenced by the economic concerns of British industrialists rather than purely humanitarian considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British government's spending on the army and administration vastly overshadowed its allocation to social services. The text explicitly highlights the disproportionate funding, illustrating the colonial priorities of maintaining control and power over social welfare.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1891 Indian Factories Act did indeed regulate working hours for women, limiting them to 11 hours per day, while leaving the working hours for men unregulated. This selective approach reveals the limitations and inconsistencies of the British government’s efforts to address labor issues.  The act was a step, but a limited one, in improving labor conditions.


**5. With reference to British policies regarding the press and princely states, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted by Lord Lytton, aimed to restrict the freedom of the Indian-language press.
2. The British consistently maintained a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of princely states throughout the 19th century.
3. The Chamber of Princes was established in 1921 to provide a platform for princely states to discuss matters of common interest under British guidance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, implemented during Lord Lytton's viceroyalty, was a direct attempt to curb the growing influence of the Indian-language press, which was increasingly critical of British policies and supportive of nationalist sentiments. This act exemplifies the British government's efforts to control information and suppress dissent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British policy towards princely states involved a complex interplay of control and manipulation. While the British initially avoided outright annexation, they gradually exerted increasing influence over the internal affairs of princely states, particularly after the 1857 Revolt.  This was done through the use of political agents and the doctrine of paramountcy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, served as a forum for princely rulers to interact and deliberate on matters of common concern under the watchful eye of the British government.  This institution further solidified British control over the princely states and ensured their continued cooperation within the colonial framework.  It also served as a means to co-opt the princes against the growing nationalist movement.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of British rule in India.  Each question follows the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British adopted blatantly reactionary policies after 1857, ostensibly because Indians were deemed unfit for self-governance.
2. The "divide and rule" policy primarily involved pitting Hindus against Muslims, ignoring other societal divisions.
3.  The British actively opposed all forms of modern education in India from 1885 onwards, viewing it as a direct challenge to their authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Post-1857, the British administration shifted towards overtly reactionary policies, justifying their continued presence in India by claiming Indians lacked the capacity for self-rule. This marked a departure from their earlier, albeit limited, attempts at modernization.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the British did exploit Hindu-Muslim differences significantly, their "divide and rule" strategy was far more nuanced and comprehensive. They manipulated existing caste, regional, and class divisions to prevent the emergence of a unified national movement.  The statement oversimplifies a complex policy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the British became increasingly hostile towards the emerging nationalist leadership associated with modern education after the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885, they did not uniformly oppose *all* forms of modern education.  Their opposition was selective and targeted towards those they perceived as threats to their rule.  The British continued to support certain educational institutions and initiatives that served their colonial interests.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars full proprietary rights over their lands.
2. The Ryotwari System, implemented across vast swathes of southern and western India, directly taxed individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries.
3. The Mahalwari System, prevalent in northern India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities, with individual cultivators paying their share.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Permanent Settlement vested zamindars with significant proprietary rights, although it was not absolute and had inherent limitations, such as the "sunset clause."  The statement accurately reflects the core principle of the system.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. The Ryotwari system aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators, thereby minimizing the role of intermediaries. However, in practice, complexities arose, and many cultivators were effectively reduced to tenants under various circumstances.  The statement captures the intended structure of the system.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahalwari system assessed revenue at the village or group of villages level ('mahal'), with the village community or headman responsible for collection and distribution of the tax burden. Individual cultivators were the ultimate tax payers. The statement is a fair representation of the system.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs, but this changed after 1813.
2. The British consistently supported social reforms in India, viewing them as a means to modernize and improve Indian society.
3. Christian missionaries played a significant role in promoting Westernization and the spread of Christianity, sometimes aligning with both conservative and radical British administrators.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Before 1813, the British largely followed a policy of non-interference in Indian social and cultural life. However, the rise of industrial capitalism, intellectual and political changes in Europe, and the activities of Christian missionaries led to a shift in this policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some British administrators and intellectuals favored certain social reforms, the British government's overall stance was inconsistent.  Their support for reforms was often conditional and strategically motivated, often wavering based on political expediency and the potential backlash from conservative elements within Indian society.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate view.

Statement 3 is correct. Christian missionaries actively promoted Westernization and Christianity in India. Their strategies involved aligning with both conservative and radical factions within the British administration depending on the specific context and goals.  This complex relationship accurately portrays the missionary role.


**4. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. British foreign policy in India was primarily driven by the need to protect the Indian empire and expand British economic interests in Asia and Africa.
2. The British consistently pursued peaceful relations with neighboring countries, avoiding military conflicts whenever possible.
3. The costs of British foreign policy, including wars and military expenditures, were primarily borne by the Indian taxpayer.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. British foreign policy in India was fundamentally shaped by imperial interests. The need to secure the Indian empire and expand British commercial and economic influence in Asia and Africa greatly influenced its foreign relations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British frequently engaged in military conflicts with neighboring countries to expand their territorial control, secure their frontiers, and counter rival European powers.  The statement contradicts historical realities.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the British benefited economically from their Indian empire, the financial burden of wars and military expenditures was largely shouldered by the Indian populace through taxation.  The statement accurately reflects the economic reality of colonial rule.


**5. With reference to the British labor legislation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The first Indian Factory Act of 1881 primarily addressed child labor, prohibiting employment of children under 7 and restricting working hours for older children.
2. The 1891 Factory Act significantly improved working conditions for women in factories, including regulating their working hours and providing weekly holidays.
3. British-owned tea and coffee plantations were subject to the same labor regulations as factories, ensuring fair treatment and reasonable working conditions for plantation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1881 Factory Act focused on child labor, setting minimum age limits and regulating working hours for children employed in factories.  The statement accurately reflects the act's primary focus.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The 1891 Act did regulate women's working hours and introduce weekly holidays, but the conditions for women in factories remained far from ideal.  The statement understates the continued exploitation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The factory acts of 1881 and 1891 did *not* apply to British-owned tea and coffee plantations. Plantation workers faced significantly worse conditions, with little to no regulation and rampant exploitation.  The statement is factually inaccurate.


**1. With reference to Gandhi's early Satyagraha campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Champaran Satyagraha primarily addressed the grievances of indigo farmers against exploitative European planters.
2.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike saw Gandhi employing a fast-unto-death to secure a wage increase for mill workers, exceeding 50%.
3. The Khaira peasant struggle involved Gandhi's direct intervention to address land revenue issues during crop failure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha (1917) was indeed Gandhi's first major Satyagraha campaign in India, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers exploited by British planters who forced them into unfavorable contracts.  Gandhi's investigation and defiance of the authorities led to the reduction of the peasants' burdens.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi did indeed mediate the Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) and employed a fast-unto-death, the mill owners agreed to a 35% wage increase, not exceeding 50%.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  The statement uses a plausible distractor by exaggerating the wage increase.

Statement 3 is correct.  Gandhi supported the Khaira peasants in Gujarat who faced land revenue demands despite crop failures. This further illustrates Gandhi's commitment to addressing the concerns of rural India and his early engagement with agrarian issues.  The involvement of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in this struggle also reinforces its significance within the broader context of the Indian nationalist movement.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the details of the Ahmedabad Mill Strike or fail to incorporate the accurate facts about Gandhi's involvement in the Khaira peasant struggle.


**2. With reference to the Rowlatt Act and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, authorizing the government to imprison individuals without trial for up to two years.
2.  Gandhi's Satyagraha Sabha actively promoted civil disobedience against the Rowlatt Act, marking a shift towards direct political action.
3. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in response to the Satyagraha Sabha's peaceful protest against the Rowlatt Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act of 1919 was indeed a controversial piece of legislation that allowed for detention without trial, fueling widespread discontent and resistance.  It represented a significant curtailment of civil liberties and highlighted the increasingly repressive nature of British rule.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi's Satyagraha Sabha was instrumental in organizing the non-violent resistance against the Rowlatt Act. This marked a crucial turning point in the Indian nationalist movement, shifting from primarily constitutional methods to direct action and civil disobedience.  The Sabha's activities underscore Gandhi's growing influence and the adoption of Satyagraha as a potent tool for political mobilization.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in Amritsar in 1919, it was a response to broader protests and demonstrations against the Rowlatt Act and other grievances, not specifically against the Satyagraha Sabha's organized campaign. The massacre, a brutal act of state violence, was a turning point in the movement, but its immediate cause was more complex than solely the Satyagraha Sabha's activities.  The other options are incorrect because they either fail to accurately reflect the passage of the Rowlatt Act or misrepresent the relationship between the Satyagraha Sabha and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.



**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following statements:**

1. The movement’s initial phase involved boycotting British institutions like schools, colleges, and courts, but excluded the legislative councils.
2.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the post-World War I treatment of Turkey, played a significant role in uniting Hindus and Muslims within the movement.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the immediate suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial phase of the Non-Cooperation Movement *did* include a boycott of legislative councils.  While there were differences of opinion among Congress leaders regarding this aspect, the final program adopted by the Congress at its Nagpur session in December 1920 included the boycott of councils as part of the non-cooperation strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Khilafat issue, relating to the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I, served as a powerful unifying factor, bringing together Hindu and Muslim nationalists in a shared struggle against British imperialism.  This inter-religious cooperation was a significant feature of the movement's early success.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the death of policemen, prompted Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement in February 1922.  Gandhi's decision, though controversial among some nationalist leaders, underscored his commitment to non-violent methods.  He believed that the movement's effectiveness depended on maintaining strict adherence to non-violence. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scope of the initial boycott or incorrectly characterize the immediate consequences of the Chauri Chaura incident.


**4. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dandi March, led by Gandhi, directly challenged the British salt tax and symbolized the broader struggle against colonial rule.
2. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the immediate and complete grant of Indian independence.
3.  The movement saw significant participation from diverse groups, including women, students, peasants, and some sections of the Muslim community, but lacked substantial labor participation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dandi March, a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt monopoly and tax, was a pivotal moment in the Civil Disobedience Movement. It galvanized the nation and triggered widespread civil disobedience across India. The march's success in capturing public imagination and sparking widespread participation highlights Gandhi's masterful use of symbolic acts to mobilize mass support.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact (1931) did *not* result in Indian independence.  It was a temporary truce that led to the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and Gandhi's participation in the Second Round Table Conference.  The pact, while achieving some concessions, did not address the fundamental issue of Indian self-rule.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed significant participation from diverse social groups. Women, students, peasants, and segments of the Muslim community actively participated in various forms of protest, such as salt satyagraha, boycotts, and demonstrations. However, labor participation was relatively less pronounced compared to other segments of society.  This highlights the complex dynamics of social mobilization during the movement and the varying levels of engagement from different social classes. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the outcome of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact or fail to acknowledge the nuances of social participation within the movement.




**5. With reference to the events leading up to and including the Quit India Movement (1942), consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission, aimed at securing India's cooperation in World War II, failed to reach a consensus due to disagreements over the transfer of power.
2. The Quit India Resolution, passed by the All India Congress Committee, demanded the immediate end of British rule in India.
3. The launch of the Quit India Movement was followed by the immediate and unconditional grant of Indian independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cripps Mission (1942), while attempting to secure Indian support for the Allied war effort, ultimately failed due to irreconcilable differences between the British government and the Indian National Congress regarding the timing and nature of the transfer of power.  The mission's failure exacerbated existing tensions and intensified demands for immediate independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Resolution, passed in August 1942, unequivocally demanded the immediate end of British rule in India.  This marked a significant escalation in the struggle for independence, signifying the Congress's unwavering commitment to self-rule. The resolution's forceful language and the call for mass action underscore the growing impatience with British promises and the desire for decisive action.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement, launched after the passage of the Quit India Resolution, did *not* lead to the immediate grant of independence.  The movement was met with severe repression by the British authorities, resulting in widespread arrests and violence.  India's independence was achieved only after several more years of struggle and significant geopolitical shifts. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the outcome of the Cripps Mission or incorrectly link the Quit India Movement to the immediate achievement of independence.  The question highlights the need for accurate recall of historical events and their outcomes.


**6. With reference to the post-World War II developments in India's struggle for independence, consider the following statements:**

1. The trial of INA officers, initially perceived as traitors, became a rallying point for the Indian nationalist movement.
2. The changing global power dynamics after World War II, with the emergence of the US and USSR as superpowers, significantly influenced Britain's decision to grant independence.
3. Subhas Chandra Bose's formation of the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) had no impact on the British decision to eventually grant India independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The trial of INA officers, who had fought alongside the Axis powers, was initially presented by the British as a case of treason. However, the widespread popular support for the INA officers, who were seen as national heroes, transformed the trial into a major rallying point for the nationalist movement.  The public outcry and demonstrations demanding their release significantly strengthened the movement's momentum.

Statement 2 is correct. The end of World War II drastically altered the global power balance. The emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers significantly weakened Britain's position and ability to maintain its empire.  Both superpowers expressed support for Indian independence, creating pressure on Britain to concede. This international context played a crucial role in Britain's eventual decision to grant independence to India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The formation of the INA by Subhas Chandra Bose, though ultimately unsuccessful in achieving its military objectives, had a significant psychological impact. It demonstrated the potential for armed resistance against British rule and inspired nationalist sentiments within the Indian army itself.  This erosion of loyalty within the British Indian Army contributed to Britain's weakening position and hastened the process of decolonization.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of the INA trial or fail to recognize the combined influence of global power shifts and the INA on Britain's decision-making.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in India post-1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British pursued a policy of restoring confiscated lands to Talukdars of Awadh to cultivate alliances with reactionary social groups.
2.  The British actively supported social reforms post-1857, believing such reforms would strengthen their rule.
3.  The British significantly increased expenditure on social services like education and sanitation after the 1857 revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Post-1857, the British adopted a reactionary approach, seeking alliances with conservative elements like the Talukdars of Awadh.  Restoring their lands was a key strategy to counter the nationalist movement and strengthen their support base.  This is a clear example of the "divide and rule" policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British did *not* actively support social reforms after 1857. They believed that their previous support for reforms like the abolition of Sati had contributed to the 1857 revolt.  Consequently, they shifted to supporting orthodox sections of society, thereby hindering social reform movements.  This demonstrates a deliberate policy shift to maintain control rather than promote social progress.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British did *not* increase spending on social services after 1857.  Instead, a disproportionately large portion of the budget continued to be allocated to the military and civil administration, leaving social services severely underfunded. This neglect of social services is a significant aspect of British colonial rule in India and had lasting negative consequences.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in the Madras Presidency, involved revenue collection directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries.
2.  The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of Northern India, assessed revenue based on the collective produce of a village or group of villages.
3.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars absolute ownership of land, leading to significant improvements in agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ryotwari system directly taxed individual cultivators, eliminating the role of intermediaries like zamindars. While aiming for efficiency in revenue collection, it often led to over-assessment and exploitation of peasants.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mahalwari system assessed revenue collectively from a village or group of villages (mahal).  The village community was nominally considered the owner, but the system also involved individual assessments and often resulted in high revenue demands and exploitation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Permanent Settlement, while granting zamindars proprietary rights, did *not* lead to significant improvements in agricultural practices. Zamindars primarily focused on rent extraction rather than investment in land improvement. This led to issues like absentee landlordism and subinfeudation, harming the peasantry.


**3. With reference to British labour legislations in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Factory Act of 1881 primarily addressed the issue of child labour, prohibiting the employment of children below 7 years of age.
2. The Indian Factory Act of 1891 reduced the maximum working hours for women to 7 hours per day and mandated a weekly holiday for all workers.
3.  British-owned tea and coffee plantations were subject to the same labour regulations as factories under the Factory Acts of 1881 and 1891.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1881 Act did address child labour, but the age limit was set at 7, not below 7.  Children between 7 and 12 were restricted to 9 hours of work per day. This highlights the initial, limited scope of early labour legislation in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 1891 Act reduced the maximum working hours for children to 7 hours, but for women, it was 11 hours, not 7.  A weekly holiday was introduced, but the hours for men remained unregulated. This shows the uneven and inadequate nature of the legislation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Factory Acts of 1881 and 1891 did *not* apply to British-owned tea and coffee plantations. These plantations were notorious for harsh labor conditions and exploitation. The government actively supported the planters by passing laws that made it difficult for laborers to break contracts, effectively treating them as bonded labor.  This contrasts sharply with the limited protections offered by the Factory Acts.


**4. With reference to British policies towards the Indian press, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Metcalfe lifted restrictions on the Indian press in 1835, leading to a period of relative freedom.
2. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted by Lord Lytton, imposed stringent restrictions on the Indian language press.
3. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was permanently retained due to its effectiveness in controlling nationalist sentiments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Metcalfe's removal of press restrictions in 1835 is a significant event, showcasing a period of relative freedom for the Indian press before the rise of nationalist sentiments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted under Lord Lytton's viceroyalty, is a key example of British attempts to curb the growing influence of the nationalist press.  It targeted vernacular publications, reflecting a specific strategy to control public opinion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was *not* permanently retained.  It faced significant public protest and was repealed in 1882, highlighting the limitations of repressive measures against a growing nationalist movement.


**5. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially followed a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs, but this changed after 1813.
2.  The rise of industrial capitalism, intellectual revolutions, and the French Revolution significantly influenced British policies towards India.
3. The British consistently supported social reforms in India, viewing them as a means to improve the lives of the Indian people.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference, but this changed significantly after 1813. This shift was influenced by various factors, including the emergence of new ideas and interests in Britain, the rise of missionary activity, and the growing awareness of the need to transform Indian society to serve British economic interests.

Statement 2 is correct.  The major transformations in Europe—the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution—had a profound impact on British attitudes and policies toward India.  These changes led to diverse schools of thought within the British administration, ranging from conservative to radical approaches to governance and social reform.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British did *not* consistently support social reforms. Their support fluctuated depending on political expediency and the perceived threat to their rule.  While they initially supported some reforms, they later withdrew support as they perceived reforms as destabilizing elements.  This pragmatic approach reflects the self-serving nature of British colonial rule.


**6. With reference to the British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British foreign policy in India was primarily driven by the interests of British imperialism, often leading to conflicts with neighboring countries.
2.  The British aimed to establish natural geographical frontiers for India to ensure internal cohesion and defense.
3.  The British consistently sought to foster friendly relations with other European powers in Asia, avoiding any conflicts of interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. British foreign policy in India was undeniably shaped by imperial interests. The pursuit of these interests frequently resulted in conflicts with neighboring countries, reflecting a pattern of expansionism and control.

Statement 2 is correct.  The British did seek to establish natural geographical frontiers for India.  This was partly motivated by a desire for internal security and defense but also served their broader imperial objectives.  This strategy highlights the intertwining of internal and external dimensions of British policy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British did *not* consistently seek friendly relations with other European powers.  Their imperial ambitions often clashed with those of other European powers, leading to conflicts and competition for influence and resources in Asia and Africa. This competitive aspect of imperialism is a crucial element to understand British foreign policy in the region.


**7. With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organisations in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British India Association, formed by a merger of the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily focused on promoting the interests of landlords.
2. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, led by Justice Ranade, played a significant role in shaping intellectual discourse on economic issues in India.
3. The Indian Association of Calcutta, founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, aimed to create an all-India political organization before the formation of the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While the British India Association did emerge from organizations representing landlord interests, its scope broadened to include wider public concerns.  The initial focus on landlord interests, however, is important to note.

Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, under Justice Ranade's leadership, was instrumental in shaping public opinion and intellectual discourse, particularly in the realm of economics.  It played a significant role in the evolution of nationalist thought.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Association of Calcutta, established before the Indian National Congress, actively worked towards creating an all-India platform for nationalist political activity. Its efforts to unify Indian political workers across regions were crucial in setting the stage for the Congress's formation.


**8. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, aiming to protect Muslim minority interests.
2.  The reforms granted substantial self-government to India, moving it closer to dominion status.
3. The reforms significantly increased the power of the Indian Legislative Council, allowing it to effectively control the government's actions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a policy with long-term consequences for Indian politics. While intended to protect Muslim interests, it also exacerbated communal divisions and hindered the development of a unified nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1909 reforms did *not* grant substantial self-government. They made only incremental changes to the existing system, leaving real power firmly in British hands. The promise of eventual self-government remained far from realization.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The reforms did *not* significantly increase the power of the Indian Legislative Council. The council remained largely advisory and lacked the power to effectively control the government's actions.  Real power continued to reside with the executive branch.


**9. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms introduced dyarchy in the provinces, demarcating subjects between central and provincial control.
2. The reforms established a fully responsible government in India, transferring complete control to elected Indian representatives.
3. The reforms introduced direct elections to the central legislature, expanding the franchise significantly.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1919 Act introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance where some subjects were under the control of elected ministers, while others remained under the reserved control of the Governor. This was a step towards responsible government but was far from complete transfer of power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1919 reforms did *not* establish a fully responsible government. Significant powers remained vested in the Governor-General and the British government.  The act represented a gradual, incremental approach to self-government rather than a complete transfer of power.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1919 Act introduced direct elections to the central legislature, although the franchise was limited based on property, tax, or education qualifications. This expansion of the electorate was a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully functioning All-India Federation, including both British India and the princely states.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, abolishing dyarchy and granting provinces significant self-governance.
3. The Act completely eliminated communal electorates, ensuring representation based solely on general constituencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1935 Act aimed to establish an All-India Federation, but it never fully materialized due to opposition from various Indian parties and the princely states' reluctance to join. The envisaged federation remained incomplete.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1935 Act abolished dyarchy in the provinces and granted them a significant degree of autonomy.  This was a major step towards self-governance, although the Governor still retained certain powers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 1935 Act did *not* completely eliminate communal electorates.  It instead expanded the system to include separate electorates for depressed classes, women, and labor, further exacerbating communal divisions.  This continued to hinder the development of a unified national identity.


**11. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Cornwallis introduced significant reforms to the civil service, aiming to reduce corruption and improve efficiency.
2. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the Company's patronage system.
3. The ICS was fully Indianized by the 1930s, ensuring Indian control over administrative positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Cornwallis's reforms were crucial in establishing a more structured and regulated civil service.  His efforts to raise salaries, ban private trade, and enforce rules against bribery were significant steps towards improving the administration.

Statement 2 is correct. The Charter Act of 1853 ended the Company's patronage system and introduced open competitive examinations for the ICS. While a significant step, it did not initially lead to substantial Indian representation in higher echelons.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICS was *not* fully Indianized by the 1930s.  While Indian representation increased over time due to nationalist pressure, key positions and power remained largely in the hands of British officers.  The Indianization process was gradual and incomplete.


**12. With reference to the development of education in India under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated a substantial sum for the promotion of education in India, significantly improving literacy rates.
2. Lord Macaulay's Minute of 1835 advocated for the exclusive use of English as the medium of instruction in higher education.
3. Wood's Despatch of 1854 emphasized the importance of mass education and the use of vernacular languages at the primary level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated a relatively small sum (one lakh rupees annually) for the promotion of education. This was insufficient to significantly impact literacy rates, and the funds were not consistently made available.

Statement 2 is correct. Lord Macaulay's Minute strongly advocated for English as the medium of instruction in higher education, reflecting a belief in the superiority of Western education. This policy had a lasting impact on India's education system.

Statement 3 is correct. Wood's Despatch of 1854, a landmark document, did emphasize mass education and the use of vernacular languages at the primary level. It aimed to create a more comprehensive and inclusive education system, although its implementation faced many challenges.


**13. With reference to the making of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution was drafted solely by the Drafting Committee, headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, without any input from other members of the Constituent Assembly.
2.  The Constituent Assembly adopted the Objectives Resolution, which laid down the guiding principles for the Constitution-making process.
3. The Indian Constitution came into effect on August 15, 1947, the day India gained independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Drafting Committee played a central role, the Constitution was not drafted solely by them.  The Constituent Assembly debated and amended the draft extensively, incorporating diverse perspectives and opinions.  The drafting process involved a collective effort, with numerous committees and individuals contributing.

Statement 2 is correct. The Objectives Resolution, moved by Jawaharlal Nehru, was a crucial step in setting the framework and guiding principles for the Constitution-making process. It outlined the vision for a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution came into effect on January 26, 1950, not on August 15, 1947 (the date of independence).  The Constituent Assembly continued its work after independence to complete the drafting and adoption of the Constitution.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Indian Nationalist Movement.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the early years of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists predominantly employed constitutional methods, focusing on petitions, meetings, and resolutions to pressure the British government for reforms.
2.  The "safety valve" theory posits that the Indian National Congress was primarily established to channel popular discontent and prevent violent uprisings.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions included not only political activism but also pioneering economic analysis, demonstrating the exploitative nature of British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The early phase of the Indian National Congress, often termed the "Moderate" phase, primarily focused on constitutional methods of political engagement.  They believed in reasoned dialogue and persuasion to achieve gradual reforms within the existing framework of British rule.  

Statement 2 is partially true but misleading as presented. While A.O. Hume, a key figure in the Congress's founding, did believe the Congress could act as a "safety valve," this is a simplification of a complex historical process. The Congress's emergence was also driven by the growing desire among educated Indians for a unified national platform to address their grievances. The statement overemphasizes the "safety valve" aspect to the detriment of other important motivations.

Statement 3 is entirely correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions extended beyond political leadership. His economic analyses, particularly his "drain of wealth" theory, provided a crucial economic dimension to the nationalist movement, demonstrating the material basis of British exploitation.  This understanding significantly shaped the movement's agenda.


**2. With reference to the militant nationalist phase of the Indian freedom struggle (1905-1909), consider the following statements:**

1. The partition of Bengal, primarily intended to weaken the nationalist movement, instead galvanized mass participation in the Swadeshi movement.
2.  The Swadeshi movement solely focused on economic self-reliance, advocating for the boycott of British goods without engaging in overt political defiance.
3.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, while introducing limited electoral reforms, also established separate electorates for Muslims, exacerbating communal divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The British government's decision to partition Bengal, ostensibly for administrative reasons, was widely perceived as a tactic to divide and weaken Bengal, a strong center of nationalist activity. The ensuing widespread opposition and the Swadeshi movement demonstrated the opposite effect—a surge in unified nationalist sentiment and participation across various segments of society.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Swadeshi movement, while promoting economic self-reliance through the boycott of British goods, was inherently political.  It was a direct challenge to British rule, aimed at undermining their economic control and asserting Indian national identity.  The movement encompassed various forms of political action beyond just boycotting goods.

Statement 3 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms, while a step towards greater Indian participation in governance, introduced the contentious element of separate electorates for Muslims. This measure, while intended to appease a section of the Muslim population, ultimately deepened communal divides and became a significant factor shaping the political landscape in the years to come.


**3. With reference to the impact of Western education on Indian society during British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of Western education was primarily driven by philanthropic motives, aiming to uplift Indian society through the dissemination of knowledge.
2. The "downward filtration theory" accurately describes the process by which Western ideas and knowledge effectively spread to the broader Indian population.
3.  The neglect of mass education and the emphasis on English as the medium of instruction created a significant gap between the educated elite and the masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some individuals and groups advocated for education based on philanthropic ideals, the British government's promotion of Western education was largely driven by pragmatic considerations. The need for a readily available pool of educated Indians to fill administrative and other subordinate positions within the colonial system was a major factor.  The hope that education would create a class loyal to British rule also played a significant role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "downward filtration theory," which posited that Western ideas would gradually spread from the educated elite to the masses, did not fully materialize. While some elements of Western thought did permeate society, the emphasis on English as the medium of instruction created a significant linguistic and cultural divide between the educated elite and the largely illiterate masses.  The spread of nationalist ideas often occurred through alternative channels such as political activism and the press.

Statement 3 is correct. The British educational policy, prioritizing higher education and using English as the medium of instruction, largely neglected mass education. This resulted in a wide gap between the small educated elite and the vast majority of the population who remained illiterate, creating social and political implications.


**4.  With reference to the methods and approaches of the early nationalists (1885-1905) and the subsequent militant nationalists (1905-1909), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists, often called Moderates, primarily focused on constitutional means of political action, while the militant nationalists adopted more assertive and confrontational strategies.
2. Both the Moderates and the Extremists shared the common goal of complete independence from British rule, differing only in their methods of achieving it.
3. The Surat Split of 1907 marked a significant division within the Indian National Congress, primarily between those favoring constitutional methods and those advocating more radical approaches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early nationalists, characterized as Moderates, largely believed in constitutional methods of political action, focusing on petitions, representations, and public appeals to the British government. The militant nationalists, or Extremists, in contrast, adopted more assertive strategies, including boycotts, passive resistance, and even revolutionary activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both groups sought self-rule for India, their visions differed.  The early nationalists initially advocated for self-government within the British Empire, a gradual transition to greater autonomy.  The militant nationalists, however, increasingly embraced the goal of complete independence from British rule.

Statement 3 is correct. The Surat Split of 1907 significantly divided the Indian National Congress. The schism primarily reflected differing approaches to the freedom struggle: the Moderates' preference for constitutional methods versus the Extremists' advocacy for more radical and confrontational strategies.  This split had long-lasting consequences for the nationalist movement.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) on Polity and Governance, based on the provided target content about the British educational policies in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors, testing factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.


**1. With reference to the British educational policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated one lakh rupees annually for the promotion of education in India, but this amount was not fully disbursed until 1823 due to internal disagreements on its allocation.
2. The Wood's Dispatch of 1854 advocated for a hierarchical education system, starting from vernacular primary schools in villages and culminating in affiliating universities in major cities.
3. Lord Macaulay's Minute of 1835 championed the exclusive use of Indian vernacular languages as the medium of instruction in all levels of education to promote national unity and identity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Charter Act of 1813 did allocate funds, but their disbursement was delayed due to debates on the best approach to education – the Orientalist-Anglicist controversy.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Wood's Dispatch proposed a structured system, aiming to create a bridge between Western learning and the Indian context.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. Macaulay's Minute advocated for English as the medium of instruction for higher education, believing it superior and more efficient for imparting Western knowledge,  This directly contradicts the statement's claim about vernacular languages.  The emphasis on English was a key feature of the British educational policy, often criticized for hindering mass education. The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement 3 or omit the correct statements 1 and 2.


**2. With reference to the impact of British educational policies on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction created a linguistic divide between the educated elite and the masses, hindering the widespread dissemination of modern ideas.
2. The 1844 declaration that applicants for government jobs should possess knowledge of English led to a decline in traditional Indian education systems due to lack of official support and shifting student preferences.
3. The British educational system prioritized mass education and literacy, leading to a significant increase in literacy rates across all social strata by the early 20th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the consequences of the British emphasis on English. It created a gap between the English-educated elite and the largely illiterate masses, limiting the reach of modern ideas beyond a small segment of society. Statement 2 is also correct; the 1844 declaration made English proficiency crucial for government employment, leading to the decline of traditional educational systems as students sought English-medium education. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The British educational system predominantly neglected mass education, resulting in extremely low literacy rates in the early 20th century, far from a significant increase.  The focus was on creating a class of Indians educated in Western ways to serve administrative and commercial purposes.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either include the false statement 3 or omit correct statements 1 and 2.



**3. Consider the following statements regarding the evolution of education in 19th-century India:**

1. The establishment of the Calcutta Madrasah and the Sanskrit College under the British East India Company primarily aimed at training future civil servants in Indian languages and customs.
2. The Orientalist-Anglicist controversy centered on the debate regarding the relative merits of traditional Indian learning versus modern Western education in shaping the Indian educational system.
3. The Wood's Dispatch of 1854 completely abandoned the "downward filtration theory" and immediately implemented a policy of universal, compulsory primary education throughout British India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the institutions also served broader educational goals, a primary motivation was to provide the Company with qualified individuals familiar with Indian laws and languages for administrative purposes. Statement 2 accurately describes the core of the Orientalist-Anglicist debate, which significantly influenced the direction of educational policy.  However, Statement 3 is false. While the Wood's Dispatch officially rejected the "downward filtration theory," the implementation of universal, compulsory primary education was far from immediate or complete.  The Dispatch laid the groundwork for a more comprehensive system but did not lead to immediate widespread mass education due to financial constraints and other factors. Option (a) is thus the only correct choice, as it accurately identifies the two true statements while excluding the false one.  The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement 3 or exclude the correct statements 1 and 2.


**4. With reference to the British educational policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hunter Commission (1882-83) primarily focused on improving higher education and university standards to produce a loyal and efficient administrative class.
2. The Indian Universities Act of 1904 increased government control over universities, partly due to concerns about universities becoming breeding grounds for political dissent.
3. The Sargent Plan (1944) aimed to achieve universal literacy in India within 40 years through a comprehensive, free, and compulsory education system from ages 6 to 14.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission primarily focused on primary and secondary education, recognizing their neglect in previous policies.  Statement 2 is correct. The 1904 Act increased government oversight of universities, reflecting concerns about their role in fostering nationalist sentiments. Statement 3 is also correct; the Sargent Plan proposed a long-term vision for universal literacy, encompassing free and compulsory education for the specified age group.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect, either including the false statement 1 or omitting the correct statements 2 and 3.  The question highlights the contrasting approaches and concerns within British educational policy across different periods.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist response to British educational policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, and Justice Ranade advocated for a greater role for Indian languages in the education system.
2.  The Swadeshi movement saw the establishment of national schools and colleges as an alternative to British-controlled institutions.
3. The early nationalists unanimously supported the introduction of English as the sole medium of instruction at all levels, believing it essential for national progress and modernization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; these prominent figures recognized the limitations of English-only education and advocated for the inclusion of Indian languages to promote wider access and national identity.  Statement 2 is also correct; the boycott of British institutions spurred the creation of alternative educational spaces rooted in Indian values and languages.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While some nationalists saw the value of English, there was significant opposition to its dominance as the sole medium of instruction, as it was seen as a tool of cultural imperialism and a barrier to mass education.  The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement 3 or omit the correct statements 1 and 2.  The question tests the understanding of the nuanced nationalist response to British educational policies.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the development of education in India under British rule.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the early development of education in India under the British, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of the Calcutta Madrasah and the Sanskrit College primarily aimed at creating a cadre of Indian administrators fluent in Persian and Sanskrit to facilitate legal administration.
2.  The Charter Act of 1813 allocated a significant sum (more than 5 lakh rupees annually) for the promotion of modern sciences and education in India, immediately impacting the educational landscape.
3. The Orientalist-Anglicist controversy primarily debated the medium of instruction (English vs. Indian languages), with Anglicists advocating solely for English.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Calcutta Madrasah and the Sanskrit College were indeed established to train Indians in Muslim and Hindu law respectively, facilitating the administration of justice within the Company's courts.  The focus on classical languages was crucial for communication with Indian states and populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Charter Act of 1813 did mandate an annual allocation for education, the amount was significantly less than 5 lakh rupees – only one lakh rupees annually. Furthermore, this sum wasn't readily available, and its disbursement faced considerable delays and controversy.  The immediate impact on the educational landscape was therefore limited.

Statement 3 is correct. The Orientalist-Anglicist debate was centered around the curriculum and the medium of instruction.  While the debate also involved the content of education (traditional Indian learning versus Western sciences), the focus on English versus vernacular languages was a central point of contention. The Anglicists strongly favored English as the sole medium of instruction.


**2. With reference to the evolution of educational policies in 19th and 20th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Wood's Despatch (1854) advocated for a hierarchical educational system, starting with vernacular primary schools and culminating in affiliating universities, while completely rejecting the ‘downward filtration theory’.
2. The Hunter Commission (1882-83) primarily focused on higher education, recommending the establishment of more teaching universities and promoting postgraduate studies.
3. The Sadler Commission (1917-19) recommended a 12-year school course culminating in an intermediate stage before university entry, aiming to improve the quality of university education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Wood's Despatch did propose a hierarchical system, it did *not* completely reject the 'downward filtration theory'. Although it acknowledged the need for mass education, the emphasis on English for higher studies still reflected the belief that Western knowledge would trickle down from the elite to the masses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission primarily focused on primary and secondary education, highlighting their neglect in earlier schemes.  Its recommendations were largely concerned with improving and expanding these levels of education, not higher education.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sadler Commission's recommendations did indeed include a 12-year school course with an intermediate stage before university, aiming to improve the quality and preparedness of university students. This restructuring was a key aspect of their proposals for improving university education.


**3. With reference to the development of education in India during the British Raj, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bethune School, established in Calcutta, was the first institution specifically dedicated to providing higher education for women, significantly impacting female literacy rates in the early 20th century.
2. The Wardha Scheme, while aiming for universal free and compulsory education, emphasized learning through activity and incorporated basic handicrafts into the curriculum.
3. The Sargent Plan, although ambitious, faced criticism for its lengthy timeline (40 years) to achieve universal literacy and its high projected costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bethune School was indeed a significant step towards women's education, but it focused primarily on *secondary* education, not higher education.  The impact on female literacy rates, while positive, was not transformative in the early 20th century due to the limited scope and reach of such institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Wardha Scheme, also known as Nai Talim, championed 'learning by doing', integrating basic crafts into the curriculum to make education relevant and practical.  This approach was closely aligned with Gandhian philosophy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sargent Plan, a post-World War II proposal, was criticized for its extensive timeframe (40 years) to achieve universal literacy and the significant financial resources it would require.  These factors contributed to concerns about its feasibility.



**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the impact of British educational policies in India:**

1. The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction created a linguistic divide between the educated elite and the masses, hindering the spread of modern ideas to the wider population.
2.  The British educational system significantly promoted scientific and technical education, establishing numerous engineering and medical colleges across the country by the late 19th century.
3. The neglect of girls’ education under British rule stemmed solely from the government's concern about offending orthodox Indian sensibilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The prioritization of English created a significant communication barrier, limiting access to modern knowledge and creating a chasm between the educated urban class and the largely illiterate rural population. This hindered the dissemination of progressive ideas and fostered social stratification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some medical and engineering colleges were established, the overall development of scientific and technical education was quite inadequate. The number of institutions was far too few to cater to the vast population, and access was often restricted based on factors like ethnicity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While concerns about upsetting orthodox groups played a role, the neglect of girls' education was also driven by the perceived lack of immediate utility for colonial administration. Women were not typically employed in government clerical positions, thus reducing the perceived economic benefit of educating them.  The lack of perceived economic value was a significant factor alongside social concerns.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided Target Content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the material, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British adopted a policy of "divide and rule" primarily by exploiting existing religious and caste divisions, but not regional differences.
2. The British consistently opposed modern education for Indians, viewing it as a threat to their authority from the very inception of the British Raj.
3. The British actively promoted Zamindars and landlords as traditional leaders to counter the influence of the nationalist intelligentsia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The British did utilize existing religious and caste divisions for their "divide and rule" policy. However, they also exploited regional differences to maintain control.  The deliberate manipulation of regional identities was a crucial aspect of their strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British did become increasingly hostile towards educated Indians who challenged their authority, particularly after the formation of the Indian National Congress, their initial approach wasn't uniformly opposed to modern education.  Early British policies did include some initiatives in education, albeit limited and serving primarily British interests.  The shift to outright hostility occurred gradually.

Statement 3 is correct. To counter the rising tide of nationalism among the educated elite, the British sought alliances with conservative social groups like Zamindars and landlords.  They presented these groups as the "natural" leaders of the people, thereby undermining the nationalist leadership and expanding their own social base.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, fostering agricultural development and prosperity.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly collected revenue from individual cultivators, resulting in equitable distribution of wealth and land.
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities, leading to increased village autonomy and economic stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement did grant proprietary rights to Zamindars, it did not lead to widespread agricultural development.  Instead, it resulted in absentee landlordism, exploitation of peasants, and hindered agricultural improvements due to the high revenue demands.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari System, while collecting revenue directly from cultivators, did not lead to equitable wealth distribution.  Overassessment of land revenue often led to peasant indebtedness and impoverishment.  It also lacked a proper survey system, leading to arbitrary taxation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari System, while initially aiming for collective assessment, often resulted in inaccurate calculations, corruption, and the exploitation of village communities through exorbitant tax demands. It failed to foster village autonomy and economic stability.  The system also did not prevent the rise of moneylenders exploiting indebted farmers.



**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and cultural life, which continued throughout the colonial period.
2. The Industrial Revolution in Britain significantly influenced British policies in India, leading to a desire to transform Indian society to create a market for British goods.
3. Christian missionaries actively supported both conservative and radical British administrators in India, primarily to spread Christianity and Western ideas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British initially adopted a policy of non-interference, this changed significantly after 1813. The emergence of new interests and ideas in Britain, particularly those stemming from the Industrial Revolution and the rise of industrial capitalism, led to a shift towards active attempts to transform Indian society.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Industrial Revolution fuelled a desire in Britain to make India a large consumer market for their manufactured goods. This economic imperative influenced British policies, leading to attempts to modernize and transform aspects of Indian society, although this modernization was often selective and served primarily British interests.

Statement 3 is correct. Christian missionaries in India saw the spread of Christianity as intertwined with the process of Westernization.  They strategically aligned themselves with both conservative and radical British administrators, believing that both approaches, in different ways, could weaken traditional Indian culture and beliefs, thereby making the population more receptive to Christianity. Their support also extended to business interests, hoping to expand their markets among Christian converts.


**4. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British pursued a foreign policy primarily focused on protecting their economic interests in India, with little regard for India's security concerns.
2.  The British expansion beyond India's natural frontiers was solely driven by a desire to secure India's defenses against external threats.
3.  Conflicts with other European powers in Asia and Africa were a direct consequence of British expansionist policies in India and the competition for colonial territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the British did prioritize their economic interests in India, their foreign policy also aimed to protect the Indian empire itself, viewing it as a valuable asset.  However, the pursuit of economic interests often overshadowed concerns for India's broader security and well-being.

Statement 2 is incorrect. British expansion beyond India's natural frontiers was driven by a complex interplay of factors, including the desire to secure strategic advantages, control trade routes, and compete with other European powers for colonial territories.  While defense was a consideration, it was not the sole or even primary motivator.

Statement 3 is correct. The British expansionist policies in India directly clashed with the colonial ambitions of other European powers, such as Russia and France. This competition for resources and influence led to several conflicts and heightened tensions in Asia and Africa. The pursuit of British interests often came at the cost of peace and stability in the region.  The expenditure of resources and manpower in these conflicts primarily fell on India.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of British land revenue systems in India:**

1. The British land revenue systems led to the equitable distribution of land ownership, benefiting both large and small landowners.
2. The introduction of new land revenue systems completely eradicated the existing traditional systems of land tenure and revenue collection.
3.  The British land revenue systems contributed significantly to the impoverishment of the Indian peasantry and the rise of rural indebtedness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems, including the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems, did not lead to an equitable distribution of land ownership.  Instead, they led to increased inequality, with the concentration of land in the hands of large landowners and the impoverishment of many small cultivators.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British introduced new systems, they did not completely eradicate traditional systems of land tenure and revenue collection.  Elements of traditional practices continued to exist alongside the new systems, often leading to conflicts and complexities.  The existing social structures were not fully replaced but were modified and adapted to serve the colonial regime.

Statement 3 is correct. The high revenue demands imposed by the British land revenue systems, coupled with flawed assessment methods and the growth of moneylending, led to widespread impoverishment of the Indian peasantry and a significant increase in rural indebtedness. This had long-lasting consequences for the rural economy and contributed to social unrest. The systems, regardless of their specific form, resulted in the exploitation of farmers and created a system where they were trapped in cycles of debt.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed factual recall and analysis.


**1. With reference to the pre-independence era in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Landholders’ Society, primarily comprising landlords from Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, was established in 1837, predating the establishment of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The Bengal British Indian Society, formed in 1843, focused solely on advocating for the interests of British citizens residing in Bengal.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji, known as the "Grand Old Man of India," established the East India Association in London to directly lobby the British Parliament for Indian independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Landholders’ Society was indeed established in 1837 and represented the interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  This accurately reflects its historical context as one of the earliest public associations in modern India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bengal British Indian Society's objective was broader than solely representing British interests. While it certainly engaged with British concerns in Bengal, its aim was to protect and promote general public interests, including those of Indians.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji did found the East India Association in London and was instrumental in advocating for Indian welfare,  the association's primary goal wasn't to directly lobby for immediate independence.  Its aim was to influence British public opinion and policy regarding India's well-being, which was a crucial step in the long road to independence.  The demand for "self-government" or Swaraj  evolved gradually within the Indian National Congress.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Association of Calcutta, founded in 1876, primarily focused on representing the interests of wealthy landowners and advocating for minor administrative reforms.
2. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, established in the 1870s, published a quarterly journal that significantly influenced intellectual discourse in India, particularly on economic issues.
3.  A. O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a pivotal role in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885, primarily motivated by a desire to prevent a violent uprising.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Association of Calcutta, while initially containing some wealthy members, was driven by younger nationalists who sought sustained political agitation on broader public interest issues.  Their focus extended beyond minor administrative reforms to encompass wider political participation and social justice.

Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, under Justice Ranade's guidance, did indeed publish a journal that played a significant role in shaping intellectual and economic thought within the burgeoning nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. A. O. Hume's role in the founding of the Indian National Congress is well-documented.  While his motives were complex, the "safety valve" theory, suggesting he aimed to prevent a violent uprising, is a significant aspect of his motivations, although not the sole factor.


**3. With reference to the pre-independence Indian political landscape, consider the following statements:**

1. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, while increasing elected representation in legislative councils, significantly empowered Indian voices in shaping national policies.
2.  The introduction of separate electorates under the Morley-Minto Reforms aimed to protect minority interests but inadvertently exacerbated communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims.
3. The Surat Split of 1907 within the Indian National Congress resulted in a permanent schism between moderate and extremist factions, hindering the movement's overall effectiveness for decades.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms, while increasing elected representation, did not significantly empower Indian voices in policymaking.  The councils remained largely advisory bodies with limited real power, and the official majority ensured British control persisted.  The reforms were more about managing dissent than granting substantial power.

Statement 2 is correct. The introduction of separate electorates was indeed intended to protect Muslim minority interests. However, this policy, by creating separate constituencies for Muslims,  reinforced communal identities and ultimately contributed to increased religious polarization and hindered the development of a united national identity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Surat Split of 1907 created a significant rift between moderate and extremist factions within the Congress, it wasn't a permanent schism.  The two factions continued to interact and engage with each other, even if with differing approaches, throughout the subsequent years of the freedom struggle.  The differences were primarily strategic, not irreconcilable ideological divides.


**4. With reference to the growth of communalism in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sayyid Ahmad Khan, despite being a significant educationist and social reformer, contributed to the rise of Muslim communalism by advocating for separate political interests for Hindus and Muslims.
2. The relative educational and economic backwardness of Muslims in British India, compared to Hindus, contributed to their susceptibility to communalist appeals.
3. The British government actively promoted communal harmony and discouraged separatist tendencies to maintain stability and control in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan, while a reformer in many respects, later in his life adopted a conservative political stance. He argued that the political interests of Hindus and Muslims were divergent, a viewpoint that contributed to the growth of Muslim separatism. This played a crucial role in shaping the communal landscape of the time.

Statement 2 is correct. The educational and economic disparities between Hindu and Muslim communities, created and exacerbated by British policies, made Muslims more vulnerable to communalist appeals.  The lack of equal opportunities in education and the economy meant that a significant portion of the Muslim population was more easily swayed by promises of special treatment or protection within a separate political framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British government's policy was far from promoting communal harmony.  Instead,  "divide and rule" was a core element of their strategy. They often exploited existing religious and caste divisions to weaken the overall nationalist movement and maintain their control.  The encouragement of separate electorates is a prime example of this strategy's negative impact.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Andolan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was a purely religious matter unrelated to Indian nationalism.
2. Mahatma Gandhi's leadership in the Non-Cooperation Movement was universally supported within the Indian National Congress, with no significant opposition to his strategies.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to concerns about escalating violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khilafat issue stemmed from concerns about the treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate, it became a powerful symbol of anti-imperialist sentiment and played a crucial role in forging Hindu-Muslim unity within the broader context of the Indian independence movement.  It was not a purely religious issue, but also a political one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi's leadership, while immensely influential, faced considerable opposition within the Congress.  There were disagreements regarding the strategy of non-cooperation, particularly concerning the boycott of councils and the overall approach to engaging with the British government.  Significant figures held differing views on the best course of action.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, characterized by violence against police, is accurately described as the catalyst for Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.  He was deeply committed to non-violent methods and believed that the incident indicated a dangerous shift towards violence, threatening the movement's effectiveness and core principles.  The suspension was a direct response to this concern.


**6.  With reference to the making of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution was drafted solely by the Constituent Assembly, with minimal influence from pre-independence nationalist movements or earlier constitutional proposals.
2. The Nehru Report of 1928, while outlining a draft constitution for India, did not significantly influence the final Constitution of independent India.
3. The Constituent Assembly adopted a consensus-based approach to decision-making, aiming for unanimity or near-unanimity on key provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution's drafting was deeply influenced by the pre-independence nationalist movement's demands for self-governance, responsible government, and fundamental rights. Earlier constitutional proposals and the debates surrounding them significantly shaped the thinking and discussions within the Constituent Assembly. The groundwork was laid long before 1946.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nehru Report of 1928,  a significant constitutional proposal,  had a substantial influence on the final Indian Constitution. Many of its key features, such as its emphasis on dominion status, fundamental rights, and a federal system, were reflected in the Constitution that was eventually adopted.

Statement 3 is correct. The Constituent Assembly's approach to decision-making is accurately described as consensus-based.  The members, recognizing the diverse perspectives within the nation, made significant efforts to reach agreements and compromises on key provisions, minimizing outright votes and prioritizing broad acceptance. This reflects a deliberate strategy to build national unity around the new Constitution.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, including detailed explanations.


**1. With reference to the pre-independence era in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Landholders’ Society, established in 1837, primarily focused on advocating for the interests of Bengal's landlords.
2. The Bengal British Indian Society, founded in 1843, aimed to protect and promote broader public interests.
3. The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association were established in 1851, showcasing the growing regional political consciousness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Landholders’ Society, established in 1837, was indeed primarily focused on representing the interests of the landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  This reflects the early stages of organized political activity in India, where elite groups initially formed associations to protect their specific class interests.  

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Bengal British Indian Society, established in 1843, aimed to represent broader public interests, going beyond the narrow concerns of the Landholders' Society. This signifies a shift towards more inclusive political representation, although still limited to a specific region.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association were established in 1852, not 1851. This seemingly minor chronological error highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC examinations.  While the establishment of these associations reflects the growing regional political consciousness, the incorrect date renders the statement factually flawed.  The slight difference in the year significantly alters the historical context and demonstrates the need for precise information.


**2. With reference to the early phases of Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association, established in London in 1866, aimed to influence British public opinion regarding Indian welfare.
2.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, primarily focused on criticizing administrative and legislative measures, was established in the 1860s.
3.  The Indian Association of Calcutta, founded in 1876, aimed to create a strong public opinion on political questions and unify the Indian people on a common political program.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji's establishment of the East India Association in London in 1866 demonstrates a strategic approach to influencing British policy by directly engaging with British public figures and opinion-makers. This highlights the evolving tactics of early nationalists in their struggle for greater Indian representation and self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was established in the 1870s, not the 1860s. This again underscores the importance of precise chronological accuracy in understanding historical developments. While the Sabha's focus on criticizing administrative and legislative measures is accurate, the incorrect timeframe compromises the statement's validity.  The decade difference is crucial for understanding the sequence of events within the broader context of the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Association of Calcutta, founded in 1876, aimed to build a strong public opinion and unify Indians politically. This demonstrates the growing ambition of early nationalists to move beyond regional concerns and work towards a unified national political agenda.  The low membership fees extended to poorer classes shows their attempt to broaden their base beyond the elite.

**3. With reference to the pre-independence Indian political landscape, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Congress, founded in December 1885, was the first all-India political organization explicitly aiming to unite nationalists against foreign rule.
2. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, partly motivated by a "safety valve" theory to manage popular discontent.
3. The "safety valve" theory regarding the founding of the Indian National Congress fully explains the motivations behind its establishment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While there were preceding organizations, the Indian National Congress was the first truly all-India organization explicitly focused on uniting nationalists and challenging British rule on a national scale.  This marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A.O. Hume's involvement in the Congress's founding is well-documented, and the "safety valve" theory, while not the sole motivation, was indeed a significant factor in his thinking. He believed that providing a platform for political expression might prevent more violent forms of resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "safety valve" theory is only a partial explanation for the Congress's founding.  Other motivations, such as the genuine desire of Indian leaders for self-governance and national progress, were equally important.  Attributing the founding solely to this theory oversimplifies a complex historical process and ignores the multifaceted nature of the movement's origins.  The statement presents a reductionist interpretation of a nuanced historical phenomenon.


**4. Consider the following statements about the 1928 Calcutta Congress Session:**

1. The Nehru Report, advocating for dominion status, was approved at this session.
2.  Younger Congress leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, expressed dissatisfaction with the dominion status goal.
3.  The Calcutta session immediately launched a civil disobedience movement, demanding Purna Swaraj.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru Report, which outlined a framework for dominion status within the British Empire, was indeed approved at the Calcutta session of the Congress in 1928. This represented a significant step in the ongoing debate within the Congress about the ultimate goal of the national movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Younger Congress leaders were dissatisfied with the dominion status proposal, advocating for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) instead. This generational divide within the Congress reflected the growing impatience with the slow pace of constitutional reforms and the desire for a more radical approach to achieving self-rule.  This divergence in opinion played a major role in shaping the future trajectory of the Indian independence movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Calcutta session did not immediately launch a civil disobedience movement.  Instead, it gave the British government a one-year ultimatum to accept dominion status.  Only when this ultimatum expired, did the Congress launch the movement demanding complete independence. This highlights the strategic approach adopted by the Congress leaders, balancing radical demands with a measured approach to political engagement.  The sequence of events is crucial in understanding the Congress's strategy.


**5. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1931, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pact resulted in the unconditional release of all political prisoners.
2. The pact led to the immediate restoration of all confiscated lands.
3. The pact secured the right to make salt for personal consumption in coastal villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The pact led to the release of many political prisoners, but it was not unconditional for all.  Some prisoners convicted of violence were excluded from the amnesty.  This highlights the limitations of the pact and the complexities of negotiating with a colonial power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the pact promised the return of confiscated lands, the restoration was not immediate and applied only to lands not yet sold to third parties. This demonstrates the practical challenges in implementing the terms of the agreement and the continued power of the colonial administration.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact did secure the right for Indians to make salt for personal consumption in coastal villages. This seemingly small concession was symbolically significant, as it directly challenged the British salt monopoly, a major source of revenue and a symbol of colonial oppression.  The symbolic importance of this concession far outweighs its economic impact.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on diverse aspects of British policies in India, demanding detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British implemented a policy of "divide and rule" by fostering conflicts between princely states and their populations, different regions, provinces, castes, and religious groups.
2.  Following the 1857 revolt, the British initially repressed Muslims but later, after 1870, strategically utilized educated Muslims to counter the rising tide of Indian nationalism.
3. The British consistently supported social reforms in India, viewing them as essential for modernizing the country and aligning it with Western values.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British "divide and rule" policy is a well-documented aspect of their colonial administration. They actively exploited existing social and religious divisions to prevent the emergence of a unified nationalist movement that could challenge their authority.  This involved pitting different groups against each other, hindering collective action against British rule.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The British response to the 1857 revolt initially involved harsh repression of Muslims. However, recognizing the potential for utilizing certain segments of Indian society against the burgeoning nationalist movement, they shifted their approach after 1870. Educated Muslims, often facing similar disadvantages in accessing resources and opportunities as their Hindu counterparts, were strategically co-opted to create a religious divide within the educated Indian class.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British approach to social reform was far from consistent. While initially showing some support for certain reforms, particularly those aligned with their economic and political interests (like modernizing certain aspects of society to better facilitate exploitation), they later reversed course.  As the nationalist movement gained momentum, the British increasingly sided with conservative and orthodox elements in Indian society, often actively hindering social reforms that challenged existing power structures and potentially fueled nationalist sentiment.  This shift reflects a deliberate policy of maintaining the status quo to safeguard their colonial rule.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their lands, leading to the growth of absentee landlordism.
2.  The Ryotwari system, prevalent in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly taxed individual cultivators (ryots), often leading to overassessment and peasant indebtedness.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, involved collective assessment of revenue from village communities (mahals), ensuring equitable distribution of tax burden among cultivators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Permanent Settlement. While intended to secure a stable revenue stream for the British, it resulted in the concentration of land ownership in the hands of zamindars, many of whom became absentee landlords, focusing on rent collection rather than agricultural improvement.  This led to exploitation of the peasantry and hindered agricultural progress.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the key features of the Ryotwari system.  Direct taxation of individual cultivators, coupled with often inaccurate assessments of land productivity, frequently resulted in overtaxation and widespread peasant indebtedness.  The system, while aiming for direct revenue collection, often failed to account for variations in agricultural yields and market prices, pushing many ryots into poverty.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Mahalwari system did involve village communities as the unit of revenue assessment, it did not necessarily ensure equitable distribution of the tax burden.  In practice, the system often suffered from inaccuracies in assessment, leading to unequal burdens on different cultivators within a mahal.  Furthermore, the village headman (lambardar) often wielded considerable power, potentially leading to exploitation and corruption in revenue collection.  The system, therefore, did not effectively protect cultivators from undue financial hardship.


**3. With reference to British labor legislations in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The first Factory Act in India, passed in 1881, primarily addressed the issue of child labor, restricting working hours and prohibiting the employment of children below a certain age.
2. The Indian Factory Act of 1891 further strengthened child labor regulations, reducing maximum working hours for children and women, and mandating a weekly holiday for all workers.
3. These early factory acts were universally applied across all industries and sectors in British India, effectively protecting workers' rights and improving working conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the initial focus of the 1881 Factory Act.  The act was a crucial first step in regulating exploitative labor practices, particularly concerning child labor.  It introduced limitations on working hours for children and prohibited the employment of very young children, marking a significant, albeit limited, improvement in working conditions for a specific vulnerable group.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 1891 Act built upon the 1881 legislation, further strengthening protections for child and female labor.  It tightened restrictions on working hours and introduced a mandatory weekly holiday, reflecting a gradual (though still insufficient) enhancement of labor regulations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  A critical limitation of these early factory acts was their limited scope and application.  They notably excluded crucial sectors like tea and coffee plantations, where workers faced severe exploitation. This selective enforcement significantly undermined the effectiveness of the legislation in achieving widespread improvements in working conditions across British India. The laws were often poorly enforced, allowing continued exploitation in many sectors.


**4.  With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and cultural life but later, influenced by various factors including the Industrial Revolution and the rise of new ideologies in Europe, actively sought to transform Indian society.
2.  The British consistently supported Indian social reformers who sought to eradicate social evils like sati and promote women's education, viewing these reforms as crucial for modernizing India.
3. Christian missionaries played a significant role in promoting Western education and social reform in India, often aligning themselves with radical and paternalistic imperialist factions within the British administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The early British colonial policy in India often involved a degree of non-interference in social and religious matters, primarily focused on consolidating political and economic control. However, as the 19th century progressed, influenced by the Industrial Revolution, changing ideologies in Britain, and the rise of a reformist intelligentsia in India, the British approach shifted. They began to actively pursue policies aimed at transforming Indian society, though often in ways that served their colonial interests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some individual British officials may have expressed support for specific social reforms, the overall British policy towards social reform was inconsistent and opportunistic.  They often selectively supported reforms that aligned with their broader colonial goals, while simultaneously hindering or suppressing those that threatened their authority or challenged existing power structures.  The British response to social reform was often driven by pragmatic considerations rather than a genuine commitment to social justice.

Statement 3 is correct. Christian missionaries played a significant role in promoting Western education and social reform in India. Their efforts were often intertwined with the broader political and economic agendas of the British colonial administration.  Missionaries frequently aligned themselves with different factions within the British administration, including those advocating for radical social change and those supporting a more paternalistic approach to governing India.  Their motives were complex, blending religious zeal with a belief in the superiority of Western culture and civilization.  Their actions had a significant impact on the social and intellectual landscape of India during the colonial period.


**5. With reference to British relations with Princely States in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Before 1857, the British pursued a policy of annexation of Princely States, but after the 1857 revolt, they shifted to a policy of preserving the princely states as allies and a bulwark against future uprisings.
2. The British guaranteed the territorial integrity of the princely states and their right to adopt heirs, thereby securing their loyalty and cooperation in maintaining British rule.
3.  Despite the guarantees, the British exercised paramountcy over the princely states, interfering in their internal affairs and controlling their administrations through resident officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the change in British policy towards Princely States.  The pre-1857 period witnessed a more aggressive policy of annexation, aimed at expanding British territorial control.  The 1857 revolt demonstrated the risks of this approach, highlighting the need for a more conciliatory strategy.  Consequently, the British shifted to a policy of preserving the princely states, recognizing their potential value as allies and a counterbalance to nationalist movements.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The British offered guarantees of territorial integrity and the right of adoption to the rulers of the princely states. These guarantees were crucial in securing the loyalty of the princely rulers, who played a significant role in maintaining British power in India.  This policy helped stabilize the political landscape and prevent the unification of opposition forces against British rule.

Statement 3 is equally correct.  While the British offered guarantees to the princely states, they simultaneously exercised paramountcy, asserting ultimate authority over their internal affairs.  Resident officials stationed in the princely states played a key role in controlling their administrations, ensuring that the rulers remained loyal to the British Crown and their policies aligned with British interests.  This dual approach allowed the British to maintain control while ostensibly respecting the autonomy of the princely rulers.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding British administrative policies in India post-1857:**

1. The British implemented a "divide and rule" strategy, exacerbating existing religious, regional, and caste divisions to maintain control.
2.  The British actively fostered alliances with Zamindars and landlords, utilizing them as a counterbalance against the rising nationalist intelligentsia.
3. The British significantly increased funding for social services like education, healthcare, and sanitation to improve the lives of the Indian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British colonial administration actively employed a "divide and rule" strategy to weaken the potential for unified opposition to their rule. This involved exploiting existing social and religious cleavages, pitting different groups against each other, and preventing the formation of a cohesive national movement. This policy is a well-documented aspect of British colonial rule in India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Post-1857, the British sought to bolster their control by cultivating alliances with traditional power structures.  Zamindars and landlords were strategically supported and empowered to act as a counterweight to the growing influence of nationalist intellectuals and movements. This alliance provided the British with a base of support among the Indian elite and helped to suppress dissent.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British colonial government, far from increasing spending on social services, significantly underfunded these areas.  A disproportionate amount of revenue was dedicated to maintaining a large army and the administrative apparatus necessary for colonial control.  This neglect of social services had long-lasting negative consequences for India's development. The meagre resources allocated were primarily directed towards urban areas and benefited the elite sections of society, further marginalizing the vast majority of the population.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted Zamindars proprietary rights over their lands in exchange for a fixed revenue payment to the British.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots).
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, involved revenue collection from villages or groups of villages (Mahals) as a collective unit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of the major British land revenue systems in India.

Statement 1 correctly outlines the Permanent Settlement, a system that aimed to stabilize land revenue collection by granting Zamindars proprietary rights. While it did bring some stability, its high revenue demands often led to Zamindari indebtedness and exploitation of peasants.  The system's limited geographical reach is also a point to note.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Ryotwari System, which directly assessed and collected revenue from individual cultivators.  While theoretically granting ryots ownership, the system's high tax rates and periodic revisions often led to peasant impoverishment.  The system's implementation varied across regions, with inconsistencies in land surveys and assessments.

Statement 3 correctly describes the Mahalwari System, a compromise between the Permanent Settlement and Ryotwari System.  Revenue was collected collectively from villages or groups of villages, with village headmen playing a crucial role in revenue collection.  Like the other systems, the Mahalwari system also had its flaws, including high tax demands and potential for exploitation.  The system's variations across regions also need to be acknowledged.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and cultural affairs, but this changed significantly after 1813.
2. The British consistently supported social reform movements in India, viewing them as crucial for the modernization of Indian society.
3. The introduction of the printing press and subsequent growth of the Indian press played a significant role in shaping public opinion and influencing government policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The British East India Company initially adopted a policy of non-interference in the religious and social life of India. However, this changed significantly after 1813, influenced by the rise of various ideologies and interests within Britain, including the Industrial Revolution, intellectual movements, and the impact of the French Revolution.  This shift led to increased British involvement in Indian social and cultural affairs, often with unintended consequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the British did support some social reforms, particularly in the early 19th century, their support was inconsistent and often driven by their own strategic interests.  After the 1857 revolt, the British shifted towards a more conservative stance, often aligning themselves with orthodox elements of Indian society to maintain stability and counter nationalist movements. The British often viewed social reforms with suspicion, fearing they could destabilize their rule.

Statement 3 is correct. The introduction of the printing press by the British had a profound impact on India. The growth of the Indian press provided a platform for nationalists to express their views, critique British policies, and mobilize public opinion.  The press played a crucial role in shaping the nationalist movement and challenging colonial authority.  However, the British also attempted to control the press through various acts and regulations, demonstrating the inherent tension between colonial power and the dissemination of information.


**4. With reference to the British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British foreign policy in India was primarily driven by the need to protect British commercial and economic interests in the region.
2. The British actively sought to expand their territorial control beyond India's natural frontiers, leading to conflicts with neighboring countries and other European powers.
3.  The British consistently prioritized the interests of the Indian population in their foreign policy decisions, ensuring India's security and well-being.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  British foreign policy in India was fundamentally shaped by the pursuit of British economic and commercial interests.  The acquisition of territories and the establishment of political control were largely aimed at securing access to resources, markets, and trade routes. This economic motivation is a key factor in understanding British expansion in India and its interactions with neighboring powers.

Statement 2 is also correct. The British expansionist policy led to the extension of their influence and control beyond India's natural frontiers. This resulted in conflicts with neighboring countries, as the British sought to secure strategic advantages and resources.  Competition with other European powers, particularly Russia and France, further fueled British expansionism and contributed to regional instability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  British foreign policy decisions rarely prioritized the interests of the Indian population.  The costs of British expansionism – both financial and human – were largely borne by India, while the benefits primarily accrued to Britain.  The pursuit of British imperial interests often came at the expense of Indian sovereignty, security, and well-being.  This disregard for Indian interests is a central criticism of British colonial policy.


**5. Consider the following statements about the impact of British land revenue systems in India:**

1. The British land revenue systems led to the widespread impoverishment of the peasantry due to high tax demands and exploitative practices.
2. The introduction of private property rights in land, facilitated by the British, resulted in increased agricultural productivity and economic prosperity for Indian farmers.
3. The British revenue systems significantly strengthened the traditional village communities and preserved their social and economic structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The British land revenue systems, while aiming to maximize revenue for the colonial government, had devastating consequences for the Indian peasantry.  High tax demands, coupled with exploitative practices by Zamindars, moneylenders, and revenue officials, led to widespread impoverishment, indebtedness, and displacement of farmers.  Famines were exacerbated by these policies, resulting in significant loss of life and widespread suffering.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the British introduced private property rights in land, this did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or economic prosperity for Indian farmers.  Instead, it often led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few, exacerbating existing inequalities and reducing the economic opportunities available to the majority of the peasantry.  The system also facilitated the rise of absentee landlords and the further exploitation of tenant farmers.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British land revenue systems significantly undermined the traditional structure of Indian village communities.  The introduction of new forms of land ownership and revenue collection disrupted traditional social and economic relationships, leading to the disintegration of village communities and the marginalization of many traditional occupations.  The focus on maximizing revenue often disregarded the social and economic well-being of the villages.


**1. With reference to the early British educational policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of English-medium schools was largely driven by the government's need for a cheap supply of educated Indians to fill administrative and business positions.
2.  The Wood's Despatch of 1854 advocated for a system of education that prioritized mass literacy and neglected higher education.
3. The neglect of girls' education was primarily due to the government's concern about upsetting orthodox Indian sensibilities and the perceived lack of immediate practical use for female clerks in government service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the British government's emphasis on a cheap supply of educated Indians for administrative and business roles was a major factor driving the adoption of modern education, particularly English-medium schools.  The cost-effectiveness of employing educated Indians rather than importing numerous Englishmen was a key motivation.  This aligns with the colonial administrative strategy of utilizing local resources for cost-efficient governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Wood's Despatch of 1854 aimed to address the neglect of mass education, it did *not* neglect higher education. In fact, the despatch proposed a hierarchical system encompassing vernacular primary schools, Anglo-Vernacular High Schools, affiliated colleges, and affiliating universities.  The despatch aimed for a comprehensive system, albeit one that prioritized English medium for higher education and vernaculars at the lower levels. The "downward filtration theory" reflects this approach.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly explains that the near-total neglect of girls' education stemmed from the government's apprehension of antagonizing orthodox Indian society and the lack of immediate practical utility for educated women in the colonial administration.  This reveals the complex interplay between colonial policy, social conservatism, and pragmatic administrative considerations in shaping the educational landscape. The low literacy rate among women in 1921 further underscores this neglect.


**2. With reference to the impact of Western culture on 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Rammohun Roy advocated for a complete rejection of traditional Indian philosophical systems in favor of an exclusive embrace of Western thought.
2. The introduction of Western education was expected to reconcile the Indian population to British rule by glorifying British conquerors and their administration.
3.  The British aimed to use modern education to create a class of Indians who were Indian in blood and color but English in taste, opinions, morals, and intellect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Raja Rammohun Roy championed the adoption of certain aspects of Western culture, particularly reason and scientific thought, he did *not* advocate for a complete rejection of traditional Indian philosophical systems. The passage highlights his synthesis of Eastern and Western thought, demonstrating his deep respect for traditional Indian philosophy while advocating for the adoption of rational and scientific approaches.  His work, "Gift to Monotheists," exemplifies this nuanced perspective.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage clearly indicates that the British expected Western education to foster acceptance of their rule.  The propagation of modern ideas, through education,  was intended to serve the political interests of the colonial government.  This strategy aimed to create a sense of alignment between the educated elite and the British administration.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage directly quotes Macaulay's assertion of the British aim to cultivate a class of Indians who would serve as intermediaries between the rulers and the governed, adopting Western values and intellect while retaining their Indian origins. This reflects a clear strategy of using education to consolidate British power. The "Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste" quote perfectly illustrates this point.


**3. With reference to British land revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, introduced primarily in South India, resulted in a system of peasant ownership where cultivators had complete control over their land.
2.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal and other regions, aimed to create a class of wealthy zamindars who would support British rule and ensure stable land revenue.
3. The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of North India, involved revenue settlements made directly with individual cultivators, bypassing village communities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ryotwari system aimed to collect revenue directly from cultivators, it did *not* result in a system of true peasant ownership.  The cultivators were still subject to high and often fluctuating land revenue demands, leaving them vulnerable to poverty and exploitation. The government retained significant control over land, negating complete ownership rights for the cultivators.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Permanent Settlement was indeed designed to create a class of wealthy zamindars who would be financially invested in the stability of British rule. By securing stable revenue streams, the British hoped to establish a cooperative relationship with a powerful segment of Indian society.  This strategy, however, had unintended consequences, leading to the exploitation of peasants by absentee landlords.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system did *not* involve settlements directly with individual cultivators. Instead, it involved collective settlements with village communities or estates (mahals), making the village headman or a group of village leaders responsible for revenue collection.  This contrasted with the Ryotwari system's direct engagement with individual cultivators.


**4. With reference to British administrative policies in India post-1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The British pursued a policy of "divide and rule," exacerbating existing religious, regional, and caste divisions to weaken the rising nationalist movement.
2.  The British consistently supported social reform movements in India, seeing them as a means of modernizing the country and fostering loyalty to the crown.
3. Following the 1857 revolt, the British displayed a consistently hostile attitude towards educated Indians, viewing them as a threat to their authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly describes the British strategy of exploiting existing social divisions – religious, regional, and caste – to prevent the formation of a unified nationalist front capable of challenging their rule. This "divide and rule" tactic was a cornerstone of their post-1857 policies.  The manipulation of communal tensions is explicitly mentioned as a tool to maintain control.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that after 1857, the British largely *abandoned* their earlier support for social reform movements, choosing instead to align themselves with conservative elements in Indian society.  This shift in policy reflected their desire to maintain control by appeasing traditional power structures and suppressing potentially destabilizing reform efforts.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage details the shift in British attitude towards educated Indians following the 1857 revolt.  Initially, there was some acceptance, but as educated Indians began to articulate nationalist sentiments and demand greater participation in governance, the British became increasingly hostile, viewing them as a threat to their authority. This hostility manifested in various policies aimed at curbing their influence.


**5. With reference to the British educational system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hunter Commission of 1882-83 primarily focused on improving higher education and establishing new universities.
2. The Wood's Despatch of 1854 advocated for the use of English as the medium of instruction for higher education and vernacular languages at the school level.
3. The Wardha Scheme of Basic Education, developed by the Congress, emphasized "learning through activity" and promoted the use of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission of 1882-83 primarily focused on primary and secondary education, highlighting their inadequacies and recommending improvements.  While it touched upon higher education, its main concern was the expansion and improvement of education at the lower levels, particularly in vernacular languages.  The establishment of new universities was not its primary focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The Wood's Despatch of 1854 indeed advocated for a dual language approach, recommending English for higher education and vernacular languages for school-level instruction. This reflected the British strategy of using English as the language of administration and higher learning while acknowledging the importance of vernacular languages for mass education.

Statement 3 is correct. The Wardha Scheme of Basic Education, a product of the Congress's educational vision, strongly emphasized the principle of "learning through activity," rooted in Gandhian philosophy.  It promoted the use of the mother tongue as the primary medium of instruction, aiming to connect education with the lived experiences of the students and the local community.  The scheme aimed to create a more relevant and accessible education system.


**1. With reference to the administrative changes after 1858 in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 introduced the portfolio system, laying the foundation for cabinet government in India, with each administrative branch having its head responsible for its administration.
2.  The financial decentralization initiated by Lord Mayo in 1870 involved transferring specific services (police, jails, education, etc.) to provincial governments with fixed grants, allowing them greater control over their administration.
3.  Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 aimed at establishing local self-government bodies where non-officials would be in the majority, elected wherever feasible, marking a significant step towards decentralization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key administrative changes after 1858.  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did indeed introduce the portfolio system, a crucial step towards the development of a cabinet-style government in India. Each department had a designated head responsible for its administration, marking a shift from the earlier, more centralized structure.  Lord Mayo's 1870 initiatives represent a significant step towards financial decentralization. While the central government maintained overall control, the transfer of specific services and the provision of fixed grants gave provincial governments more autonomy in their administration. Lord Ripon's 1882 resolution is widely recognized as a landmark in the development of local self-government in India. The emphasis on non-official majorities and elected members, although with limitations, was a substantial move towards empowering local communities and decentralizing power.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and incorrect.


**2. With reference to British administrative policies in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy of "divide and rule" was intensified, exploiting existing religious, caste, and regional differences to prevent a unified nationalist movement.  The British actively fostered antagonism between Hindus and Muslims.
2.  The British administration actively discouraged modern education among Indians, viewing educated Indians as a potential threat to their authority, reversing an earlier, more supportive approach.
3.  The British cultivated alliances with the zamindars and landlords, supporting their interests and privileges to counter the growing influence of the nationalist intelligentsia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of British administrative policy post-1857. The "divide and rule" strategy, already employed during the conquest of India, was consciously intensified after the 1857 rebellion.  The British exploited existing social divisions—religious (Hindu-Muslim), caste, and regional—to weaken any potential unified opposition to their rule.  This included actively promoting conflicts and rivalries between different groups. The shift in British attitude towards modern education is also significant. While initially encouraging education to create a class of clerks and administrators, the British grew wary of educated Indians who began using their knowledge to analyze and critique colonial rule.  This led to a marked change in policy, with active discouragement of higher education and hostility towards the educated nationalist leadership. The British also shifted their support towards the traditional elites—zamindars and landlords.  By bolstering the power and privileges of these groups, the British sought to create a counterbalance to the growing nationalist movement and its intellectual leadership.  These alliances further cemented the British hold on power and helped maintain social control. Therefore, the only correct option is (d).


**3. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICS was initially established by Lord Cornwallis with a focus on raising salaries and enforcing strict rules against corruption, aiming to create a more efficient and honest administrative service.
2.  Lord Wellesley's attempt to establish the Fort William College for training ICS recruits was later replaced by the East India College at Haileybury in England, highlighting the British preference for training in England.
3.  The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the previous system of patronage and nominations, although Indians faced significant barriers to entry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect key stages in the development of the ICS. Lord Cornwallis played a pivotal role in establishing and organizing the ICS, implementing reforms aimed at improving its efficiency and integrity.  His measures included raising salaries to reduce corruption and enforcing strict rules against private trade and bribery.  While his reforms were significant, they didn't completely eradicate corruption. Lord Wellesley's initiative to establish the Fort William College in Calcutta for training ICS recruits was indeed short-lived. The Court of Directors disapproved and replaced it with the East India College at Haileybury in England, demonstrating the British preference for controlling the training and indoctrination of their administrative officers. The Charter Act of 1853 marked a significant turning point in ICS recruitment. It introduced open competitive examinations, ending the system of patronage and nominations that had previously prevailed. However, the examinations were held in England, in English, and were designed in a way that disproportionately favored British candidates. This ensured that despite the introduction of open competition, the ICS remained largely dominated by Europeans for many years, with Indians facing numerous barriers to entry. Therefore, option (d) is the most accurate.


**4. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, granted proprietary rights to the zamindars, aiming to create a system similar to the British landed aristocracy, but it led to several issues, including high revenue rates and the growth of absentee landlordism.
2.  The Ryotwari system, implemented in Madras Presidency, involved collecting revenue directly from individual cultivators (ryots), aiming for increased revenue for the Company, but it often resulted in overassessment and exploitation of the peasantry.
3.  The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, involved collective assessment of revenue at the village level (mahal), aiming for a more equitable system, but it suffered from inaccuracies in assessment and potential for corruption.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the features and consequences of the major British revenue systems in India. The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, aimed to create a system mirroring the British landed gentry, granting zamindars proprietary rights over their lands. However, the fixed high revenue rates often led to zamindars defaulting on payments, resulting in the sale of their lands and the rise of absentee landlordism.  The Ryotwari system, designed to collect revenue directly from cultivators, aimed to maximize revenue for the British East India Company. However, its implementation often resulted in overassessment of land revenue, leading to the exploitation and impoverishment of the peasantry.  The Mahalwari system, while aiming for a more equitable approach by assessing revenue collectively at the village level (mahal), suffered from practical challenges. Inaccurate assessments and opportunities for corruption undermined its intended fairness, leading to similar issues of exploitation as the other systems.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, and option (d) is the appropriate choice.


**5. With reference to the British Army in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  After the 1857 rebellion, the British reorganized the army to ensure European dominance, increasing the proportion of European troops and maintaining a strict monopoly over key positions and departments (artillery, etc.).
2.  The reorganization of the Indian section of the army was based on the principle of "divide and rule," utilizing caste, regional, and religious differences to prevent unified action against the British.
3.  Despite efforts to isolate Indian soldiers from nationalist ideas, sections of the Indian army eventually played a significant role in India's struggle for independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the British approach to the Indian army after 1857. The post-1857 reorganization was driven by the need to prevent future rebellions and maintain British supremacy. This involved significantly increasing the proportion of European troops in the army and concentrating them in key strategic positions and departments like artillery.  The Indian sections of the army were deliberately reorganized to exploit existing social divisions.  The policy of "divide and rule" was applied by recruiting soldiers from different castes, regions, and religious groups, ensuring that there was no single, unified Indian military force that could challenge British authority. The British also actively tried to prevent nationalist ideas from reaching the soldiers. However, despite these efforts, the army's composition and the changing political climate in India eventually led to sections of the Indian army participating in the struggle for independence.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate, making (d) the correct option.


**6. With reference to the development of the judiciary under British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Warren Hastings established District Diwani Adalats for civil disputes and District Fauzdari Adalats for criminal disputes, introducing a more structured judicial system based on existing Indian legal frameworks.
2.  Lord Cornwallis implemented significant judicial reforms, separating revenue and justice administration, establishing a hierarchy of courts, and bringing European subjects under the jurisdiction of Indian courts in most cases.
3.  The establishment of High Courts at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras in 1865 marked a crucial step in consolidating the British judicial system, replacing the earlier system of Sadar Adalats and the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate, while statement 2 contains inaccuracies. Warren Hastings did introduce a more structured judicial system, establishing Diwani Adalats for civil cases and Fauzdari Adalats for criminal cases. These courts, while attempting to integrate existing Indian legal practices, were also designed to serve British interests. The establishment of High Courts in 1865 was indeed a significant step, consolidating the British judicial structure by merging the functions of the Supreme Court and Sadar Adalats.  However, statement 2 is incorrect in several aspects. While Lord Cornwallis did implement significant judicial reforms, including separating revenue and justice administration and establishing a hierarchy of courts, he did *not* bring European subjects under the jurisdiction of Indian courts in most cases.  Europeans generally retained special privileges and were often tried separately under different legal systems.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully correct, making (b) the correct option.


**7. With reference to the British policy towards princely states in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British abandoned their annexationist policy, guaranteeing the territorial integrity of princely states and respecting their right to adopt heirs, as a reward for their loyalty during the 1857 rebellion.
2.  The British maintained a policy of complete subordination of princely states, exercising paramountcy to interfere in their internal affairs and control their administrations through Residents and the appointment/dismissal of officials.
3.  The assumption of the title "Empress of India" by Queen Victoria in 1876 and Lord Curzon's later pronouncements solidified British sovereignty over the entire Indian subcontinent, including princely states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the British policy towards princely states after 1857.  Following the 1857 rebellion, the British adopted a new approach toward princely states, abandoning their previous policy of annexation.  The loyalty displayed by many princely states during the rebellion led to a guarantee of their territorial integrity and the right to adopt heirs, securing their continued existence.  However, this did not translate into genuine autonomy.  The British maintained strict control over the princely states through the doctrine of paramountcy, which allowed them to interfere in internal affairs.  This interference was exercised through Residents stationed in princely courts, who had considerable influence over the rulers' decisions and the appointment and dismissal of officials.  The assumption of the title "Empress of India" by Queen Victoria in 1876 and Lord Curzon's later pronouncements were clear demonstrations of British sovereignty over the entire Indian subcontinent, including the princely states.  The princely rulers were effectively reduced to subordinate rulers under British paramountcy. Thus, all three statements are correct, and the answer is (c).


**8. With reference to British policies regarding social reforms and social services in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British abandoned their earlier support for social reforms, fearing that such reforms might further alienate conservative sections of society and potentially lead to unrest, aligning themselves with orthodox elements.
2.  The British administration prioritized military expenditure and administrative costs over social services like education, sanitation, and public health, resulting in significant backwardness in these areas.
3.  While some initial labor legislation was introduced in the late 19th century in response to pressure from British manufacturers, it was largely inadequate and did not apply to many sectors, particularly plantations owned by British companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect British policies regarding social reforms and social services in post-1857 India. After the 1857 rebellion, the British administration adopted a more conservative approach, abandoning their earlier, somewhat hesitant, support for social reforms.  They feared that any further attempts at social reform might antagonize conservative sections of Indian society, potentially leading to further unrest.  This led to a shift in policy, with the British aligning themselves more closely with orthodox and traditional elements within Indian society.  The British administration consistently prioritized military expenditure and the costs of maintaining a vast administrative apparatus over investment in social services.  This resulted in a stark contrast between the development of social services in Britain and their extremely backward state in India.  Education, sanitation, public health, and other essential services remained severely underdeveloped, negatively impacting the lives of the Indian population.  While some initial labor legislation was introduced in the late 19th century, it was largely driven by the concerns of British manufacturers about competition from Indian industries using cheap labor.  The legislation was insufficient, leaving many workers, particularly those on British-owned plantations, unprotected and exploited. Therefore, option (d) encompassing all three statements is correct.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance in British India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the evolution of the Indian administrative system under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a Supreme Court in Bengal with jurisdiction over all subjects, irrespective of their nationality or origin.
2. Pitt's India Act of 1784 established a Board of Control to oversee the Company's affairs, effectively making the Company a subordinate department of the British state.
3. The Charter Act of 1833 ended the East India Company's monopoly over trade in India completely, including tea and trade with China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Regulating Act of 1773 did establish a Supreme Court in Bengal. However, its jurisdiction was primarily over British subjects within Calcutta and its subordinate factories, creating conflicts with the existing Company courts.  It didn't have jurisdiction over all subjects irrespective of nationality.  The Supreme Court's jurisdiction over Indians was a point of contention and often debated.

Statement 2 is correct. Pitt's India Act of 1784 significantly increased the British government's control over the East India Company, establishing the Board of Control to supervise its civil, military, and revenue affairs. This marked a crucial shift in power dynamics, effectively subordinating the Company to the British state.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Charter Act of 1833 did end the Company's trade monopoly, but it *did not* completely end the Company's monopoly over tea and trade with China. These were retained for a while longer before being eventually relinquished.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cornwallis implemented a system of promotion based solely on seniority to ensure impartiality and reduce corruption within the ICS.
2. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the Company's patronage system.
3. The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 mandated that the ICS examinations be held simultaneously in India and England.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Cornwallis aimed to curb corruption and improve the efficiency of the ICS by implementing a system of promotion primarily based on seniority. This was meant to reduce favoritism and outside influence in appointments. However,  it's crucial to note that while seniority was a major factor, it wasn't the *sole* criterion. Other factors, though less emphasized, did play a role.

Statement 2 is correct. The Charter Act of 1853 was a landmark reform that ended the patronage system of the East India Company and introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS. This was a significant step towards meritocracy, although the examinations were still held in England, creating barriers for Indian candidates.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICS examinations were exclusively held in England, primarily in the English language, creating significant hurdles for Indian aspirants. The simultaneous examination in India and England was a demand of Indian nationalists, but it was not implemented by the Act of 1861.


**3. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Cornwallis, granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, with the revenue fixed permanently.
2. The Ryotwari System, primarily implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct collection of revenue from individual cultivators.
3. The Mahalwari System, prevalent in parts of North India, involved collective responsibility for revenue payment at the village level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct; however, it's crucial to clarify that while the revenue was intended to be permanently fixed, it wasn't always so in practice.  The 'sunset clause' meant that non-payment could lead to the loss of Zamindari rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari System was a significant departure from the Zamindari system, characterized by direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots).  This eliminated the intermediary role of Zamindars.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, differed from both the Permanent Settlement and the Ryotwari System. It involved revenue assessment at the village (mahal) level, with collective responsibility for payment.  The village headman (lambardar) played a crucial role in this system.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the British judicial system in India:**

1. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a unified and standardized judicial system across all of British India.
2. Cornwallis's reforms introduced a separation of revenue and judicial functions, enhancing the independence of the judiciary.
3. The Indian High Courts were established in 1865 by merging the Supreme Court and Sadar Adalats.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Regulating Act of 1773 did establish the Supreme Court in Calcutta, but it did not create a unified judicial system across British India.  The existing judicial structures in different regions continued to operate alongside the Supreme Court, leading to overlaps and inconsistencies.

Statement 2 is correct. Cornwallis's judicial reforms were a significant step in establishing a more structured and independent judiciary.  The separation of revenue and judicial functions was crucial in enhancing the impartiality and efficiency of the judicial process.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1865 reforms created the High Courts at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras by merging the Supreme Court and the Sadar Adalats. This marked a significant step in consolidating and modernizing the British judicial system in India.


**5. With reference to the development of education in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated a significant sum for the promotion of education in India, leading to immediate and widespread improvements in literacy.
2. Lord Macaulay's Minute of 1835 advocated for the exclusive use of English as the medium of instruction in higher education.
3. Wood's Despatch of 1854 emphasized the importance of mass education and the use of vernacular languages at the primary level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Charter Act of 1813 did allocate funds for education, the amount was relatively small (one lakh rupees annually), and its impact wasn't immediate or widespread. The allocation faced delays and controversies regarding its utilization.

Statement 2 is correct. Lord Macaulay's Minute is a landmark document in the history of education in British India. It strongly advocated for English as the medium of instruction in higher education, prioritizing Western knowledge over traditional Indian systems.

Statement 3 is correct. Wood's Despatch of 1854 is considered a landmark document outlining a comprehensive educational policy for India.  It called for a more structured system, including mass education and the use of vernacular languages at the primary level, though the implementation of this ideal was far from complete.


**6.  With reference to British policies towards local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Mayo's resolution of 1870 initiated financial decentralization by granting fixed sums to provincial governments for specific services.
2. Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 advocated for the election of non-official members to local bodies and the election of non-official chairpersons.
3. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) recommended increased provincial control over local bodies to enhance efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Mayo’s resolution was a significant step towards financial decentralization, transferring some financial responsibilities to the provinces.  However, central control remained significant.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Lord Ripon's resolution aimed to increase the representation of non-officials in local bodies, but the extent of elections was limited by the discretion of the officials.  While the resolution promoted the idea of non-official chairpersons, it wasn't a universal mandate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) recommended increased provincial control over local bodies, emphasizing efficiency. This reflected a shift away from the earlier emphasis on decentralization.  The recommendation highlighted concerns about the financial management and effectiveness of local bodies.


**1. With reference to early Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists, while professing loyalty to the British Crown, aimed to transform British rule to approximate national rule.
2.  The Ilbert Bill controversy, though aimed at reducing racial discrimination, ultimately led to its amendment due to strong European opposition.
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his writings and speeches, consistently highlighted the economic drain of British rule on India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of early Indian nationalism.  Statement 1 correctly captures the nuanced approach of moderate nationalists.  They didn't advocate immediate independence but sought gradual reforms within the existing framework, aiming to eventually achieve self-governance. Their professed loyalty wasn't a sign of cowardice but a strategic approach during a time when overt rebellion was deemed impractical.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Ilbert Bill controversy.  While intended to grant Indian judges the power to try Europeans, the bill faced fierce opposition from the European community in India, leading to its amendment and highlighting the deep-seated racial prejudice of the time. This event underscored the limitations of constitutional methods in achieving substantive change. Statement 3 is accurate as Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist leader, extensively documented and publicized the economic exploitation of India under British rule, famously quantifying the "drain of wealth" to Britain. His work was instrumental in raising awareness about the economic dimensions of colonial oppression, a crucial element of the nationalist discourse.


**2. With reference to the methods and strategies of early Indian nationalists, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily relied on mass agitations and open defiance of British authority to achieve their political goals.
2.  The Indian press played a crucial role in shaping public opinion, disseminating nationalist ideology, and critiquing government policies.
3.  The Moderates' political work focused solely on educating British public opinion, neglecting the importance of building a strong domestic public opinion in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The early nationalists, particularly the Moderates, primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation, including petitions, public meetings, and resolutions. While mass agitations did occur later, they weren't the dominant strategy in the early phase.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Indian press, however, served as a vital tool for disseminating nationalist ideas, critiquing government policies, and mobilizing public support.  Newspapers emerged as powerful platforms for expressing Indian perspectives and challenging colonial narratives. Statement 3 is incorrect because the Moderates adopted a two-pronged approach: building domestic public opinion through education and organization, and simultaneously working to influence British public opinion and the Parliament.  They understood that both were necessary to achieve their goals.


**3. With reference to the British government's response to the early nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British government consistently adopted a policy of open and unrestrained hostility towards the early nationalist movement from its inception.
2.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was enacted to control the vernacular press, primarily targeting publications in Indian languages that were critical of government policies.
3.  The British government's policy of "divide and rule" involved solely fostering religious divisions to weaken the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British government was ultimately hostile, its initial response was more nuanced, with attempts to co-opt the movement.  The initial years saw a mixture of cautious observation and limited engagement.  The government's hostility intensified as the movement grew stronger and more assertive. Statement 2 accurately reflects the purpose and impact of the Vernacular Press Act.  This legislation specifically targeted the Indian-language press, which was seen as a major vehicle for disseminating nationalist ideas and criticism of the government. The Act imposed restrictions and censorship to suppress dissent. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the British did exploit religious differences, their "divide and rule" strategy was far broader. They manipulated caste divisions, regional rivalries, and other societal fault lines to weaken the nationalist movement and prevent a unified front against British rule.  It wasn't solely focused on religious divisions.


**4. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in the Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries.
2.  The Permanent Settlement, introduced in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their lands, leading to increased agricultural productivity and peasant welfare.
3.  The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, involved revenue assessment based on the collective assessment of entire villages or groups of villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe key features of the Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems. The Ryotwari system indeed involved direct collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars. This system, however, often led to over-assessment and exploitation of the peasantry, contradicting the claim of increased peasant welfare. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement did grant zamindars proprietary rights, it did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or peasant welfare.  Instead, it resulted in absentee landlordism, exploitation of tenants, and the impoverishment of many cultivators.  The fixed revenue demand, irrespective of crop yields, led to widespread hardship during famines and other calamities. Statement 3 is correct in its description of the Mahalwari system's basis of revenue assessment on villages or groups of villages.  However, this system, too, suffered from its own set of problems, including over-assessment and the potential for exploitation.


**5. With reference to the British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs, but this changed after 1813 due to various factors, including the rise of industrial capitalism in Britain.
2.  The conservative school of thought among British administrators favored minimal changes in Indian society, respecting Indian traditions and culture.
3.  Christian missionaries consistently supported the radical British administrators who advocated for rapid modernization of Indian society, believing it would facilitate the spread of Christianity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately represent aspects of British social and cultural policies. The initial period of non-interference gradually gave way to more interventionist policies after 1813, influenced by the changing economic and ideological landscape in Britain, particularly the rise of industrial capitalism and the spread of various reformist ideas. The conservative approach among British administrators prioritized social stability and often favored gradual change, respecting certain aspects of Indian culture and traditions, though this often served their imperial interests. Statement 3 is incorrect. While missionaries did seek to spread Christianity, their support for British administrators wasn't uniform.  They often aligned themselves with both conservative and radical factions depending on which group they believed would best facilitate their religious goals.  The radical approach towards modernization, while sometimes appealing to missionaries due to its potential to undermine traditional beliefs, also presented challenges to their efforts.  Their support was opportunistic rather than consistently aligned with the radical viewpoint.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at "difficult,"  incorporating misleading information and plausible distractors to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. With reference to the economic impact of British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement system, while aiming to maximize land revenue for the British, inadvertently led to increased insecurity for tenants due to the transferability of land.
2. The introduction of the Ryotwari system resulted in a significant decrease in the number of intermediaries involved in land revenue collection, leading to greater efficiency.
3. The commercialization of Indian agriculture, while increasing the production of cash crops, primarily benefited the intermediaries and exacerbated the indebtedness of the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement system, while intended to secure a stable and predictable revenue stream for the British, had the unintended consequence of creating insecurity for tenants.  The transferability of land allowed zamindars and moneylenders to acquire land from indebted peasants, leading to widespread landlessness and displacement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system, while aiming to eliminate intermediaries, did not necessarily lead to greater efficiency or reduced exploitation. In practice, it often led to high revenue demands placed directly on the cultivators, resulting in similar levels of indebtedness and oppression as under the zamindari system.  The number of intermediaries might have decreased, but the overall burden on the peasantry remained substantial.

Statement 3 is correct.  The commercialization of agriculture, driven by British demand for cash crops like cotton and jute, did lead to increased production. However, this increase primarily benefited intermediaries like traders and moneylenders, while the cultivators often faced volatile prices, indebtedness, and ultimately, impoverishment.  The integration of Indian agriculture into the global market left it vulnerable to international price fluctuations, exacerbating existing economic hardships.



**2. With reference to the deindustrialisation of India under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of cheap, machine-made British textiles led to the widespread ruin of Indian handicraft industries, but this process was largely unintentional and a consequence of natural economic forces.
2.  The high tariffs imposed on Indian textiles in European markets effectively blocked Indian exports, contributing significantly to the decline of Indian industries.  
3. The British actively promoted the development of modern, machine-based industries in India to compensate for the loss of traditional industries, creating a balanced economic transition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The influx of cheap British machine-made goods did devastate Indian handicrafts. However, to say that this was entirely unintentional overlooks the deliberate policies that favored British manufacturers, such as the one-way free trade system.  While some aspects of deindustrialization were due to natural economic competition, the British actively shaped the conditions to favor their own industries.

Statement 2 is correct. The imposition of high tariffs on Indian textiles in British and European markets severely hampered Indian exports and contributed significantly to the decline of these industries. This was a deliberate policy aimed at protecting British industries from competition.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British did not actively promote the development of modern industries in India in a way that compensated for the loss of traditional industries.  Instead, the development of modern industries was largely driven by foreign capital, often in areas that served British interests, and often at the expense of Indian industries.  The transition was far from balanced, resulting in widespread deindustrialization and a colonial economy heavily reliant on raw material exports.


**3. With reference to the economic drain from India under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "economic drain" theory, primarily articulated by Dadabhai Naoroji, argued that a significant portion of India's wealth was transferred to Britain without adequate economic return, hindering India's development.
2.  A major component of this drain consisted of the salaries and pensions of British civil and military officials, which were largely paid from Indian revenues and represented a net outflow of wealth.
3.  The construction of railways in India, while benefiting British industrialists and investors, contributed positively to India's economic development by providing crucial infrastructure and employment opportunities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory is a cornerstone of nationalist economic critique of British rule.  It highlighted the systematic transfer of resources from India to Britain through various mechanisms, resulting in underdevelopment.

Statement 2 is correct.  Salaries and pensions of British officials, paid from Indian revenues and often repatriated to Britain, were a substantial component of the economic drain. This represented a direct transfer of wealth from India without corresponding economic benefits.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the construction of railways did create some employment, it primarily served British economic interests.  The profits from railway construction and operation largely went to British investors, and the railway network primarily facilitated the export of raw materials and the import of British manufactured goods, further harming Indian industries.  The benefits for India were far outweighed by the costs and the overall negative impact on the Indian economy.



**4. With reference to the stages of colonialism in India as identified by Marxist historians, consider the following statements:**

1. The first stage, characterized by merchant capital, focused on monopolizing trade with India and directly appropriating governmental revenues.
2. The second stage, colonialism of free trade, witnessed the integration of India's economy with the British and world capitalist economies through the removal of import duties and increased exports of raw materials.
3. The third stage, marked by foreign investments and international competition, saw a decline in liberal imperialist policies and a rise in reactionary policies aimed at consolidating British control and attracting British capital.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the first stage of colonialism under the East India Company's rule. The focus was primarily on controlling trade and directly extracting wealth through revenue collection, with minimal structural changes to the Indian economy.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the key features of the second stage—the era of free trade.  The dismantling of import duties and the surge in exports of raw materials highlight India's integration into the global capitalist system as a supplier of raw materials to British industries.

Statement 3 is also accurate.  The third stage saw increased foreign investment, but alongside this came a shift towards more reactionary policies.  The increased competition for colonies and the need to secure British dominance led to a tightening of control and policies designed to protect British economic interests, often at the expense of Indian development.  The shift from liberal to more repressive rule is a significant characteristic of this period.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the decline of the Mughal Empire and the rise of regional powers in 18th-century India, a crucial period in Indian history.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the decline of the Mughal Empire:**

1. Aurangzeb's expansionist policies in the Deccan significantly weakened the empire's central authority and financial resources.
2. The absence of a clear law of succession repeatedly led to protracted wars of succession, further destabilizing the empire.
3. The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats was a minor factor in the Mughal decline, primarily caused by internal administrative weaknesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb's long and costly campaigns in the Deccan, while initially yielding some territorial gains, ultimately drained the empire's resources and weakened its administrative structure.  The prolonged military engagements diverted attention and resources from other crucial aspects of governance, creating regional power vacuums that were exploited by ambitious local rulers. This led to a decline in central authority and a weakening of the Mughal hold over various parts of the empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. The lack of a codified law of succession in the Mughal Empire frequently resulted in bitter power struggles among the emperor's sons and other claimants after his death. These conflicts often involved extensive bloodshed and internal strife, draining resources and creating a climate of instability.  This internal conflict undermined the empire's strength and allowed ambitious regional leaders to consolidate their power.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The rise of regional powers was a significant factor in the Mughal decline. While internal administrative weaknesses certainly contributed, the emergence of powerful independent entities like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats directly challenged Mughal authority and actively competed for control over territories and resources. These regional powers not only carved out their own domains but also weakened the Mughals through continuous conflict and rebellion. The weakening of the central government provided the fertile ground for these groups to flourish and assert their independence.  Their rise was a direct consequence of the Mughal's weakening, not a separate, minor factor.


**2. With reference to the 18th-century Indian political landscape, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Buxar (1764) decisively established Maratha dominance in North India.
2.  The Subsidiary Alliance system, implemented by Lord Wellesley, aimed at strengthening the independence of Indian princely states.
3.  The Third Battle of Panipat (1761) significantly weakened the Maratha Confederacy, thereby altering the balance of power in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Buxar (1764) was a decisive victory for the British East India Company against the combined forces of Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Awadh, and Shah Alam II. This victory significantly expanded British influence in North India, not the Marathas. The Maratha's power was mainly in the Deccan and central India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lord Wellesley's Subsidiary Alliance system was designed to bring Indian princely states under British control, not to strengthen their independence.  By stationing British troops within these states' territories and demanding subsidies, the British effectively undermined the states' sovereignty and made them dependent on British military protection.  This system was a key instrument of British expansion in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Third Battle of Panipat (1761) resulted in a devastating defeat for the Maratha Confederacy at the hands of Ahmad Shah Abdali. This loss significantly weakened the Maratha's position, halting their expansionist ambitions and creating a power vacuum that the British were able to exploit in the subsequent decades. The battle significantly altered the balance of power in India, weakening a major rival to the British and allowing British expansion to proceed more easily.


**3. With reference to the administrative reforms undertaken during the British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Cornwallis's reforms emphasized the separation of revenue and judicial functions, aiming for greater administrative efficiency.
2.  The introduction of the Indian Police Act of 1861 established a unified, pan-India police force under a centralized command structure.
3.  The Charter Act of 1853 introduced a system of open competitive examinations for recruitment to the Indian Civil Service, ending the Company's patronage system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Cornwallis's administrative reforms were a landmark in the evolution of British governance in India. A key aspect of these reforms was the separation of revenue and judicial functions. Previously, revenue officials often held judicial powers, leading to conflicts of interest and corruption. Cornwallis's reforms sought to improve efficiency and reduce corruption by assigning these functions to separate, specialized bodies.  This separation laid the foundation for a more structured and impartial judicial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Police Act of 1861 did not create a unified, pan-India police force. While it did standardize police organization and procedures across different regions, it did not establish a single, centralized command structure.  Provincial governments retained considerable autonomy in organizing and managing their police forces.  The police remained under the control of each individual province's administration, although the Act provided guidelines for their uniform organization and procedures.

Statement 3 is correct. The Charter Act of 1853 marked a significant shift in the recruitment process for the Indian Civil Service (ICS).  It abolished the Company's patronage system, replacing it with a system of open competitive examinations. This reform aimed to improve the quality of the ICS by selecting candidates based on merit rather than connections or favoritism. While this was a step towards meritocracy, the exams were held only in England, limiting Indian participation for many years.  The open competitive examinations, however, marked a significant departure from the previous system.

The questions focus on various aspects of the East India Company's establishment and expansion in India, drawing upon details about its interactions with local rulers, military strategies, economic policies, and administrative structures.  The difficulty level aims to challenge candidates with plausible distractors and nuanced factual recall.


**1. With reference to the early establishment of the English East India Company in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Company initially established its headquarters on the west coast at Surat, before shifting it to Bombay in 1687 due to the growing threat from the Maratha power.
2.  The Company's acquisition of the zamindari of three villages – Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur – led to the development of Calcutta.
3.  The Company's early interactions with Mughal authorities were characterized by humble petitions and requests for trading privileges, a contrast to its later assertive policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the English East India Company's early history in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Surat as the initial headquarters and the subsequent move to Bombay in 1687 due to the rising Maratha power. This shift underscores the Company's strategic adaptation to the evolving political landscape. Statement 2 accurately describes the acquisition of the three villages and their transformation into Calcutta, highlighting the Company's gradual acquisition of territorial control.  Statement 3 correctly portrays the Company's initial reliance on negotiation and petitions for trading rights, contrasting with its later adoption of more forceful methods to expand its power and influence.  The evolution from a humble petitioner to a dominant political force is a key theme in understanding the Company's rise.


**2. With reference to the East India Company's administrative practices in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Dual Government" system, implemented in Bengal, involved the Company's control over revenue collection (Diwani) while the Nawab retained nominal control over administration (Nizamat).
2.  The Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765, granted it the right to collect land revenue, significantly increasing its financial power.
3.  Under the Dual Government, the Company's servants were largely accountable to the Nawab of Bengal for their actions and financial dealings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict key features of the East India Company's administration in Bengal.  The Dual Government system, as described in statement 1, effectively vested the Company with substantial financial control while leaving the Nawab with limited administrative authority. This arrangement allowed the Company to amass wealth while mitigating direct responsibility for governance.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the pivotal acquisition of the Diwani rights in 1765, which provided the Company with direct access to Bengal's vast revenues, forming the basis for its future expansion. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Company's servants were largely unaccountable to the Nawab and operated with significant autonomy, leading to widespread corruption and exploitation.  This lack of accountability is a crucial element in understanding the negative consequences of the Dual Government.


**3. With reference to the economic policies of the British in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British pursued a policy of free trade, allowing the unrestricted entry of British manufactured goods into India, which severely impacted Indian handicrafts.
2.  High tariffs imposed by Britain on Indian goods entering the British market severely limited India's ability to export its manufactured goods.
3.  The British promoted the export of raw materials from India to Britain, while simultaneously restricting the development of heavy industries in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect crucial aspects of the British economic policies in India. Statement 1 correctly points out the policy of free trade that allowed British goods to flood the Indian market, leading to the decline of traditional Indian handicrafts. This policy exemplifies the exploitative nature of British economic imperialism. Statement 2 accurately describes the high tariffs imposed by Britain on Indian goods, effectively creating an uneven playing field that hindered India's ability to compete in the global market. This showcases the protectionist measures Britain employed to shield its own industries. Statement 3 correctly identifies the British strategy of promoting raw material exports from India while simultaneously stifling the development of heavy industries. This ensured India remained a supplier of raw materials and a consumer of British manufactured goods. The deliberate suppression of Indian industrialization is a key aspect of understanding British economic exploitation.


**4. With reference to the Anglo-French rivalry in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The First Carnatic War (1740-48) concluded with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which resulted in the return of Madras to the British.
2.  Joseph François Dupleix, the French governor, played a significant role in the Second Carnatic War (1749-54) by intervening in Indian dynastic disputes to expand French influence.
3.  The Battle of Wandiwash (1760) decisively ended the Anglo-French rivalry in India, leading to the dominance of the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe key aspects of the Anglo-French rivalry in India. Statement 1 accurately notes the outcome of the First Carnatic War, with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle leading to the restoration of Madras to the British.  This highlights the initial phase of the rivalry and the fluctuating balance of power. Statement 2 correctly identifies Dupleix's pivotal role in the Second Carnatic War, where his intervention in Indian politics aimed to expand French influence at the expense of the British.  This demonstrates Dupleix's strategic approach and his significant impact on the conflict. Statement 3 correctly highlights the Battle of Wandiwash as a turning point, effectively ending French ambitions for political dominance in India and paving the way for British supremacy. The decisive nature of this battle is a key factor in understanding the shift in the balance of power.


**5. With reference to the early phases of British expansion in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British victory at the Battle of Plassey (1757) marked the beginning of the British conquest of Bengal and significantly enhanced their prestige.
2.  Mir Jafar, initially installed as the Nawab of Bengal by the British, soon became disillusioned with the Company's demands and was replaced by Mir Qasim.
3.  The Battle of Buxar (1764) solidified British control over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, further weakening the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect significant events in the early stages of British expansion in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Battle of Plassey as a pivotal victory that initiated the British conquest of Bengal and significantly boosted their influence and power. This victory is a landmark event in the history of British imperialism. Statement 2 accurately describes the British installation of Mir Jafar and his subsequent replacement by Mir Qasim due to the Company's insatiable demands.  This illustrates the Company's manipulative tactics and its disregard for its Indian collaborators. Statement 3 correctly highlights the Battle of Buxar as a decisive victory that consolidated British control over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, further undermining the authority and power of the Mughal Empire.  This victory solidified British dominion over a crucial region of India.

1. The English East India Company initially acquired Madras as a small coastal territory, securing the right to fortify it and coin money in exchange for a share of customs revenue.
2.  The acquisition of Bombay from Portugal in 1668 significantly strengthened the Company's position on the west coast, primarily due to its strategic port and defensibility against the Maratha threat.
3. The English Company's early ventures in Orissa (1633) and Bengal (1651) initially involved humble requests for trading permissions, but their ambitions soon shifted towards establishing independent political power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the early stages of British expansion in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the initial acquisition of Madras as a relatively small territory, with the Company securing significant rights in exchange for revenue sharing. Statement 2 accurately highlights the strategic importance of Bombay, its superior defensibility compared to Surat, and its role in countering the growing Maratha influence. Statement 3 correctly traces the evolution of the Company's ambitions, from initially seeking trading concessions to eventually aiming for complete political dominance.  The shift in ambition is evidenced by the quotes from the Court of Directors and Governor Aungier, clearly indicating a move beyond mere trade.


**2. With reference to the early conflicts between the British East India Company and the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The sacking of Hugli in 1686 marked the beginning of open hostilities between the Company and the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a conflict that initially demonstrated the Company's overestimation of its military capabilities against the Mughal forces.
2. The war between the Company and Aurangzeb ended with the Company being expelled from its Bengal factories and forced to seek refuge, highlighting the significant military superiority of the Mughal Empire at that time.
3. Following their defeat, the Company adopted a strategy of humble petitions and flattery to regain trading privileges, demonstrating a temporary retreat from their earlier ambitious expansionist plans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the events surrounding the early Anglo-Mughal conflict. Statement 1 correctly identifies the sacking of Hugli as the catalyst for open warfare, and underscores the Company's miscalculation of Mughal strength. Statement 2 accurately describes the consequences of the war for the Company, including their expulsion from Bengal factories and forced retreat. Statement 3 accurately portrays the Company's subsequent shift to a more conciliatory approach, seeking to regain trading rights through diplomacy and appeasement rather than military force, demonstrating a pragmatic adaptation to their military shortcomings.


**3. With reference to the establishment of British settlements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The acquisition of the zamindari of Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur in 1698 marked a significant turning point in the English East India Company’s presence in Bengal, leading to the establishment of Fort William and the future growth of Calcutta.
2. The villages of Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur were acquired through a straightforward purchase from their owners, without any significant conflict or political maneuvering by the Company.
3.  The farman secured from Emperor Farrukh Siyar in 1717 confirmed and expanded the Company's privileges, solidifying their economic and political position in Bengal, Gujarat, and the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Statement 1 correctly identifies the acquisition of the three villages as a crucial step in establishing a fortified settlement (Fort William) and the future city of Calcutta.  The text details the acquisition of zamindari, demonstrating a significant step towards consolidating their presence in Bengal.  Statement 3 accurately describes the farman from Farrukh Siyar, which legally solidified the Company's privileges and expanded its reach geographically.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the text mentions a purchase, it doesn't imply a lack of political maneuvering or conflict. The text implies that  the Company's actions were part of a broader strategy to gain political influence in the region.


**4. With reference to the system of Subsidiary Alliances implemented by Lord Wellesley, consider the following statements:**

1. The Subsidiary Alliance system, while advantageous to the British by enabling them to maintain a large army at the expense of Indian states, also resulted in the disbandment of the protected states' armies and widespread economic hardship.
2. Lord Wellesley's first Subsidiary Treaty was signed with the Peshwa of Pune in 1798, marking a critical step in bringing the Maratha Empire under British influence.
3.  The Nawab of Awadh was forced to sign a Subsidiary Treaty in 1801, resulting in the cession of a significant portion of his territory and the loss of substantial autonomy in internal administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Statement 1 correctly describes the dual nature of the Subsidiary Alliance system; it benefited the British economically and militarily but resulted in the weakening of Indian states and widespread social and economic consequences.  Statement 3 accurately describes the treaty with Awadh, highlighting the loss of territory and internal autonomy.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Wellesley's first Subsidiary Treaty was with the Nizam of Hyderabad, not the Peshwa. The Peshwa signed the treaty of Bassein later.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the timing and the key players involved in the Subsidiary Alliance system.


**5. With reference to the Battle of Plassey and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Plassey (1757) was a decisive victory for the British East India Company, resulting primarily from superior military tactics and the significant defection of Mir Jafar and other key figures in the Nawab's army.
2.  Following the battle, Mir Jafar was installed as the Nawab of Bengal, and the Company secured significant territorial gains and the right to free trade in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.
3.  The immense wealth acquired by the Company and its officials after Plassey was primarily obtained through legitimate trade and taxation, reflecting the Company's commitment to ethical business practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only

Statement 3 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that the wealth acquired after Plassey was gained through extortion, bribes, and the exploitation of the Bengal population, contradicting the claim of ethical business practices.  The question aims to test the candidate's understanding of the historical context and the ethical ambiguities surrounding the Company's actions.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's long reign, despite its harmful policies, left the Mughal administration efficient and the army strong at his death in 1707.
2. Bahadur Shah I's conciliatory policies towards Rajput states like Amber and Marwar were entirely successful in restoring complete Mughal authority.
3. Zulfiqar Khan, during Jahandar Shah's reign, completely reversed Aurangzeb's policies, including abolishing the jizya tax and granting full Maratha demands in the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Aurangzeb's policies had long-term negative consequences, at the time of his death, the Mughal military and administration were still relatively strong, and the dynasty commanded respect.  The text explicitly states this.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Bahadur Shah I's attempts at conciliation with Amber and Marwar were only partially successful. While he reached settlements, the Rajputs' demands for high mansabs and governorship of important provinces were not fully met, indicating incomplete restoration of Mughal control.  The text highlights the resistance faced and the compromises made by Bahadur Shah.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Zulfiqar Khan did reverse some of Aurangzeb's policies,  he did *not* grant the Marathas *all* their demands. The agreement with Shahu in 1711 granted chauth and sardeshmukhi but stipulated that collections would be made by Mughal officials before being handed to the Marathas, indicating continued Mughal involvement and less than full Maratha control. The text clearly outlines the conditions of this agreement.


**2. With reference to the Mughal Emperors after Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Bahadur Shah I, known as ‘Shah-i-Bekhabar’, successfully crushed the Sikh revolt under Banda Bahadur.
2. Jahandar Shah's reign saw the abolition of the jizya tax under the influence of his wazir, Zulfiqar Khan, who also implemented the izara system.
3. Farrukhsiyar, after killing Jahandar Shah with the help of the Sayyid brothers, granted farmans to the British in 1717 and later was dethroned by the same Sayyid brothers in 1719.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Although Bahadur Shah I initially made peace with Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh revolt under Banda Bahadur continued and was not decisively crushed during his reign.  The text notes that the Sikhs recovered the fort of Lohgarh in 1712.

Statement 2 is correct.  Jahandar Shah, under the guidance of Zulfiqar Khan, abolished the jizya tax and introduced the izara system (revenue farming), a significant administrative change.  The text explicitly mentions these actions.

Statement 3 is correct. Farrukhsiyar, with the help of the Sayyid brothers, killed Jahandar Shah.  He later granted farmans (decrees) to the British in 1717 and was subsequently deposed and killed by the Sayyid brothers in 1719, highlighting the shifting power dynamics within the Mughal court. The text supports this sequence of events.


**3. With reference to the external challenges faced by the later Mughals, consider the following statements:**

1. Nadir Shah's invasion in 1738-39 resulted in the annexation of the entire Mughal territory west of the Indus, including Kabul, and the acquisition of the Peacock Throne by the Persian Empire.
2. Ahmad Shah Abdali, after Nadir Shah's death, repeatedly invaded India between 1748 and 1767, but failed to establish a lasting Afghan kingdom in India.
3. The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali, resulted in a decisive Maratha victory and solidified their claim to control over India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nadir Shah's invasion led to the annexation of territories west of the Indus, including Kabul, and the plunder of immense wealth from Delhi, including the Peacock Throne. The text details the extent of Nadir Shah's conquest and plunder.

Statement 2 is correct. Ahmad Shah Abdali's multiple invasions caused significant damage and disruption, but he failed to establish a long-lasting Afghan kingdom in India. His control was temporary and the Punjab eventually fell to Sikh chiefs. The text clarifies the transient nature of Abdali's influence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 resulted in a decisive victory for Ahmad Shah Abdali, significantly weakening the Marathas and ending their ambition of ruling over all of India for a considerable period. This is contrary to what the statement claims.  The text clearly states the outcome of the battle.



**4. Consider the following statements about the causes of the decline of the Mughal Empire:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the reimposition of the jizya tax and destruction of temples, were the primary cause of the empire's downfall.
2. The jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of land to distribute as jagirs, led to increased pressure on the peasantry and widespread discontent.
3. The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, though challenging Mughal authority, did not significantly contribute to the weakening of the empire until after Aurangzeb's death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's religious policies alienated some groups, they were not the *sole* or even the *primary* cause of the empire's decline.  The decline was a complex process involving multiple factors, including economic and administrative weaknesses. The text highlights the multifaceted nature of the decline.

Statement 2 is correct. The jagirdari crisis, stemming from a shortage of land to assign as jagirs, created tensions between the nobility and the peasantry, contributing to the empire's instability.  The text describes this crisis and its consequences.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The rise of regional powers began *during* Aurangzeb's reign and continuously challenged Mughal authority, weakening the empire even before his death. The text makes it clear that these challenges were ongoing throughout Aurangzeb's rule and not solely a post-Aurangzeb phenomenon.


**5. With reference to the regional kingdoms that emerged after the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The independent state of Hyderabad was founded by Nizam-ul-Mulk, who defeated Mubariz Khan in the Battle of Shakr-Kheda in 1724.
2. Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk founded the independent state of Awadh, but his rule was short-lived due to pressure from Nadir Shah.
3. Murshid Quli Khan established the independent state of Bengal, succeeded by Shuja-ud-din, and later Alivardi Khan who completely eliminated Mughal influence in Bengal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nizam-ul-Mulk's victory at Shakr-Kheda in 1724 marked the establishment of the independent state of Hyderabad.  The text supports this account of the founding of Hyderabad.

Statement 2 is correct. Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk did found Awadh, but his rule was indeed cut short due to pressures from Nadir Shah. The text mentions Saadat Khan's suicide under pressure from Nadir Shah.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Murshid Quli Khan founded the independent state of Bengal and was succeeded by Shuja-ud-din, Alivardi Khan did *not* completely eliminate Mughal influence.  Alivardi Khan asserted independence but still paid tribute, showing the continued lingering influence of the Mughals. The text specifies that Alivardi Khan maintained a level of dependence on the Mughal Emperor.


**6. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Agriculture, though technologically backward, was highly productive, ensuring the prosperity of the peasantry.
2.  India's textile industry was renowned globally, with significant exports to various regions, but the shipbuilding industry was in decline.
3. The traditional education system, while widespread at the elementary level, lacked the study of science and technology.

Statement 2 is correct. India's textile industry was indeed internationally renowned, with significant exports.  The text details the extensive textile production and export. The statement about shipbuilding being in decline is incorrect; it was actually flourishing in several regions.

Statement 3 is correct. The traditional education system was widespread at the elementary level, but it neglected science and technology, focusing primarily on literature, religion, and philosophy. The text supports this assessment of the education system's limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Siraj-ud-Daulah's victory at Fort William was not due to superior military strategy but rather to the British underestimation of his forces and his subsequent strategic mistake of allowing the British to escape.  The text indicates that Siraj-ud-Daulah's victory was due to a British error.

Statement 2 is correct. While the British did win, the Battle of Plassey was not solely due to superior fighting ability; it was significantly influenced by treachery and the lack of support from a large part of the Nawab's army.  The text details the role of betrayal in the British victory.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mir Jafar's cooperation did not last.  He was unable to meet the British demands, leading to his replacement by Mir Qasim. The text describes the continuing conflict and exploitation even after Mir Jafar's installment as Nawab.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the historical context.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.


**1. With reference to the early establishment of European trading companies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Portuguese established a factory in Bengal before the English.
2. The Dutch East India Company was formed earlier than the English East India Company.
3. The French East India Company initially focused on establishing a strong presence in Madagascar before expanding to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Portuguese arrived in India significantly earlier than the English, their initial focus in Bengal was later than the English establishment of factories in the region. The English opened their first factories in Orissa in 1633 and were given permission to trade at Hugli in Bengal in 1651, preceding significant Portuguese activity in Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was formed in 1602, while the English East India Company received its charter in 1600.  Therefore, the English company predates the Dutch.

Statement 3 is correct. The French East India Company, established in 1664, initially invested considerable resources in Madagascar before turning its attention towards India.  Their early efforts in India were comparatively less successful initially than the English or Dutch establishments. This initial focus on Madagascar is a key differentiator in the early phases of the French presence in the East Indies.  The other European powers primarily focused on establishing trade networks in India directly.


**2. With reference to the establishment and early activities of the East India Company in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The English East India Company acquired Bombay from the Dutch in 1668.
2. Fort St. George was built by the English in Madras as a small fort around their factory.
3. The initial focus of the East India Company's trade was on spices, and only later did textiles become a major part of their trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The English East India Company acquired Bombay from Portugal, not the Dutch, in 1668 as part of a dowry agreement. The Dutch were primarily focused on the spice trade in the Indonesian archipelago, while the Portuguese held significant territories along the Indian coast.  This difference in territorial holdings and trading priorities is crucial to understanding the early dynamics of European presence in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that the English built Fort St. George in Madras around their factory, which served as their initial fortified presence. The construction of this fort marks a key step in the transition from purely mercantile activities to establishing a more permanent and secure base.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the initial voyages of the East India Company were indeed focused on the Spice Islands (Indonesia), the text highlights that textiles (cotton, silk) were also major commodities of trade from the very beginning. The high demand for Indian textiles in Europe and other parts of Asia ensured that textiles were a central part of their trading strategy from the outset, alongside spices.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Anglo-French rivalry in India:**

1. The First Carnatic War was primarily caused by the direct conflict between the British and French East India Companies.
2. The Battle of Wandiwash decisively ended the Anglo-French rivalry in India, resulting in British supremacy.
3. Joseph Francois Dupleix played a significant role in escalating the Anglo-French rivalry by involving himself in the internal politics of Indian states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Anglo-French rivalry was a backdrop, the First Carnatic War was triggered by events related to the larger European conflict, the War of Austrian Succession, and the seizure of French ships by the British.  The direct conflict between the companies escalated the war but was not the primary cause.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Wandiwash (1760) significantly weakened French power in India, marking a turning point in the Anglo-French rivalry.  While the Treaty of Paris (1763) formally acknowledged French trading rights, their political influence was effectively shattered, paving the way for undisputed British dominance.

Statement 3 is correct. Joseph Francois Dupleix's strategic involvement in the internal politics of Indian states, such as supporting rival claimants to the throne, significantly escalated the Anglo-French conflict. His actions transformed the rivalry from a primarily commercial one into a contest for political control over regions of India, making it a much larger and more significant contest.


**4. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb’s religious policies alienated the Rajput rulers who had been staunch supporters of the Mughal throne.
2. The Maratha expansion, though initially limited to Maharashtra, gradually extended its influence over Malwa and Gujarat.
3. The invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali significantly weakened the Mughal empire's military and economic strength.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb’s rigid religious policies, such as the reimposition of the jizya tax, significantly alienated the Rajput rulers, who had previously been strong allies of the Mughal empire. This loss of support from a powerful and strategically important group significantly weakened the empire's internal cohesion and military strength.

Statement 2 is correct. The Maratha expansion, initially focused on consolidating their control in Maharashtra, steadily expanded its reach into Malwa and Gujarat. This expansion, though incremental, effectively chipped away at the Mughal empire's territorial control and influence in key regions.

Statement 3 is correct.  The devastating invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali inflicted significant damage on the Mughal empire.  These invasions not only weakened the empire's military capabilities but also severely depleted its economic resources, leaving it vulnerable to further internal challenges and external threats.  The scale of looting and destruction caused by these invasions is well-documented.


**5. With reference to the British conquest of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Subsidiary Alliance system, perfected by Lord Wellesley, involved the stationing of British troops in Indian states in exchange for a subsidy and the cession of territories.
2. The Doctrine of Lapse, primarily associated with Lord Dalhousie, led to the annexation of several Indian states based on the absence of a male heir.
3. The annexation of Awadh was primarily justified by the British on grounds of misgovernance and financial mismanagement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Wellesley's refined Subsidiary Alliance system was a key instrument in the British expansion. It involved placing British troops in Indian states under the guise of protection, but in reality, it created a dependent relationship, often resulting in the cession of territories or the payment of hefty subsidies. This system effectively undermined the sovereignty of the allied states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Doctrine of Lapse, actively pursued by Lord Dalhousie, provided a convenient pretext for annexing several Indian states.  The policy stated that in the absence of a direct male heir, the state would 'lapse' to the British East India Company, regardless of the existence of adopted heirs. This policy was a blatant violation of established practices and legal norms and resulted in the annexation of several states.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the British cited misgovernance and financial mismanagement in Awadh as justification for its annexation under Lord Dalhousie, this was largely a pretext. The annexation was primarily driven by strategic considerations and a desire to consolidate British control over a crucial region. The actual level of misgovernance was often exaggerated to justify the annexation.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the Mughal administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Mir Bakhshi* was primarily responsible for revenue collection in the Mughal Empire.
2.  The *jagirdari* system, while contributing to the Mughal Empire's strength, also led to internal conflicts due to land disputes and power struggles among nobles.
3.  The *Amil*, a revenue official, directly reported to the village headman in the Mughal revenue system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *Mir Bakhshi* was a high-ranking official in the Mughal administration primarily responsible for the military pay and accounts, not revenue collection. Revenue collection was handled by various officials, including *Amils* and *Faujdars*, depending on the level of administration.

Statement 2 is correct. The *jagirdari* system, while crucial for maintaining the Mughal army and administering vast territories, often caused internal conflicts.  The assignment of *jagirs* (land grants) to nobles created competition and rivalries, especially during periods of weak central authority. Disputes over land ownership and control led to power struggles that weakened the empire's stability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The *Amil*, as a revenue official, did not report to the village headman.  The hierarchy was more complex, with *Amils* reporting to higher-level officials within the revenue administration structure. The village headman had his own responsibilities and jurisdiction within the village, but not over the *Amil*.  The Mughal revenue system was a multi-tiered structure with various levels of officials and reporting lines.



**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Services under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Cornwallis implemented a system of open competitive examinations for recruitment into the Indian Civil Service (ICS) to ensure meritocracy and transparency.
2.  The establishment of the Haileybury College in England aimed to provide specialized training to ICS recruits, focusing on Indian languages and administrative practices.
3.  The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861, while theoretically opening up the ICS to Indians, imposed stringent conditions such as age limits and examination location, effectively limiting Indian participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lord Cornwallis is credited with reforming the civil service, introducing measures to curb corruption and improve efficiency. However, open competitive examinations were not introduced during his tenure. The system of open competitive examinations for the ICS was introduced much later, in 1853, by the Charter Act of 1853.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Haileybury College was established to train ICS recruits, but its curriculum primarily focused on classical education and British administrative systems.  Specialized training in Indian languages and administrative practices was not a central focus of its curriculum. This limited the understanding of the recruits about the local context.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did make a provision that theoretically allowed Indians to join the ICS, but the conditions imposed were highly restrictive.  The examinations were held in England, using the English language and focusing on classical subjects.  The age limits were also set lower, making it difficult for many Indians to qualify. This effectively ensured European dominance within the ICS for many years.



**3. With reference to the impact of the 1857 Revolt on British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt led to the complete dismantling of the East India Company and the direct assumption of control over India by the British Crown.
2.  Post-1857, the British adopted a policy of complete assimilation, aiming to integrate Indian administrative structures and systems fully with British systems.
3. The British increased their reliance on the princely states, viewing them as a bulwark against future uprisings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The 1857 Revolt did lead to the dissolution of the East India Company and the transfer of power to the British Crown, but it wasn't a complete dismantling. The Crown took over the existing administrative structure and personnel.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British did not pursue a policy of complete assimilation after 1857. Instead, they adopted a more cautious and pragmatic approach, maintaining many aspects of the existing Indian administrative systems while strengthening their control.  They continued to govern through a combination of direct rule and indirect rule through princely states.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1857 Revolt significantly altered British policy towards the princely states.  Recognizing their loyalty during the rebellion and their potential as a buffer against future uprisings, the British strengthened their alliances with the princely states, providing them with increased autonomy in exchange for loyalty and support.



**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the evolution of local self-government in British India:**

1.  Lord Mayo's reforms introduced financial decentralization, transferring certain administrative responsibilities and financial resources to provincial governments.
2.  Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 advocated for the establishment of local bodies with elected non-official majorities, marking a significant step towards popular participation in local governance.
3. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) recommended enhanced powers for village panchayats, including judicial functions and control over local resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Mayo's reforms aimed at financial decentralization to improve efficiency and reduce the burden on the central government. It involved transferring certain administrative responsibilities and resources to the provinces.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 is a landmark in the history of local self-government in India. It advocated for greater participation of non-officials in local bodies, although the extent of elected representation varied in practice. It laid the foundation for local self-government.

Statement 3 is correct. The Royal Commission on Decentralization (1908) emphasized the importance of strengthening village panchayats and empowering them with greater responsibilities, including judicial functions and control over local resources. This was aimed at improving local governance.



**5. With reference to the administrative changes in British India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act for the Better Government of India, 1858, abolished the dual system of control over the East India Company that had existed under Pitt's India Act of 1784.
2. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 introduced elected representatives from various communities in the Imperial Legislative Council, marking a significant step towards representative government.
3. Post-1857, the British significantly increased the number of Indians in high administrative positions to foster greater cooperation and reduce discontent among the Indian population.

Statement 1 is correct.  The Act of 1858 ended the dual control system established by Pitt's India Act, placing direct control of Indian affairs under the British Crown through a Secretary of State for India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did introduce non-official members into the legislative councils, but these members were nominated, not elected.  It did not mark a significant step towards representative government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there was a gradual increase in the number of Indians in administrative positions over time, it was a slow process and did not significantly alter the dominance of British officials in high administrative positions immediately after the 1857 revolt.  The British primarily aimed to maintain their control and dominance.


**6. With reference to the Mughal Empire's decline, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's long and costly Deccan campaigns severely depleted the empire's resources and weakened its administrative structure.
2. The absence of a clear and consistent law of succession in the Mughal Empire led to frequent and debilitating wars of succession.
3. The rise of regional powers such as the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats significantly contributed to the weakening of the Mughal Empire's central authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb's prolonged campaigns in the Deccan drained the empire's resources, both human and financial. This weakened the central government and made it vulnerable to internal and external challenges.

Statement 2 is correct. The lack of a clear rule of succession in the Mughal Empire created uncertainty and led to frequent power struggles among the royal family members. These wars of succession disrupted the administration, weakened the army, and diverted resources away from other important tasks.

Statement 3 is correct. The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats challenged the Mughal Empire's authority. These regional powers gradually asserted their independence, carving out their own territories and weakening the empire's control over vast areas.


**7. With reference to the British policy towards princely states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Doctrine of Lapse, implemented by Lord Dalhousie, led to the annexation of several princely states based on the absence of a natural heir.
2.  Post-1857, the British abandoned their policy of annexation and adopted a policy of protecting the princely states' integrity in exchange for their loyalty.
3. The Butler Committee (1927) recommended the transfer of paramountcy from the British Crown to an Indian government responsible to an Indian legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Doctrine of Lapse was a key instrument used by Lord Dalhousie to annex several princely states.  The policy stated that if a ruler died without a natural male heir, the state would be annexed by the British, despite the common practice of adoption.

Statement 2 is correct. After the 1857 revolt, the British changed their approach to the princely states. They abandoned the aggressive annexation policy and adopted a policy of preserving the existing states' integrity in exchange for their loyalty and support. This was a strategic move to maintain stability and control.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Butler Committee (1927) did not recommend the transfer of paramountcy to an Indian government. Instead, it emphasized the continued supremacy of paramountcy in the British Crown and the necessity for the consent of the princely states before any transfer of power.  The British maintained control over the princely states until Indian independence.


**8. With reference to the judicial system in British India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Warren Hastings established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, which had jurisdiction over all British subjects, including Indians.
2.  Lord Cornwallis' reforms introduced the separation of revenue and judicial functions, marking a crucial step in establishing an independent judiciary.
3.  The Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) were enacted before the 1857 revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Warren Hastings established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, which had jurisdiction over all British subjects, though its relationship with other courts was often contentious.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lord Cornwallis' judicial reforms were significant in separating revenue and judicial functions, enhancing the judiciary's independence and reducing the collector's power. This separation aimed to ensure fair and impartial justice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the codification of laws began under Macaulay, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) were enacted *after* the 1857 revolt, in 1860 and 1861 respectively.  The revolt highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and codified legal system.


**9. With reference to the military in British India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British Army in India before 1857 consisted of two distinct forces: the Queen's Army and the Company's Army.
2.  Post-1857, the British reorganized the Indian Army to reduce the proportion of Indian soldiers, particularly those from regions that participated actively in the revolt.
3.  The British consistently promoted Indians to the highest ranks in the Indian Army, irrespective of their caste or community, to ensure meritocracy and loyalty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Before 1857, the British Army in India comprised the Queen's Army (directly under the British Crown) and the Company's Army (under the East India Company).  This dual structure reflected the complex power dynamics of the time.

Statement 2 is correct. After the 1857 revolt, the British significantly reorganized the Indian Army.  They reduced the proportion of Indian soldiers, particularly those from communities perceived as having participated more actively in the revolt.  This was a deliberate strategy to prevent future rebellions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British did not promote Indians to the highest ranks in the army.  They maintained a strict hierarchy with key positions reserved for British officers, reflecting their colonial control and power.  The promotion of Indian soldiers was heavily influenced by caste and community considerations, reflecting the British "divide and rule" policy.


**10. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The agricultural sector, while employing a large portion of the population, remained technologically backward, leading to low productivity and widespread poverty among peasants.
2.  India's textile industry enjoyed a significant global presence, exporting high-quality textiles to various parts of the world, but this industry faced challenges due to the increasing competition from British manufactured goods.
3.  The education system in 18th-century India was primarily traditional and did not encompass the study of modern sciences and technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Agriculture in 18th-century India was largely traditional and technologically backward. This resulted in low productivity, making the majority of the peasant population vulnerable to poverty and exploitation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian textile industry was a major force in the global economy, exporting fine cotton and silk fabrics worldwide. However, it faced increasing competition from British manufactured goods, which were cheaper and often subsidized.

Statement 3 is correct. The education system in 18th-century India was primarily traditional, focusing on religious and classical studies.  Modern sciences and technologies were largely absent from the curriculum, hindering the country's technological progress and its ability to compete with the West.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by its correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the early stages of British involvement in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. Siraj-ud-Daulah's demand that the English trade on the same basis as under Murshid Quli Khan was a key factor leading to conflict.
2. The English fortifying Calcutta without the Nawab's permission was perceived as a direct challenge to his sovereignty.
3. The French, unlike the English, complied with Siraj-ud-Daulah's order to demolish their fortifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect events leading up to the Battle of Plassey.  Siraj-ud-Daulah's demand for equitable trade practices, mirroring those under Murshid Quli Khan, was indeed a major point of contention.  The English refusal stemmed from their growing power after defeating the French and their assessment of the weakness of Indian states.  Their subsequent fortification of Calcutta without permission directly challenged Siraj-ud-Daulah's authority as an independent ruler, a crucial factor escalating the conflict.  The French, unlike the English, did comply with the Nawab's order to dismantle their fortifications, highlighting the contrasting approaches of the two European powers and the English ambition to dominate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete representations of the historical context.


**2. With reference to the Battle of Plassey and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory for the English, with minimal casualties on their side compared to the Nawab's army.
2.  Mir Jafar's betrayal played a significant role in the English victory at Plassey.
3.  Following Plassey, the English obtained undisputed rights to free trade in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, and the zamindari of the 24 Parganas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Battle of Plassey was indeed a decisive victory for the British East India Company, characterized by significantly fewer casualties on their side than on the Nawab's. This disparity was largely due to the treachery of Mir Jafar and other commanders who either refused to fight or actively aided the English. The consequences of the battle included the granting of extensive privileges to the Company, encompassing undisputed free trade in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, along with the acquisition of the 24 Parganas zamindari.  The other options fail to encompass the full extent of the battle's impact and the role of internal treachery.


**3. With reference to the policies of Lord Dalhousie, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Lapse was a key instrument used by Dalhousie to annex several Indian states.
2. Dalhousie's annexation of Awadh was primarily justified on the grounds of misgovernance and the need for reform.
3. The annexation of Berar was driven by the British desire to control India's cotton production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate descriptions of Dalhousie's policies. The Doctrine of Lapse, which led to the annexation of several states upon the death of a ruler without a natural heir, was a significant tool employed by Dalhousie to expand British territory. The annexation of Awadh, while presented as a measure to address misgovernance, was also driven by economic interests and strategic considerations.  The acquisition of Berar, a significant cotton-producing region, directly reflects the British aim to control India's raw material resources for their textile industry.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the entirety of Dalhousie's annexationist policies and their motivations.


**4. With reference to the administrative changes after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act for Better Government of India, 1858, transferred the power to govern India from the East India Company to the British Crown.
2. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 significantly increased the power and autonomy of provincial legislatures.
3.  Lord Mayo's financial decentralization measures of 1870 led to a substantial increase in provincial autonomy and Indian participation in administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. The 1858 Act did indeed transfer governance from the East India Company to the Crown, marking a significant shift in the structure of British rule in India.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while the 1861 Act established legislative councils in provinces, these councils had limited powers and did not substantially increase provincial autonomy.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; Lord Mayo's financial decentralization measures aimed at efficiency and revenue management, but they did not lead to a significant increase in provincial autonomy or Indian participation in administration. The other options are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3.


**5. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1.  Cornwallis implemented reforms aimed at curbing corruption within the ICS, including raising salaries and prohibiting private trade.
2. The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the Company’s patronage system.
3. The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 made it significantly easier for Indians to enter the higher echelons of the ICS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Cornwallis did introduce reforms to tackle corruption within the civil service, including measures to increase salaries and restrict private trade by officials. The 1853 Charter Act did indeed replace the patronage system with open competitive examinations. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The 1861 Act, while theoretically opening the service to Indians, maintained significant barriers, such as holding the examinations in England and in English, making it extremely difficult for Indians to gain entry into the higher ranks. The other options are thus inaccurate because of the falsity of statement 3.


**6. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, granted proprietary rights to zamindars over their lands.
2. The Ryotwari System, primarily implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators.
3. The Mahalwari System, prevalent in parts of North India, involved revenue assessment at the village or group of village level (mahal).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of the British land revenue systems in India. The Permanent Settlement did grant proprietary rights to zamindars, although this had significant consequences for the peasantry. The Ryotwari System focused on direct collection from individual cultivators, while the Mahalwari System assessed revenue at the village or group of villages level.  Therefore, option (c) is the only one that accurately reflects the characteristics of all three systems.


**7.  With reference to British judicial developments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Warren Hastings established the District Diwani Adalats to handle civil disputes, applying Hindu law to Hindus and Muslim law to Muslims.
2. The Supreme Court established in Calcutta under the Regulating Act of 1773 had a clear and uncontested jurisdiction.
3. Lord Cornwallis's reforms led to the separation of revenue and judicial administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  Warren Hastings did establish the District Diwani Adalats with the specified legal frameworks. Lord Cornwallis's reforms did bring about the crucial separation of revenue and judicial functions. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction in Calcutta often clashed with other courts, creating considerable conflict and ambiguity.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incomplete or inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the British policy of Subsidiary Alliances, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy involved the disbandment of the armies of protected Indian states.
2.  The Subsidiary Alliance system was advantageous to the British as it allowed them to maintain a large army at the cost of the Indian states.
3. Tipu Sultan of Mysore readily accepted a Subsidiary Alliance with the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of the Subsidiary Alliance system. The policy did lead to the disbandment of many Indian armies, creating widespread unemployment and social disruption.  The system was indeed advantageous for the British, allowing them to maintain a large military presence at the expense of the Indian states.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Tipu Sultan fiercely resisted British control and never accepted a Subsidiary Alliance.  His resistance ultimately led to his defeat and death.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the key features of this policy.


**9. With reference to the post-1857 administrative structure in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Viceroy was increasingly subordinated to the Secretary of State for India based in London.
2. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 created powerful provincial legislatures with significant autonomy.
3. Financial decentralization measures, while implemented, did not result in genuine provincial autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  After 1857, the Viceroy's power was increasingly subject to the control of the Secretary of State in London, reflecting the tightening of British control. Financial decentralization did occur, but it was primarily aimed at improving efficiency and revenue collection, not at granting genuine autonomy to the provinces. Statement 2 is incorrect; the legislative councils created by the 1861 Act had limited powers and did not provide significant provincial autonomy.  The other options are thus incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2.


**10. With reference to the British policy towards educated Indians, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially commended educated Indians for their refusal to participate in the 1857 Revolt.
2.  The British became hostile towards educated Indians when they began to utilize their knowledge to analyze British rule and advocate for greater Indian participation in administration.
3. The British actively promoted higher education in India to cultivate a loyal and compliant Indian elite.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate reflections of the British attitude towards educated Indians. Initially, the British were favorably inclined towards those who did not participate in the 1857 rebellion. However, this changed as educated Indians began to use their knowledge to critique British rule and demand greater participation in governance, leading to a hostile response from the British authorities. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the British did promote education, it was not solely to cultivate a loyal elite; their motives were complex and included elements of both cooperation and control.  Therefore, only option (a) correctly identifies the shifting British policy towards educated Indians.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the British conquest of India and the preceding period.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Subsidiary Alliance system implemented by Lord Wellesley:**

1. The system aimed at consolidating British power in India by subordinating Indian states without outright annexation.
2.  Under this system, Indian rulers were compelled to maintain a British army within their territories, leading to financial strain and the disbanding of their own armies.
3. The Subsidiary Alliance system always guaranteed non-interference in the internal affairs of allied states, preserving their sovereignty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Lord Wellesley's Subsidiary Alliance system was a key element of his expansionist policy.  Statement 1 is correct; the system aimed at bringing Indian states under British influence without direct annexation, initially presented as a protective measure.  Statement 2 is also correct; a crucial aspect of the system was the stationing of a British army within the allied state's territory, funded by the ruler. This significantly burdened the state's finances, often exceeding its capacity, and led to the disbanding or weakening of the ruler's own military forces, leaving them dependent on the British.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the British promised non-interference in internal affairs, this was rarely upheld in practice. British Residents stationed at the courts of allied rulers frequently interfered in the state's internal administration, gradually eroding their sovereignty.  The system's ultimate goal was to establish British paramountcy and exert control over Indian states' foreign and defense policies.


**2. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the reimposition of the jizya tax, alienated significant sections of the Hindu population, weakening the empire's base.
2. The Jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of land to grant as Jagirs and increasing financial strain on the empire, contributed significantly to its weakening.
3. The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, who challenged Mughal authority and carved out independent territories, was unrelated to the empire's decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The decline of the Mughal Empire was a complex process with multiple contributing factors. Statement 1 accurately reflects Aurangzeb's rigid religious policies, particularly the reimposition of the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which alienated large segments of the Hindu population, who were previously key supporters of the empire. This contributed to widespread revolts and weakened the empire's internal cohesion. Statement 2 correctly points out the Jagirdari crisis, a significant administrative and economic problem.  The shortage of land to be assigned as Jagirs, coupled with the increasing demands of the nobility and the resulting financial strain on the imperial treasury, severely hampered the empire's ability to maintain its authority and effectively govern its vast territories. Statement 3 is incorrect; the rise of regional powers was a direct consequence of the weakening Mughal authority.  These powers exploited the empire's internal instability and successfully established their independent kingdoms, signifying the fragmentation of the Mughal Empire.  The combined effect of these internal weaknesses and the rise of regional powers significantly accelerated the empire's decline.


**3. With reference to the First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-1782), consider the following statements:**

1. The war began primarily due to the ambitions of Raghunath Rao, a Maratha chief.
2. The Treaty of Salbai, which concluded the war, resulted in a decisive victory for the British East India Company.
3. The war saw a temporary unification of various Maratha chiefs under the Peshwa and Nana Phadnis against the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The First Anglo-Maratha War was a complex conflict with multiple causes and consequences. Statement 1 is correct; the war was significantly influenced by the actions and ambitions of Raghunath Rao, a Maratha chief, whose intrigues and alliances with the British contributed to the outbreak of hostilities. Statement 3 is also correct; a defining characteristic of this war was the temporary unification of several Maratha chiefs under the leadership of the Peshwa and his minister, Nana Phadnis, against the common threat of the British.  This unity, however, was short-lived, and internal divisions among the Maratha chiefs ultimately hindered their ability to effectively counter the British. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Treaty of Salbai, which concluded the war, did not represent a decisive victory for either side. The treaty essentially restored the status quo ante bellum, meaning that territorial gains made by either side during the war were returned, and neither party achieved a clear military or political advantage.  The war, though inconclusive, significantly shaped the future relations between the British and the Marathas, setting the stage for subsequent conflicts.



**4.  Consider the following statements regarding 18th-century India:**

1.  The "Dadni" system was primarily associated with textile production, involving advances to weavers and the purchase of their output.
2.  The "Dastak" was a land document conferring ownership rights.
3.  The Battle of Plassey (1757) marked a decisive turning point in the British conquest of India, significantly enhancing their power and prestige.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 18th century in India witnessed significant economic and political changes. Statement 1 is correct; the "Dadni" system was a crucial part of the textile industry's organization.  It involved merchants providing advances to weavers to produce textiles, subsequently purchasing their output. This system, while facilitating production, also led to the exploitation of weavers due to the often unfavorable terms imposed by the merchants. Statement 2 is incorrect; the "Dastak" was not a land document.  It was a trade permit issued by the Mughal authorities granting exemption from internal customs duties. The British East India Company misused these permits extensively, leading to conflict with Indian rulers.  Statement 3 is correct; the Battle of Plassey represents a pivotal moment in the British conquest of India. The relatively easy victory over Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, significantly boosted British prestige and provided them with control over the wealthy province of Bengal, providing them with crucial resources for further expansion. The Battle of Plassey established the British as a major power in India, opening the path for their eventual dominance.


**5. With reference to the policies pursued by the British in India during the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Dalhousie's policy of annexation aimed at extending direct British rule over as much territory as possible, justified by the argument of superior British administration.
2.  The annexation of Sindh was primarily driven by commercial considerations related to the river Indus and the desire to secure a vital trade route.
3.  The conquest of Punjab was solely a result of the British desire to check the expansion of Russian influence in Central Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

British policies in 19th-century India were characterized by expansionism and consolidation of power. Statement 1 is correct; Lord Dalhousie's aggressive annexation policy aimed at bringing more Indian territories under direct British control.  While he cited the inefficiency and corruption of Indian rulers as justification, the underlying motive was to expand British power and access to resources.  Statement 2 is also correct; the annexation of Sindh was motivated by several factors including the strategic importance of the Indus River for trade and communication, providing access to valuable trade routes. The British also sought to control the region to secure their position against potential Russian advances in Central Asia. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Anglo-Russian rivalry was a significant factor influencing British actions in the region, the conquest of Punjab was not solely driven by the need to check Russian influence.  Internal instability within the Sikh kingdom following the death of Ranjit Singh, coupled with British ambitions for territorial expansion, played a crucial role in the events leading to the annexation of Punjab.  The British used the internal conflicts within Punjab as a pretext to intervene and ultimately annex the territory.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to social reform movements in 19th and early 20th century India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to 19th-century social reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jyotirao Phule's contribution to women's education included establishing the first girls' school in Pune in 1851.
2.  Karsandas Mulji's Satya Prakash, published in 1852, primarily advocated for widow remarriage in Gujarat.
3.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known as Lokahitawadi, championed the reorganization of Indian society based solely on traditional Hindu principles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Jyotirao Phule and his wife Savitribai Phule were pioneers in women's education in Maharashtra, they started their first girls' school in Pune in 1848, not 1851.  However, their contribution to promoting girls' education remains a significant fact. Statement 2 is correct. Karsandas Mulji's Satya Prakash actively advocated for widow remarriage within the Gujarati community. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gopal Hari Deshmukh, or Lokahitawadi, advocated for the reorganization of Indian society on rational principles and modern humanistic and secular values, not solely on traditional Hindu principles. His vision encompassed a broader, more inclusive approach to social reform.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are partially correct, making option (c) the most appropriate choice.  The slight inaccuracy in statement 1 highlights the need for precise factual recall in UPSC exams.



**2. With reference to the social reform movements in British India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Widow Remarriage Association, founded in the 1850s, was solely spearheaded by Vishnu Shastri Pandit without any other significant contributors.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's social reform efforts were primarily focused on reforming Zoroastrian religion and advocating for women's legal rights within the Parsi community.
3.  The Satya Shodhak Samaj, an anti-caste movement in Maharashtra, was primarily focused on the upliftment of tribal communities in Bihar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Vishnu Shastri Pandit was a founder of the Widow Remarriage Association, other prominent figures like Karsandas Mulji also played significant roles in promoting widow remarriage. Statement 2 is largely correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's social reform work significantly focused on Zoroastrian religious reform and advocating for Parsi women's legal rights, particularly concerning inheritance and marriage laws. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Satya Shodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, was an anti-caste movement primarily focused on the upliftment of lower castes in Maharashtra, not tribal communities in Bihar.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical facts, making (b) the correct option.  The incorrect statements highlight the importance of understanding the specific focus and geographical reach of different social reform movements.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements of 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmo Samaj unequivocally supported the practice of sati throughout its existence.
2.  The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Syed Ahmed Khan, emphasized the reconciliation of Islamic teachings with the demands of the modern age.
3.  Raja Rammohan Roy primarily focused on advocating for social reforms while largely ignoring religious reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Brahmo Samaj vehemently opposed the practice of sati and actively campaigned for its abolition.  Statement 2 is correct. The Aligarh Movement, a significant reform movement within the Muslim community, aimed to modernize Islamic thought and education while retaining core religious principles.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Raja Rammohan Roy's reform efforts encompassed both social and religious spheres. He championed monotheism, criticized idolatry, and worked for the abolition of sati, demonstrating a holistic approach to reform.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer. The incorrect statements highlight the importance of understanding the nuanced positions and comprehensive nature of the various reform movements.


**4. With reference to women's rights and social reform in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Age of Consent Act of 1891 raised the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 years.
2.  The Rukhmabai case of 1884 primarily revolved around women's right to education and the age of consent.
3.  Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was solely responsible for the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Age of Consent Act of 1891 set the minimum age of marriage for girls to 12, not 18.  Statement 2 is largely correct. The Rukhmabai case highlighted issues of child marriage, women's right to refuse marriage, and the age of consent.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a crucial role in advocating for the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, it was a collective effort involving various reformers and social activists.  Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially correct, making (b) the correct option. The other options demonstrate common misconceptions regarding specific legislation and the contributions of individual reformers.  The inaccuracies highlight the need for precise and detailed knowledge of these historical events for UPSC success.


**5. Consider the following statements about the early phases of the Indian working-class movement:**

1. The first major strike by railway workers in India occurred in 1899 and received significant support from nationalist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
2.  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was founded in 1920 with Lala Lajpat Rai as its first president, primarily advocating for class collaboration with the capitalist class.
3. The Trade Disputes Act of 1929 aimed to promote workers' participation in the management of industries and curb arbitrary powers of management.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway strike of 1899 was a significant early example of worker mobilization and received support from nationalist newspapers like Kesari. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Lala Lajpat Rai was the first president of AITUC, it did not primarily advocate for class collaboration with capitalists; it aimed to improve worker conditions through various means. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Trade Disputes Act of 1929 aimed to regulate industrial disputes through established procedures and boards, not to promote worker participation in management. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The incorrect statements highlight the complexities of the early Indian working-class movement and the need to avoid generalizations about its goals and strategies.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of 19th and early 20th century India.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the impact of the rediscovery of the past on Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The rediscovery of ancient Indian texts and philosophies fueled a sense of national pride and identity, challenging the perceived superiority of Western culture.
2. This rediscovery exclusively promoted a unified vision of Indian history, minimizing internal religious and caste differences.
3.  The emphasis on a glorious past sometimes led to a neglect of contemporary social issues and a romanticized view of history, hindering progressive reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rediscovery of ancient Indian texts and philosophies, particularly during the 19th-century reform movements, played a crucial role in fostering a sense of national pride and identity.  This counteracted the colonial narrative that portrayed Indian culture as inferior to Western civilization.  Reformers like Swami Vivekananda effectively used this historical narrative to bolster Indian self-esteem and inspire nationalist sentiment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rediscovery of the past did not promote a uniformly unified vision of Indian history.  Different interpretations of the past emerged, often highlighting specific aspects of the past that reinforced particular religious or caste identities. This contributed to both the growth of nationalism and, unfortunately, communalism, as different groups selectively appropriated elements of the historical narrative to serve their own interests. The emphasis on a singular, unified narrative ignores the complex and often conflicting interpretations of India's past.

Statement 3 is correct. The focus on a glorious past sometimes overshadowed the need for addressing contemporary social problems.  A romanticized view of the past, overlooking its complexities and injustices, could hinder progressive social reform. This selective focus on a idealized past sometimes prevented a critical engagement with present-day challenges and inequalities.  The emphasis on a utopian past sometimes distracted from the urgent need for socio-economic and political change.


**2. With reference to the Ilbert Bill, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ilbert Bill aimed to grant Indian judges the authority to try European British citizens for certain offenses.
2. The bill’s passage faced significant opposition from the British community in India, leading to its amendment.
3. The controversy surrounding the Ilbert Bill highlighted the racial prejudices inherent in the colonial legal system and fueled nationalist sentiment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ilbert Bill, introduced in 1883, proposed to remove the existing restriction that prevented Indian judges from trying European British citizens in certain cases.  This was a significant step towards achieving legal equality.

Statement 2 is correct. The bill generated substantial opposition from the British community in India, who viewed it as a threat to their privileged position within the colonial legal system. This opposition resulted in the bill being amended, significantly diluting its initial provisions. The amendment ensured that Indian judges could only try European British citizens with the consent of the higher authorities.

Statement 3 is correct. The controversy surrounding the Ilbert Bill exposed the deep-seated racial prejudices that characterized the colonial legal framework.  The strong reaction from the British community underscored the inequalities embedded within the colonial system.  The incident served as a catalyst for intensifying nationalist sentiments, as it highlighted the discriminatory nature of British rule and fueled demands for greater legal and political autonomy for Indians.


**3. With reference to Dadabhai Naoroji, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji is known for his pioneering work on the economic drain of India under British rule.
2. He was a prominent member of the Indian National Congress and served as its president on multiple occasions.
3.  Naoroji's contributions were primarily confined to the economic sphere; he had minimal involvement in social reform movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's seminal work, *Poverty and Un-British Rule in India*, meticulously documented the economic exploitation of India under British rule. He quantified the "drain of wealth" from India to Britain, which became a central argument for Indian nationalists advocating for self-governance. His analysis of the economic imbalance caused by British policies is considered a cornerstone of early nationalist economic thought.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji was a founding member of the Indian National Congress and served as its president on three separate occasions (1886, 1893, and 1906).  His leadership within the Congress was instrumental in shaping its early political trajectory.  His long tenure as an active member and president shows his considerable influence on the organization's development and its approach to political reform.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Naoroji is best known for his economic analysis, he was also actively involved in social reform movements. He was a founding member of the Parsi Law Association, which worked to reform Parsi personal laws, advocating for better legal rights for Parsi women, especially in inheritance and marriage.  This demonstrates his broader commitment to social justice alongside his focus on economic issues.


**4. With reference to the Indian Association, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Association was a precursor to the Indian National Congress, playing a significant role in shaping early nationalist thought.
2.  It primarily focused on issues of local self-governance and did not actively engage with broader national political issues.
3. The Indian Association was founded solely by Bengali intellectuals and had limited participation from other regions of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Association, founded in 1876 in Calcutta, is widely recognized as one of the key organizations that paved the way for the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Leaders from the Indian Association played a crucial role in shaping the early political strategies and ideology of the Congress.  The Association's advocacy for self-governance and its experience in organizing political actions provided a foundation for the Congress's later growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indian Association did address local issues, it also actively engaged with broader national political concerns.  Its activities extended beyond local self-governance to include issues of national importance, such as the demand for greater Indian representation in the legislative councils, and opposition to specific policies of the British government, showing an early pan-Indian political consciousness.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Indian Association was founded in Bengal, it did not limit its participation to Bengali intellectuals.  The organization attracted members and support from across India, highlighting the growing national sentiment that transcended regional boundaries. The participation of individuals from diverse regions reflected the growing interconnectedness among educated Indians and the rise of a pan-Indian political consciousness.


**5. With reference to the Government’s attitude towards the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial response of the British government to the Congress was one of cautious observation and limited engagement.
2. The government consistently sought to suppress the Congress through repressive measures from its inception.
3. The government's attitude towards the Congress varied over time, shifting from initial tolerance to increasing hostility as the Congress grew more assertive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Initially, the British government viewed the Indian National Congress with a degree of caution and limited engagement. They initially underestimated the Congress's potential for mobilization and influence.  The government's early response was characterized by a wait-and-see approach, observing the Congress's activities and assessing its impact on the political landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the British government did resort to repressive measures against the Congress at various stages, it did not consistently use such measures from the Congress's inception.  The government's early approach was more one of observation and limited engagement.  The use of repressive measures intensified as the Congress's demands grew bolder and its influence increased, particularly as the movement shifted from moderate to more assertive and radical approaches.

Statement 3 is correct. The British government's attitude towards the Congress evolved significantly over time.  Early years saw a degree of tolerance, even a degree of calculated appeasement, but as the Congress's political demands became more assertive and its mass mobilization capabilities increased, the government responded with increasing hostility. This shift in attitude is evident in the government's response to the various phases of the nationalist movement.  The use of repressive measures became more frequent and systematic as the Congress posed a greater challenge to British authority.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Revolt of 1857:**

1. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 directly contributed to the widespread resentment among sepoys, many of whom hailed from that region.
2.  The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle with greased cartridges, which violated the religious sensibilities of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
3. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor, provided strong and decisive leadership throughout the revolt, uniting diverse groups under a single banner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The annexation of Awadh in 1856 was a significant factor leading to the Revolt of 1857.  Many sepoys in the British East India Company's army were from Awadh, and the annexation deeply affected their regional and personal loyalties, leading to widespread discontent within the army. The loss of their homeland and the subsequent economic hardships further fueled their resentment towards the British. This is a crucial point for understanding the context of the revolt, as it wasn't solely a military mutiny but also a manifestation of broader socio-political grievances.

Statement 2 is also correct. The greased cartridges provided the immediate spark that ignited the simmering discontent within the sepoy ranks. The rumor that the cartridges were greased with beef and pork fat, substances considered religiously offensive to Hindus and Muslims respectively, deeply offended the sepoys. This perceived violation of religious beliefs served as the catalyst that brought the existing grievances to the forefront, leading to widespread mutiny and rebellion. While the greased cartridges were the immediate trigger, it's crucial to remember they tapped into a pre-existing reservoir of discontent.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Bahadur Shah Zafar was proclaimed Emperor of India by the rebels and became a symbolic figurehead of the revolt, he did not provide strong and decisive leadership.  He was an elderly and relatively weak ruler, often indecisive and vacillating in his support for the rebellion.  His lack of strong leadership contributed to the fragmented nature of the revolt and hampered its overall effectiveness. The real leadership often rested with other figures like Nana Sahib, Rani Lakshmibai, and Bakht Khan, who commanded more influence and military prowess.  Understanding the limitations of Bahadur Shah's leadership is key to a nuanced understanding of the 1857 events.



**2. With reference to the leaders of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. Rani Lakshmibai, the queen of Jhansi, was a key military leader known for her courage and military skills, leading rebel forces in several battles.
2. Nana Sahib, the adopted son of the last Peshwa, played a significant role in the Kanpur uprising, but his reputation was tarnished by the massacre of British prisoners.
3. Kunwar Singh, a zamindar from Bihar, was a significant military strategist who, despite his advanced age, played a crucial role in organizing and leading the rebellion in Bihar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the roles of these prominent leaders in the Revolt of 1857.  Statement 1 correctly highlights Rani Lakshmibai's significant military contributions. She was not only a symbol of resistance but also a skilled warrior who effectively commanded rebel forces, displaying exceptional bravery and tactical acumen in various battles.  Her participation significantly bolstered the morale of the rebels and inspired countless others.

Statement 2 is accurate in its assessment of Nana Sahib's role in the Kanpur uprising and the controversy surrounding the massacre. While he played a crucial role in the initial success of the revolt in Kanpur, the subsequent massacre of British prisoners at Kanpur severely damaged his image and legacy. This event, though disputed by some historians, remains a significant aspect of the Kanpur uprising and a point of contention in understanding the morality and consequences of the revolt.

Statement 3 correctly identifies Kunwar Singh's importance despite his age.  His advanced age did not diminish his strategic abilities; he was a highly effective military strategist and organizer, playing a vital role in coordinating the rebellion in Bihar. His military skills and experience, even at his advanced age, made him a formidable leader and a key figure in the revolt's regional success.  His story exemplifies the broad spectrum of participants in the revolt.


**3. With reference to the causes of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic policies of the British East India Company led to widespread poverty and resentment among the peasantry due to heavy taxation, land alienation, and the destruction of traditional industries.
2. The religious sensitivities of the Indian population were not significantly impacted by British policies, and religious factors played a minor role in the outbreak of the revolt.
3. The British administrative policies, characterized by corruption, inefficiency, and a sense of racial superiority, further alienated the Indian population and contributed to the overall discontent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British East India Company's economic policies were a major cause of widespread poverty and resentment among the Indian populace.  Heavy taxation, coupled with the destruction of traditional Indian industries like textiles and handicrafts, led to economic hardship for millions.  The introduction of new land revenue systems like the Permanent Settlement also resulted in widespread land alienation, displacing peasants and exacerbating poverty. This economic distress was a key factor contributing to the widespread discontent that culminated in the 1857 revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Religious sensitivities were significantly affected by British policies, and religious factors played a substantial role in the outbreak of the revolt. The perceived threat to religious practices, particularly the introduction of the greased cartridges for the Enfield rifle, was a powerful catalyst that mobilized both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.  Rumors about the cartridges being greased with beef and pork fat, substances considered religiously offensive, directly tapped into deep-seated religious sentiments and ignited widespread resentment, significantly contributing to the revolt's outbreak.

Statement 3 is correct.  British administrative policies contributed substantially to the overall discontent that led to the 1857 revolt. Corruption and inefficiency were rife within the Company's administration, with petty officials often exploiting the populace. The British also displayed a sense of racial superiority, treating Indians with contempt and undermining their dignity. This patronizing attitude and the lack of opportunities for Indians within the administration further fueled resentment and contributed to the overall climate of discontent that preceded the revolt.  This administrative failure is a vital aspect of the historical narrative.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the aftermath of the Revolt of 1857:**

1. The British Crown assumed direct control over India, abolishing the rule of the East India Company, and the governance of India was restructured under the direct authority of the British monarch.
2. The Revolt of 1857 led to significant reforms and improvements in the British administration's treatment of the Indian population, ensuring greater equality and justice.
3. The British army underwent significant reorganization, with a reduced reliance on Indian sepoys and a greater emphasis on European troops, reflecting a shift in military strategy and trust.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Revolt of 1857 had a profound impact on the structure of British rule in India.  Following the revolt, the British Crown assumed direct control over India, effectively ending the rule of the East India Company. The Government of India Act 1858 transferred the administration of India from the Company to the British Crown, marking a significant shift in the colonial power structure. This transition also led to reforms in the Indian administration, though not necessarily towards greater equality and justice as statement 2 suggests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the revolt did prompt some administrative changes, it did not lead to significant improvements in the treatment of the Indian population in terms of equality and justice. The British response to the revolt was often characterized by harsh repression and a deepening of racial prejudice.  The policies that followed often aimed to consolidate British control, not to improve the lives of Indians.  The "Queen's Proclamation" of 1858, while containing some conciliatory language, did not fundamentally alter the power imbalance or lead to a meaningful increase in equality and justice.

Statement 3 is correct. The British army underwent a significant reorganization in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt.  The British were deeply shaken by the widespread mutiny among Indian sepoys, leading to a significant reduction in the number of Indian troops and a corresponding increase in the number of European soldiers.  This reorganization reflected a profound shift in British military strategy and a clear erosion of trust in Indian soldiers' loyalty. The army was reorganized along communal lines, further exacerbating existing divisions. This restructuring was a direct response to the events of 1857 and represented a crucial change in British colonial policy.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Jyotiba Phule's contribution to social reform included pioneering the widow remarriage movement in Maharashtra and establishing girls' schools in Poona.
2.  Vishnu Shastri Pundit is known for establishing a Widow Remarriage Association in the mid-19th century.
3.  Karsondas Mulji's "Satya Prakash," published in Gujarati in 1852, advocated for women's education and property rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jyotiba Phule was a prominent social reformer in Maharashtra who actively championed the cause of widow remarriage and established one of the first girls' schools in Poona (Pune) along with his wife, Savitribai Phule. This directly challenged the prevailing social norms and contributed significantly to women's empowerment.

Statement 2 is also correct. Vishnu Shastri Pundit played a crucial role in the social reform movement by establishing a Widow Remarriage Association in the 1850s.  The establishment of such associations was instrumental in providing support and advocacy for widows who wished to remarry, defying traditional societal constraints.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Karsondas Mulji did indeed advocate for widow remarriage and published "Satya Prakash" in Gujarati in 1852, the text does not mention his advocacy for women's education and property rights as part of this work.  His focus was primarily on the social issue of widow remarriage within the Parsi community.  The inclusion of other unrelated aspects in this statement serves as a distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of historical figures and their contributions.


**2. With reference to 19th-century Indian social reform movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parsis, under the leadership of Dadabhai Naoroji and others, initiated religious reform movements focused on modernizing social customs related to women's education and marriage.
2.  The Akali Movement, emerging after 1920, primarily aimed at reforming the management of gurudwaras and removing corrupt mahants.
3.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reform efforts centered on promoting Western education among Muslims while strictly adhering to traditional Islamic beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Parsis, a Zoroastrian community, were among the first to embrace social reform in 19th-century India.  The Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha, founded by influential Parsis including Dadabhai Naoroji, actively campaigned for the modernization of Parsi social customs, particularly concerning women's education, marriage practices, and their overall social standing.  This highlights the proactive role of religious communities in driving social change.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Akali Movement, which gained momentum after 1920 in the Punjab, was a significant religious and social reform movement within the Sikh community. Its primary focus was on purifying the administration of gurudwaras (Sikh shrines), which had fallen under the control of corrupt mahants (religious leaders).  The movement's success in wresting control of gurudwaras from corrupt individuals demonstrates a powerful assertion of community self-governance and religious reform.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sayyid Ahmad Khan did indeed promote Western education among Muslims, particularly through the Aligarh Movement, he did not strictly adhere to traditional Islamic beliefs.  His reforms included advocating for social changes such as improving women's status, condemning polygamy, and advocating for education among women. This shows a more nuanced approach to reform that incorporated both modern and progressive ideas within an Islamic context, making the statement a misleading distractor.


**3. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following statements:**

1.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the founding of the INC in 1885.
2.  The early INC primarily focused on achieving self-government through constitutional means and peaceful methods.
3.  The "safety valve" theory posits that the INC was created solely to divert popular discontent and prevent violent uprisings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a pivotal role in the formation of the Indian National Congress.  He facilitated communication among prominent Indian leaders and helped organize the first session in 1885.  His involvement highlights the complex interplay between British officials and the nascent Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The early INC, during its moderate phase, primarily pursued constitutional methods and peaceful means to achieve self-government.  They primarily relied on petitions, public meetings, and reasoned arguments to press for reforms within the existing British administrative framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the "safety valve" theory suggests that the INC served as a means to channel popular discontent, it is an oversimplification. The INC represented the growing aspirations of educated Indians to participate in governance and advance their political and economic interests.  The theory fails to fully acknowledge the genuine desire for self-rule among Indian nationalists, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of historical motivations.  The statement serves as a distractor, testing the examinee’s understanding of the multifaceted nature of the INC’s origins and goals.


**4. Consider the following statements about the early nationalist movement in India:**

1.  The Moderates believed that British rule could be reformed from within through constitutional means and gradual progress.
2.  The Extremists, exemplified by leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, advocated for more aggressive political action, including boycotts and passive resistance.
3.  The Surat Split of 1907 saw the permanent fracturing of the INC into two irreconcilable factions, the Moderates and the Extremists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the approach of the Moderate faction within the early nationalist movement. They believed in working within the existing constitutional framework to gradually achieve reforms and believed in the potential for reforming British rule from within.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Extremists, represented by figures like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai, advocated for more assertive and radical methods of political action.  They championed Swadeshi (support for indigenous industries), Boycott (of British goods), and passive resistance to challenge British rule more directly.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Surat Split of 1907 did represent a significant division within the INC between the Moderates and Extremists, it did not result in a permanent fracturing.  Although the split temporarily weakened the organization, both factions continued to exist and, at times, even cooperated on specific issues. The statement is a distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of the historical event and its lasting consequences.  The long-term impact of the split was not as absolute as the statement implies.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the post-World War I treatment of Turkey, played a significant role in galvanizing Hindu-Muslim unity during the movement.
2.  The movement involved a complete boycott of British institutions, including schools, colleges, law courts, and legislative councils.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the immediate suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Khilafat issue, related to the unfavorable treatment of Turkey by the British after World War I, acted as a powerful catalyst for Hindu-Muslim unity during the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The shared concern for the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate brought together diverse religious groups in a common cause against British imperialism.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement encompassed a wide-ranging boycott of British institutions and goods. This included a boycott of government schools and colleges, law courts, legislative councils, and British-made goods, promoting the use of Swadeshi.

Statement 3 is accurate. The Chauri Chaura incident, in which a mob of protestors set fire to a police station, resulting in the deaths of policemen, prompted Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.  He believed that the movement had deviated from its principle of non-violence and that continuing it would risk escalating violence.  This decision highlights Gandhi's commitment to non-violent methods and his willingness to halt a mass movement to uphold his principles.  The incident serves as a pivotal point in the history of the movement, emphasizing the challenges of maintaining non-violence during mass mobilization.

Statement 1 is accurate. The text explicitly mentions the deportations of Lala Lajpat Rai, Ajit Singh in 1907 following Punjab riots and the subsequent deportation of Bengal leaders in 1908.  These events highlight the British government's repressive measures against rising nationalist sentiment.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurobindo Ghose's call for passive resistance, detailed in the text, aimed at disrupting British commerce and administration through non-cooperation. This strategy was a key element of the militant nationalist approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the militant nationalists *failed* to provide effective leadership, create a sound organization, or reach the rural masses. Their movement remained largely confined to urban areas, and their inability to effectively organize and sustain their efforts contributed to their eventual suppression by the British government. This highlights a crucial weakness in their approach despite the initial upsurge of nationalist sentiment.  The failure to effectively mobilize the peasantry represents a significant limitation of the movement during this period.


**2. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1. The assassination of two British officials in Poona in 1897 by the Chapekar brothers marked the beginning of revolutionary terrorism in India.
2. V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of revolutionaries, was established in 1904 and played a significant role in promoting revolutionary terrorism after 1905.
3.  Revolutionary terrorism, while failing to achieve its primary objective of expelling the British, significantly contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism by fostering a sense of pride and defiance among the population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While the Chapekar brothers' assassination in 1897 was a significant act of violence against British officials, it's inaccurate to definitively label it as the *beginning* of revolutionary terrorism.  The text indicates that revolutionary terrorism emerged as a response to government repression and the perceived failure of other methods of political struggle, which began *after* 1905.  The assassination was an early example of violence, but not the genesis of the broader movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat in 1904 and that several newspapers began advocating revolutionary terrorism *after* 1905.  This accurately reflects Savarkar's role in the development of the movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage concludes that while revolutionary terrorism failed to expel the British, it significantly contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism by instilling a sense of pride and defiance. This is a valid assessment of the movement's impact, even in its failure to achieve its primary goal. The heroism of the terrorists, regardless of their methods, resonated with many Indians.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1. The 1905 Congress session, presided over by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, unanimously condemned the Partition of Bengal and Curzon's reactionary regime.
2. The Surat split of 1907 resulted from irreconcilable differences between moderate and militant nationalists regarding the scope and methods of the nationalist movement, leading to the expulsion of militant elements from the Congress.
3. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, introduced to placate moderate nationalists, significantly increased the number of directly elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils, granting Indians substantial political power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification. While the 1905 Congress session did condemn the Partition of Bengal and Curzon's regime,  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was the president, not Dadabhai Naoroji, who delivered a significant speech advocating for self-government.  The statement conflates two important aspects of the 1905 session.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes the Surat split of 1907 as a consequence of deep divisions between moderate and militant nationalists over the direction and methods of the nationalist movement. This split significantly weakened the Congress and allowed the British to pursue a "divide and rule" strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did increase the number of elected members, but these were largely *indirectly* elected, and a significant number of seats were reserved for landlords and British capitalists. The reforms did not grant Indians substantial political power but were rather a limited concession aimed at appeasing the moderates and isolating the extremists.  The reforms fell far short of the nationalists' demands for greater self-governance.


**4.  With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Revolt's strength significantly stemmed from Hindu-Muslim unity amongst soldiers, the populace, and leaders, with Bahadur Shah II, a Muslim, widely recognized as Emperor.
2.  Key centers of the Revolt included Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Bareilly, Jhansi, and Arrah in Bihar, with Delhi serving as the symbolic nerve center under Bahadur Shah II's nominal leadership and Bakht Khan's effective command.
3.  The Revolt encompassed the entire country and all segments of Indian society, demonstrating complete national unity against British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text emphasizes the crucial role of Hindu-Muslim unity in the Revolt of 1857, highlighting the cooperation between both communities among soldiers, the population, and leaders in their opposition to British rule.  The acceptance of Bahadur Shah II as Emperor underscores this unity.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage accurately identifies the major centers of the Revolt, emphasizing Delhi's symbolic importance under Bahadur Shah II and the actual military command exercised by Bakht Khan.  This highlights the complex leadership structure of the rebellion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Revolt, while widespread and popular, did *not* encompass the entire country or all groups and classes of Indian society.  Many rulers of Indian states, large zamindars, and sections of the upper classes remained loyal to the British or were actively hostile to the rebels.  This demonstrates the limitations of the Revolt's reach and the complexities of Indian society during that period. The lack of complete national unity is a crucial aspect of understanding the revolt's ultimate failure.



**5. With reference to the post-World War II nationalist response in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Following the Civil Disobedience Movement, Gandhi perceived rising corruption and indiscipline within the Congress, hindering the launch of further movements.
2. Subhas Chandra Bose, differing with Gandhi's approach, advocated for full independence and an ultimatum to Britain, proposing a mass civil disobedience movement if the demand was rejected.
3. The Tripuri Congress session in 1939 witnessed a smooth and harmonious resolution of the ideological differences between Gandhi and Bose, leading to a unified strategy for the national struggle.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states Gandhi's concerns regarding corruption and indiscipline within the Congress, and his belief that internal reform was necessary before launching another major movement.  This highlights the internal challenges faced by the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details Subhas Chandra Bose's differing views on the struggle for independence, his advocacy for full independence and his proposal for an ultimatum to the British government, followed by a mass civil disobedience movement if the demand was not met.  This reflects his more radical and assertive approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Tripuri session of 1939, far from resolving differences, actually highlighted the deep ideological rift between Gandhi and Bose.  Bose's election as Congress president, despite Gandhi's opposition, led to a major crisis, with the resignation of key members of the Working Committee and Bose's eventual resignation from the presidency.  The session's outcome underscored the irreconcilable differences between the two leaders regarding the strategy of the freedom struggle.  The failure to achieve unity at Tripuri is a significant event in Indian history.


**1. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were greased with animal fat, considered religiously offensive by both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
2.  The revolt was solely a military mutiny confined to the sepoys of the British East India Company's army, with minimal participation from the civilian population.
3. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor, played a significant, albeit largely symbolic, role as the figurehead of the rebellion, unifying diverse groups under a common banner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The greased cartridges were indeed the immediate spark that ignited the sepoy mutiny.  The perceived sacrilege of using cartridges greased with animal fat (beef and pork) deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim soldiers, who saw it as a deliberate attempt to violate their religious beliefs. This widespread resentment among the sepoys became the catalyst for the broader revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the revolt began as a sepoy mutiny, it quickly escalated into a widespread rebellion involving diverse sections of the Indian population, including peasants, artisans, and various princely states. The participation of civilians, driven by their own grievances against British rule, significantly expanded the scope and character of the uprising. It was not merely a confined military action.

Statement 3 is correct. Bahadur Shah Zafar, though elderly and lacking strong military capabilities, became a powerful symbol of resistance against British rule. His proclamation as Emperor of India unified various rebel groups, providing a focal point for the rebellion.  However, it's crucial to note that the actual leadership and organization of the revolt were fragmented and decentralized, with various regional leaders commanding their forces.  Bahadur Shah's role was more symbolic than directly operational.


**2. With reference to the causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The British policy of annexing Indian states through the Doctrine of Lapse and Subsidiary Alliances fueled widespread resentment among Indian rulers and their subjects.
2. The economic policies of the British East India Company, such as the destruction of Indian handicrafts and the imposition of high tariffs on Indian goods, did not significantly contribute to widespread poverty and unrest.
3. Religious concerns, such as the perceived threat to religious practices by Christian missionaries and the introduction of the Religious Disabilities Act of 1856, played a negligible role in the outbreak of the revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British annexation policies, particularly the Doctrine of Lapse (annexing states without a male heir) and the Subsidiary Alliance system (forcing Indian rulers into dependence on the British), significantly undermined the sovereignty of Indian states and fueled widespread resentment. This feeling of political subjugation was a major factor contributing to the widespread unrest that culminated in the revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British economic policies had a devastating impact on the Indian economy. The destruction of traditional Indian handicrafts through unfair competition from British manufactured goods and the imposition of high tariffs on Indian exports led to widespread poverty and economic hardship among artisans, weavers, and peasants. This economic distress was a crucial factor in the widespread discontent that led to the revolt.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Religious concerns were a significant factor in the revolt. The activities of Christian missionaries were viewed with suspicion and resentment by many Indians, who feared the erosion of their traditional religious and cultural practices.  The Religious Disabilities Act of 1856, which modified Hindu inheritance laws, further exacerbated these anxieties.  These religious fears and anxieties contributed to the broader atmosphere of discontent and fueled the rebellion.


**3. With reference to the leaders of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the last Peshwa, led the rebellion in Kanpur, and his military strategist was Tantia Tope.
2. Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, known for her fierce resistance against the British, was solely motivated by personal grievances related to the annexation of her state.
3. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah of Faizabad played a minor role in the revolt, primarily confined to his local area, and lacked significant influence on the broader rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the Peshwa Baji Rao II, played a prominent role in the 1857 Revolt, leading the rebellion in Kanpur. Tantia Tope, a skilled military leader, served as his key strategist and military commander, playing a vital role in the rebellion's military operations in the Kanpur region. Their combined leadership significantly impacted the early stages of the revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the annexation of Jhansi was a significant factor motivating Rani Lakshmibai's participation, her role in the revolt went beyond personal grievances. She became a symbol of resistance against British rule and inspired widespread support among various rebel factions. Her military skills and leadership significantly contributed to the rebellion's momentum, extending far beyond her personal concerns for Jhansi.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah of Faizabad was a significant leader of the 1857 Revolt. He played a crucial role in organizing and leading the rebellion in Awadh (Oudh) region and was known for his military capabilities and organizational skills. His influence extended beyond Faizabad, significantly impacting the rebellion's progress in the region.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The Government of India Act 1858 transferred the administration of India from the British East India Company to the British Crown, marking the end of Company rule.
2. The Queen's Proclamation of 1858 promised religious tolerance and non-interference in the internal affairs of Indian states, but these promises were inconsistently implemented.
3. The reorganization of the British Indian Army after the revolt involved a significant increase in the proportion of Indian soldiers compared to British soldiers, to foster greater trust and loyalty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act 1858 formally ended the rule of the British East India Company and transferred the administration of India directly to the British Crown. This marked a significant shift in the structure of British rule in India, with the Crown assuming direct responsibility for the governance of the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The Queen's Proclamation of 1858, while promising religious tolerance and respect for the rights of Indian rulers, was not consistently adhered to in practice.  While the British attempted to improve relations with Indian princes, the underlying goal remained the maintenance of British supremacy.  The policy of "divide and rule" continued to be employed, and the British frequently interfered in the internal affairs of Indian states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Following the 1857 revolt, the British fundamentally reorganized the Indian Army.  The proportion of Indian sepoys was drastically reduced, and the number of British troops significantly increased.  This was a direct response to the revolt, reflecting the British government's distrust of Indian soldiers and a desire to strengthen their military control over India.  The army was also reorganized to create divisions and prevent future unified uprisings.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Indian Polity and Governance during the early 20th century.  Each question follows the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the Punjab's canal colonies.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment in 1908 was for a term exceeding five years.
3.  The militant nationalists' program, as articulated by Aurobindo Ghose, aimed at making British administration impossible through organized non-cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the context of the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh—riots in the Punjab's canal colonies in 1907. This event highlights the government's repressive response to nationalist agitation. Statement 2 is also true; Bal Gangadhar Tilak received a harsh six-year prison sentence in 1908, demonstrating the British government's determination to suppress nationalist leaders.  Finally, Statement 3 accurately describes the strategy of militant nationalists, who advocated for Swadeshi, boycott, and non-cooperation to cripple the British administration, as expressed by Aurobindo Ghose's vision of rendering the existing administrative system unworkable.  The emphasis on organized non-cooperation signifies a shift toward more assertive forms of resistance.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these crucial historical facts.


**2. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The assassination of British officials was a primary tactic employed by revolutionary terrorists, mirroring methods used by Irish terrorists and Russian Nihilists.
2.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent revolutionary organization, had a significant presence in Bengal, with its Dacca section alone boasting hundreds of branches.
3.  The revolutionary terrorist movement consistently prioritized mass mobilization and a widespread revolution rather than targeted assassinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the characteristics of the revolutionary terrorist movement. Statement 1 correctly points out that the assassination of unpopular British officials was a key tactic employed by Indian revolutionaries, drawing inspiration from similar movements in Ireland and Russia.  This tactic symbolized a rejection of purely constitutional methods and a belief in direct action.  Statement 2 correctly notes the Anushilan Samiti's widespread influence in Bengal, with its extensive network of branches. This demonstrates the organization's capacity to mobilize and coordinate revolutionary activities. However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  The revolutionary terrorist movement largely eschewed mass mobilization in favor of targeted assassinations and acts of violence against specific officials and symbols of British power.  They did not attempt to generate a mass revolution in the same way as other nationalist movements.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms significantly increased the number of elected members in both the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils.
2.  A substantial portion of the elected members were chosen through indirect elections, with provincial councils electing members to the Imperial Council and local bodies electing members to provincial councils.
3.  The reforms introduced universal adult suffrage, granting all adult Indians the right to vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict aspects of the Morley-Minto Reforms.  Statement 1 is correct; the reforms did increase the number of elected members in the legislative councils, albeit with limitations. This represented a small step towards greater Indian participation in governance.  Statement 2 is also correct; the elections were largely indirect, limiting the direct representation of the Indian populace. This system favored certain established groups and did not reflect universal suffrage.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did not introduce universal adult suffrage.  The franchise remained limited, and the electoral system was far from democratic.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, highlighting the limited nature of the reforms and their failure to address the fundamental demand for self-governance.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the agitation against the partition of Bengal on the Indian National Congress:**

1.  The partition agitation led to a temporary unity within the Congress, with all sections uniting in opposition to the partition.
2.  The agitation intensified the existing differences between moderate and militant nationalists within the Congress, leading to a significant split at the Surat session in 1907.
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji's presidential address at a Congress session during this period explicitly declared the goal of the Indian national movement to be "self-government" or Swaraj.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the impact of the anti-partition agitation on the Indian National Congress. Statement 1 correctly points to the temporary unity within the Congress in opposing the partition of Bengal.  This demonstrated the Congress's ability to mobilize broad-based opposition to specific government policies.  Statement 2 is also true; the agitation exacerbated the differences between moderate and militant nationalists, culminating in the major split at the Surat session of the Congress in 1907. This split significantly impacted the organization's effectiveness for years to come.  Finally, Statement 3 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, explicitly articulated the goal of "self-government" or Swaraj, a significant step in defining the movement's ultimate objective.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to capture the full extent of the partition agitation's influence on the internal dynamics and stated goals of the Congress.


**5. With reference to the Khilafat Movement and the Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, though not directly linked to Indian politics, served as a catalyst for Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule.
2.  The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee Report all contributed to widespread discontent and strengthened the anti-British sentiment that fueled both movements.
3.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, initially launched by the Khilafat Committee, involved a complete boycott of British goods and institutions but excluded a boycott of legislative councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical context and impact of the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movements. Statement 1 correctly highlights the role of the Khilafat issue in fostering Hindu-Muslim unity. While the Khilafat concern was initially religious, its impact extended beyond religious lines, unifying various groups against British rule.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the perceived inadequacy of the Hunter Committee Report fueled widespread Indian resentment against British rule, providing a fertile ground for the movements' growth.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Non-Cooperation Movement did indeed involve a boycott of many British institutions, it also included a boycott of legislative councils, reflecting a rejection of constitutional means and a shift towards more direct forms of resistance.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the historical context.  The other options are incomplete.


**6.  With reference to the  revolutionary terrorist movement in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, was involved in the Kakori conspiracy case.
2. Bhagat Singh, along with other revolutionaries, assassinated a British police officer in retaliation for a lathi charge on a demonstration led by Lala Lajpat Rai.
3. The Chittagong armoury raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant event in the revolutionary terrorist movement in Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key events and figures in the Indian revolutionary terrorist movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Hindustan Republican Association's (later Hindustan Socialist Republican Association) involvement in the Kakori conspiracy case, a pivotal moment in the history of the movement. This case highlights the group's use of armed resistance. Statement 2 is also accurate; Bhagat Singh and his comrades assassinated a police officer in response to the lathi charge on Lala Lajpat Rai's demonstration. This act symbolized the revolutionaries' willingness to use violence against British authority. Finally, Statement 3 correctly mentions the Chittagong armoury raid, a daring and significant act of armed rebellion led by Surya Sen in Bengal.  This raid demonstrated the movement's capacity for bold actions and its reach beyond the northern plains.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these crucial historical facts.


**7. With reference to the Simon Commission and the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Simon Commission, appointed in 1927, was entirely composed of British members, leading to widespread protests and boycotts in India.
2.  The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, recommended Dominion Status as the next immediate step for India and proposed a federal structure based on linguistic provinces.
3.  The All-Party Convention in 1928 unanimously adopted the Nehru Report, demonstrating widespread consensus on constitutional reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Simon Commission and the Nehru Report. Statement 1 is correct; the Simon Commission's all-British composition sparked widespread protests and a boycott, reflecting Indian resentment at the exclusion of Indian voices in determining their own future.  Statement 2 is also accurate; the Nehru Report advocated for Dominion Status and a federal structure based on linguistic provinces, outlining a specific vision for India's constitutional future.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the All-Party Convention did *not* unanimously adopt the Nehru Report.  Significant disagreements, particularly from communal leaders, prevented a complete consensus, highlighting the challenges to national unity even within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**8.  With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent Indian federation with complete control over defence and foreign affairs.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting provinces significant control over their administration, albeit with certain limitations imposed by the Governors.
3. The federal part of the Act, envisaging a federation of British India and Princely States, was fully implemented immediately after the Act’s passage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Statement 2 is correct regarding the Government of India Act of 1935.  The Act did introduce provincial autonomy, granting provinces more control over their internal affairs. However, Governors retained significant powers, limiting the extent of this autonomy. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act did *not* establish a fully independent Indian federation.  Defence and foreign affairs remained under British control.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the federal part of the Act, which aimed to integrate British India and the Princely States, was never fully implemented.  The focus remained largely on the provincial aspects of the Act.  Therefore, only Statement 2 accurately reflects a key feature of the 1935 Act.


**9. With reference to the Second Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's Dandi March symbolized the Indian people's defiance of British laws, particularly the salt tax.
2.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from various sections of Indian society, including significant involvement from women.
3.  The movement resulted in the immediate and unconditional grant of Dominion Status to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Second Civil Disobedience Movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the symbolic significance of Gandhi's Dandi March as an act of defiance against British laws, specifically the salt tax. This act ignited the movement and symbolized broader resistance.  Statement 2 is also correct; the movement saw widespread participation, including significant involvement from women who actively participated in protests and boycotts. This broader participation highlights the movement's impact on various sections of society. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the movement did not result in the immediate grant of Dominion Status.  While it put immense pressure on the British government, the movement's outcome was more complex and did not lead to the immediate achievement of that specific political goal.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**10. With reference to the Congress crisis and the differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President in 1938 was met with unanimous support from within the Congress.
2.  Bose advocated for a more militant approach to the freedom struggle, including the possibility of using force, unlike Gandhi's commitment to non-violence.
3.  Bose's resignation as Congress President in 1939 was followed by the formation of the Forward Bloc, a new political party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the Congress crisis and the differences between Gandhi and Bose. Statement 1 is incorrect; Bose's election as Congress President in 1938 was not met with unanimous support.  There was significant opposition from within the Congress, particularly from those aligned with Gandhi. Statement 2 is correct; Bose advocated for a more assertive and potentially violent approach to the freedom struggle, contrasting sharply with Gandhi's steadfast commitment to non-violence.  This ideological difference was a key factor in the Congress crisis.  Statement 3 is also correct; following his resignation, Bose formed the Forward Bloc, a new political party representing his more radical and militant views.  This further deepened the rift within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the historical events.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on various aspects of the 1857 Revolt and related historical contexts, demanding factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.

**1. With reference to the socio-economic conditions preceding the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British land revenue policies led to widespread peasant indebtedness and land alienation, particularly affecting small zamindars and peasant proprietors.
2.  The destruction of traditional Indian handicrafts, coupled with discriminatory tariff policies, impoverished artisans and craftsmen.
3. The annexation of Awadh, while ostensibly aimed at alleviating the people's suffering under the Nawab's rule, resulted in increased taxation and widespread unemployment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the socio-economic conditions that fueled discontent before the 1857 Revolt.  The British revenue system, particularly the Permanent Settlement and Ryotwari systems, led to increasing land revenue demands, pushing many peasants into debt and forcing them to sell their land to moneylenders. This process disproportionately affected small zamindars and peasant proprietors.  Simultaneously, the influx of British manufactured goods, coupled with high tariffs on Indian products, decimated the traditional Indian handicraft industry, leaving countless artisans and craftsmen jobless and impoverished. The annexation of Awadh, presented as a benevolent act by the British, actually worsened the situation. It led to increased taxation, the dismantling of the existing administrative structure, and widespread unemployment among officials, soldiers, and those dependent on the Nawab's patronage.  These economic hardships played a crucial role in creating the climate of resentment that culminated in the 1857 Revolt.


**2. With reference to the immediate causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the Enfield rifle, with its greased cartridges containing animal fat, deeply offended the religious sensibilities of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
2.  Rumours of the British government's intention to forcibly convert Indians to Christianity further exacerbated existing tensions and fueled the revolt.
3. The annexation of Awadh in 1856 created a widespread sense of insecurity and resentment among sepoys, many of whom hailed from that region, triggering the initial mutiny.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While all three statements touch upon factors contributing to the 1857 Revolt, statement 2 is a generalization. While rumors of religious persecution certainly existed and contributed to the overall climate of fear and distrust, the primary trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle and its greased cartridges.  This directly violated the religious beliefs of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys, igniting widespread anger within the army. The annexation of Awadh, a significant event preceding the revolt, further intensified existing grievances.  The loss of their homeland and the resulting economic distress among sepoys from Awadh played a substantial role in triggering the initial mutiny at Meerut. The rumors of conversion were a contributing factor but not a primary cause.


**3. With reference to the leadership and spread of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bahadur Shah Zafar, though a symbolic figurehead, lacked the decisiveness and strength to effectively lead the revolt.
2.  The revolt was primarily confined to the sepoys of the British East India Company's army, with limited participation from the civilian population.
3.  Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, Nana Sahib, and Kunwar Singh were among the prominent leaders who displayed exceptional military prowess and leadership during the revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Bahadur Shah Zafar's weakness as a leader.  While he became the symbolic head of the revolt, his advanced age, indecisiveness, and internal court intrigues hampered its effectiveness. Statement 2 is incorrect. The revolt significantly involved the civilian population, especially in areas like Awadh and Uttar Pradesh, where peasants and zamindars actively participated. Statement 3 accurately highlights the prominent roles of Rani Lakshmibai, Nana Sahib, and Kunwar Singh. These leaders displayed considerable military skill and leadership in their respective regions, galvanizing popular support and offering strong resistance to the British.  Their actions demonstrate that the revolt was not limited to the sepoys alone.


**4. With reference to the reasons for the failure of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The lack of a unified, pan-Indian leadership and coordination among various rebel groups significantly hampered the revolt's success.
2.  The British army's superior weaponry, military tactics, and effective communication network allowed them to suppress the revolt systematically.
3.  The support of many Indian princes and zamindars to the British, along with the lack of participation from significant sections of Indian society, weakened the rebel cause.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately explain the factors contributing to the failure of the 1857 Revolt. The lack of a unified leadership and coordination among the diverse rebel groups hindered the development of a coherent strategy and efficient resource allocation. The British army possessed superior weaponry, including advanced firearms and artillery, and employed superior military tactics, making it significantly stronger than the disparate rebel forces. The British also had a well-established communication network, allowing them to swiftly deploy troops and coordinate their responses effectively. The support of many Indian rulers and zamindars to the British significantly weakened the rebel cause.  Many sections of Indian society, including the educated elite and some sections of the merchant class, remained either neutral or actively opposed to the revolt. This lack of broad-based support further limited the revolt's potential for success.


**5. With reference to the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India Act of 1858 transferred the administration of India from the British East India Company to the British Crown.
2. The Queen's Proclamation of 1858, while promising religious tolerance and equal treatment, did little to address the underlying causes of the revolt.
3. The British army underwent significant reorganization, with a greater emphasis on recruiting soldiers from loyal regions and reducing the proportion of Indian sepoys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt. The Government of India Act of 1858 formally ended the East India Company's rule and transferred the administration of India to the British Crown.  This marked a significant shift in the structure of British rule in India. The Queen's Proclamation of 1858, while promising religious tolerance and equal treatment under the law, failed to address the fundamental grievances that had led to the revolt. The economic exploitation, social injustices, and political subjugation continued largely unabated. The British army underwent significant restructuring.  The proportion of Indian sepoys was drastically reduced, and the recruitment policy shifted towards regions perceived as more loyal, such as Punjab.  This reflected the British government's determination to prevent future uprisings.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of socio-religious reform movements in 19th-century India and related governance aspects.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding socio-religious reform movements in 19th-century India:**

1. The movements primarily drew their support from the burgeoning merchant class, fueled by their newfound economic power.
2.  Rationalism, advocating faith in reason and scientific temper, formed a core ideological pillar of these movements.
3. The reformist movements, such as the Brahmo Samaj, primarily focused on religious dogma, neglecting contemporary social issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the educated middle class played a significant role, the social base of the reform movements wasn't limited to the merchant class.  It encompassed educated intellectuals from various backgrounds, including government service and professions.  The economic influence of the merchant class was not the primary driver of these reform movements.

Statement 2 is correct. Rationalism, a belief in reason and scientific inquiry, was indeed a central tenet of the socio-religious reform movements.  Reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy championed this approach, seeking to reform religious practices and social structures based on rational principles.  This is evident in their critique of superstitious practices and advocacy for social reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The socio-religious reform movements were deeply concerned with both religious and social issues.  While religious reform was a key aspect, they actively addressed social ills such as the plight of women, the caste system, and other societal inequalities.  The movements aimed for a holistic transformation of Indian society, not just religious doctrines.  The Brahmo Samaj, for instance, actively campaigned against sati and child marriage.


**2. With reference to the British colonial government's approach to social reform in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British government consistently and wholeheartedly supported social reform movements throughout the 19th century.
2. The abolition of Sati in 1829 was primarily driven by the British government's own humanitarian concerns, independent of Indian advocacy.
3. The British government's support for social reform waned after the 1857 Revolt, as they sought alliances with conservative elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British government's stance on social reform was inconsistent. While they did support certain reforms, particularly in the early part of the 19th century, their motives were often complex, intertwined with political expediency and the maintenance of their colonial power.  Their actions weren't always driven by pure humanitarian concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the British government did abolish Sati, it wasn't solely due to their own initiative. The abolition was significantly influenced by the persistent advocacy of Indian reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, along with pressure from missionaries.  The government's actions were a response to both internal and external pressures.

Statement 3 is correct. After the 1857 Revolt, the British government adopted a more conservative approach towards social reforms.  They sought to consolidate their power by allying with traditional elites and conservative sections of Indian society, thereby reducing their support for reform movements that might challenge the existing social order.


**3. With reference to the impact of socio-religious reform movements on women's status in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The movements led to the immediate and complete emancipation of women across all social strata in India.
2.  The Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act of 1856, though passed, had a negligible impact initially due to societal resistance.
3.  The participation of women in the nationalist movement significantly contributed to their empowerment and social awakening.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The socio-religious reform movements made significant strides in improving the status of women, but their impact wasn't immediate or universal.  Deep-rooted patriarchal structures and societal resistance persisted. The changes were gradual and uneven across different regions and social classes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act of 1856 faced considerable opposition from conservative sections of society, limiting its immediate impact. While it legalized widow remarriage, social stigma and resistance significantly hindered its widespread acceptance.

Statement 3 is correct. Women's participation in the nationalist movement played a crucial role in their empowerment.  The active role of women in protests, boycotts, and the freedom struggle challenged traditional gender roles and contributed significantly to their social and political awakening, ultimately leading to greater recognition of their rights and capabilities.


**4. With reference to the British colonial government's revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement system, implemented in Bengal, resulted in the rapid modernization of agriculture and widespread prosperity among peasants.
2.  The Ryotwari system, prevalent in Madras Presidency, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, ensured equitable distribution of land and prevented the concentration of land ownership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement system, while aiming to create a stable revenue base, led to several negative consequences.  It did not lead to agricultural modernization or widespread prosperity among peasants. Instead, it resulted in the concentration of land ownership in the hands of zamindars, often leading to exploitation of the ryots (peasants) and absentee landlordism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari system was characterized by direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars.  However, this system also had its drawbacks, including the potential for overassessment of land revenue and consequent impoverishment of the ryots.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Mahalwari system, while attempting to involve village communities in revenue collection, also didn't prevent the concentration of land ownership.  It often led to exploitation and the displacement of small cultivators, similar to the Permanent Settlement.  The system's implementation was often fraught with inaccuracies and corruption.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The revolt was solely a military mutiny, lacking widespread civilian participation or support.
2.  Religious grievances, specifically related to the greased cartridges, were the primary and sole cause of the revolt.
3. The revolt's failure was primarily due to the lack of a unified and well-defined political ideology among the rebels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1857 Revolt was far more than a military mutiny; it involved significant civilian participation, particularly in regions like Awadh and North-Western Provinces.  Peasants, artisans, and others joined the revolt, expressing their accumulated grievances against British rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the greased cartridges acted as a trigger, the revolt stemmed from a multitude of causes, including economic exploitation, political grievances, social and religious concerns, and the overall discontent with British rule.  The greased cartridges were a spark that ignited pre-existing discontent.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the lack of a unified political ideology contributed to the revolt's failure, it wasn't the sole factor. Other crucial factors included the superior military strength of the British, the lack of all-India coordination among rebels, the support given to the British by certain sections of Indian society, and poor organization among the rebels themselves.  The absence of a cohesive strategy and leadership played a significant role.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab.
2.  Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were among the Bengal leaders deported in December 1908.
3.  The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1908 resulted in a 4-year prison sentence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab's canal colonies. This highlights the government's repressive response to nationalist activities and the unrest prevalent in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly mentions the deportation of nine Bengal leaders in December 1908, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt. This demonstrates the British government's attempts to suppress the growing nationalist movement in Bengal, a key center of political activity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text specifies that Tilak received a "savage sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment" in 1908, not 4 years. This discrepancy indicates a factual error, making the statement incorrect.  The incorrect duration serves as a useful distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual details.  The use of the word "savage" also adds a layer of potentially misleading emotional context.



**2. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in India (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1. Aurobindo Ghose advocated for “making the administration impossible” through organized refusal to cooperate with British commerce and officialdom.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, remained unaffected by the news of Tilak's conviction and the Swadeshi movement in Bengal.
3. The militant nationalists successfully created a sound organization and harnessed the energies of the Indian masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The passage directly quotes Aurobindo Ghose's call for passive resistance and non-cooperation with the British administration to render it ineffective. This reflects the strategic approach of militant nationalists in challenging British rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that news of Tilak's activities and conviction, along with the Swadeshi movement, significantly impacted Jawaharlal Nehru and other Indian students in England, inspiring their nationalist sentiments.  This serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately interpret the textual information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly critiques the militant nationalists for their failure to build a sound organization or effectively utilize the energies of the masses. This highlights a crucial weakness of the movement despite its success in arousing nationalist sentiments.  The inclusion of this statement tests the candidate's understanding of the limitations of the movement.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Partition of Bengal (1905) on the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Partition primarily aimed to facilitate the administrative efficiency of Bengal, given its vast population.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, declared the goal of the Indian national movement to be ‘self-government’ or Swaraj.
3. The Moderate nationalists within the Indian National Congress strongly supported the extension of the Swadeshi and Boycott movement beyond Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British government cited administrative reasons for the Partition, the text clearly indicates that the true motive was to weaken Bengal as a center of nationalist activity by dividing its population along linguistic and religious lines.  This highlights the British government's strategy of divide and rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, declared the goal of the movement to be self-government or Swaraj. This marks a significant shift in the nationalist movement's goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text highlights the disagreement between Moderate and militant nationalists over the scope of the Swadeshi and Boycott movement. The Moderates favored limiting the movement primarily to Bengal, while the militants advocated for its nationwide expansion. This demonstrates a key internal division within the nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chapekar brothers' assassination of British officials in Poona marked the beginning of revolutionary terrorism.
2.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent terrorist organization, had over 500 branches solely in its Dacca section.
3.  Revolutionary terrorism successfully achieved its objective of expelling the British from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text identifies the assassination of British officials by the Chapekar brothers in 1897 as a pivotal event that initiated revolutionary terrorism in India.  This demonstrates the emergence of violent methods in the nationalist struggle.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage specifically mentions that the Anushilan Samiti's Dacca section alone boasted 500 branches. This points to the organization's significant reach and influence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that revolutionary terrorism, as a political weapon, ultimately failed to achieve its primary objective of expelling the British.  Despite its contribution to the growth of nationalism, it proved an ineffective strategy for achieving independence.  This statement functions as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the movement's outcomes.



**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee report contributed to widespread Indian discontent.
2.  The Treaty of Sevres, signed in May 1920, resulted in favorable terms for Turkey, satisfying Indian Muslims.
3.  Gandhi's withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement was solely due to the Chauri Chaura incident.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly links the Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the unsatisfactory Hunter Committee report to the rising discontent among Indians, providing a context for the Non-Cooperation movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Treaty of Sevres dismembered Turkey, leading to widespread anger among Indian Muslims and fueling the Khilafat movement.  This serves as an important distractor, testing detailed recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Chauri Chaura incident was a significant factor, the passage indicates that Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement was also influenced by the movement's signs of fatigue, the lack of governmental willingness to negotiate, and the dissipation of the Khilafat issue itself. This highlights the multifaceted reasons behind Gandhi's decision.


**6. With reference to the Swarajist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru advocated for entry into legislative councils to obstruct government plans and expose their weaknesses.
2.  The Swarajists and "no-changers" remained united within the Congress despite differing views on council entry.
3.  The Swarajist movement successfully brought the masses into active politics.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Swarajist strategy of entering legislative councils to oppose the government from within.  This demonstrates a shift in political tactics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly describes a significant split and political controversy between the Swarajists and "no-changers" within the Congress regarding participation in legislative councils.  This serves as a critical distractor, emphasizing the internal divisions within the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Swarajists, despite their successes in council elections, failed to effectively engage the masses in active politics. This highlights the limitations of their chosen strategy.


**7. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1858-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily focused on economic issues, neglecting social and political reforms.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's writings exposed the exploitative nature of British rule and its impact on India's poverty.
3. The Indian National Congress was formed as a direct response to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly shows that early nationalists addressed a wide range of issues, including social and political reforms alongside economic concerns.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the multifaceted nature of the early movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution as India's first economic thinker, demonstrating how his writings exposed British economic exploitation and its role in India's poverty.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the passage mentions the Sepoy Mutiny and the growing discontent leading to the formation of the Congress, it doesn't state that the Congress was formed *directly* in response to the Mutiny.  The formation was a more gradual process driven by several factors.


**8.  With reference to the government's attitude towards the early nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially welcomed the Indian National Congress, hoping it would act as a safety valve for discontent.
2. Lord Curzon openly expressed his ambition to help bring about the Congress's peaceful demise.
3. The British government consistently used a policy of open and direct repression against all nationalist leaders and organizations.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage mentions that A.O. Hume, a British official, hoped the Congress would serve as a safety valve, indicating an initial cautious approach by the British.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage quotes Lord Curzon's statement expressing his desire for the Congress's demise.  This showcases the evolving British strategy towards the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the passage highlights British hostility, it also mentions periods of attempted conciliation and a more nuanced strategy than outright repression of all nationalist elements.  The government employed a complex approach that included both conciliation and suppression.


**9. With reference to the causes of the 1857 revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic exploitation of India and the destruction of its traditional economic fabric were major contributing factors.
2. The British administration's land revenue policies and systems of law and administration were universally popular and well-received.
3. The British army's reverses in wars like the First Afghan War and the Crimean War had no significant impact on Indian perceptions of British invincibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage highlights the unpopularity of British land revenue policies and the administration's corrupt practices as key sources of resentment among the Indian population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage directly links British military defeats in various wars to a growing belief in the vulnerability of British power, contributing to the atmosphere of rebellion.


**10. With reference to the impact of the First World War on the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The war resulted in improved economic conditions in India, bolstering support for British rule.
2. The Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre increased Indian dissatisfaction with British rule.
3. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms fully satisfied the Indian demand for self-government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the post-war economic situation in India was alarming, with rising prices and decreased industrial production, thus increasing anti-British sentiment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage directly connects the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to the surge in Indian discontent and anti-British feeling.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms failed to satisfy the growing demand for self-government, contributing to further unrest.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on socio-cultural reform movements and their leaders in India, drawing upon details from the target content.  Each question includes a correct answer, a detailed explanation (over 100 words), and analysis of why other options are incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Brahmo Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy initially established the Atmiya Sabha to propagate monotheistic ideals before founding the Brahmo Sabha.
2.  Keshab Chandra Sen's more radical views, including support for inter-caste marriages, led to a split within the Brahmo Samaj, resulting in the formation of the Adi Brahmo Samaj.
3.  Debendranath Tagore, father of Rabindranath Tagore, played a crucial role in revitalizing the Brahmo Samaj after Ram Mohan Roy's death, primarily focusing on social reform within the existing Hindu framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Atmiya Sabha (Society of Friends) served as a precursor to the Brahmo Sabha, laying the groundwork for Ram Mohan Roy's later, more formalized religious and social reform movement.  The Atmiya Sabha focused on promoting the monotheistic interpretations of the Vedanta and criticizing social ills like idolatry and caste rigidity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The split in the Brahmo Samaj occurred due to Keshab Chandra Sen's radical views. However, the resulting factions were the Brahmo Samaj of India (led by Sen) and the Adi Brahmo Samaj (led by Debendranath Tagore), not the Adi Brahmo Samaj alone as the statement implies.  The Adi Brahmo Samaj represented the more conservative wing, retaining a stronger adherence to traditional Hindu practices.

Statement 3 is correct. Debendranath Tagore significantly contributed to the Brahmo Samaj's resurgence after Ram Mohan Roy's death.  He emphasized systematic study of India's past with a rational outlook, further developing and popularizing Ram Mohan Roy's ideas. His leadership focused on reforming Hinduism from within, advocating for widow remarriage, women's education, and other social improvements.  The Tattvabodhini Sabha, founded by him, played a critical role in this revitalization.


**2. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prarthana Samaj, founded in Bombay, primarily focused on religious reform, aiming to purify Hinduism and establish monotheism as its central tenet.
2.  Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj challenged Brahmanical supremacy and advocated for social transformation, not merely social reform, emphasizing education for women and lower castes.
3.  The Arya Samaj, while advocating for a classless society and Vedic principles, also initiated the Shuddhi movement, which aimed at reconverting those who had converted to other religions, contributing to the rise of communalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prarthana Samaj did advocate monotheism, its primary focus was on social reform rather than solely religious purification.  Its agenda included women's education, widow remarriage, and challenging the caste system.  It differed from the Brahmo Samaj in its approach, relying on education and persuasion rather than direct confrontation with Hindu orthodoxy.

Statement 2 is correct. Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj was a radical movement that aimed for complete social transformation, going beyond mere reform.  It challenged the very foundations of Brahmanical dominance and actively worked for the upliftment of marginalized communities through education and social service.  His work directly challenged the existing social hierarchy and power structures.

Statement 3 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, promoted a classless and casteless society based on Vedic principles. However, its Shuddhi movement, intended to reconvert those who had converted to other religions, had unintended consequences.  This movement, while aiming to strengthen Hindu society, contributed to the growth of communal tensions and divisions in Indian society.  The aggressive nature of the Shuddhi movement alienated other religious communities.


**3. With reference to the Aligarh Movement and its leader, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan's primary objective was to promote Western scientific education among Indian Muslims while simultaneously advocating for complete separation of religious and political spheres.
2.  The Aligarh Movement, initiated by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, aimed to modernize Muslim society by reforming practices like purdah and polygamy, and promoting women's education.
3.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, despite his initial support for Hindu-Muslim unity, later shifted towards a policy that emphasized the separate interests of Muslims, contributing to the growth of communal politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was instrumental in promoting Western scientific education among Muslims through the Aligarh Muslim University (then Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College), he didn't advocate for a complete separation of religious and political spheres. His approach was more nuanced, seeking to reconcile modern education with Islamic teachings.  His initial aim was to empower Muslims through education to participate effectively in the then-existing political system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Aligarh Movement, under Sir Syed Ahmed Khan's leadership, actively promoted social reforms among Muslims.  This included advocating for improvements in women's education, challenging traditional practices like purdah and polygamy, and promoting a more modern outlook within the Muslim community.  The movement aimed to modernize Muslim society without compromising religious values.

Statement 3 is correct. While Sir Syed Ahmed Khan initially promoted Hindu-Muslim unity, his later actions and pronouncements contributed to a growing emphasis on separate Muslim interests. This shift in his approach, though arguably motivated by concerns about Muslim backwardness, had the unintended consequence of fueling communal politics. His emphasis on education and economic advancement for Muslims, while initially laudable, became a tool for political division in the hands of later leaders.  His reluctance to actively participate in early nationalist movements further contributed to this outcome.


**4.  With reference to the various religious reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, focused primarily on personal salvation and spiritual upliftment, with minimal emphasis on social service and reform.
2.  The Theosophical Society, though led by Westerners, played a significant role in fostering Indian self-confidence by promoting and glorifying Indian religious and philosophical traditions.
3.  The Dev Samaj, founded by Shiv Narayan Agnihotri, was a reformist movement that emphasized the supremacy of the Guru and promoted social ideals such as discouraging intoxicants and non-vegetarian food.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ramakrishna Mission, while deeply rooted in spiritual teachings, played a major role in social service and reform. It established numerous schools, hospitals, and other charitable institutions, actively working for the upliftment of the underprivileged and promoting humanitarian causes. Swami Vivekananda himself strongly emphasized social action as an integral part of spiritual practice.

Statement 2 is correct. The Theosophical Society, despite being founded by Westerners, had a profound impact on the Indian psyche. By championing Indian philosophies and traditions, it helped restore a sense of pride and confidence in Indian culture and heritage, combating the negative effects of colonial domination.  This renewed self-esteem played a crucial role in the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Dev Samaj, founded by Shiv Narayan Agnihotri, focused on religious and social reform. It stressed the importance of the Guru, promoted ethical conduct (including discouraging intoxicants and non-vegetarian food), and advocated for social improvements.  Its teachings emphasized both spiritual and social aspects of a reformed life.  The Dev Samaj's emphasis on social action sets it apart from purely philosophical or mystical movements.


**1. With reference to the early years of the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab.
2.  Nine Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, were deported in December 1908.
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment in 1908 resulted in a six-month sentence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were indeed deported in 1907 following the riots in the Punjab's canal colonies. This event highlighted the growing unrest and the government's increasingly repressive measures against nationalist activities.  The deportations were a significant escalation of the conflict between the nationalists and the British authorities.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The deportation of nine Bengal leaders in December 1908, including prominent figures like Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, demonstrates the British government's continued efforts to suppress the burgeoning nationalist movement in Bengal. This action further fueled the flames of discontent and resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment in 1908 resulted in a significantly harsher sentence than six months. He received a six-year prison term, a severe punishment intended to cripple the nationalist movement's leadership.  This lengthy sentence underscores the British government's determination to stifle dissent and maintain control.  The shorter sentence mentioned is a deliberate distractor, playing on the potential for confusion regarding the specifics of Tilak's punishment.  The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly include statement 3, which is factually inaccurate regarding the length of Tilak's imprisonment.


**2. With reference to the responses to the partition of Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on boycotting British salt and promoting indigenous textiles.
2.  Rabindranath Tagore's song "Amar Sonar Bangla" was composed during this period and later became the national anthem of Bangladesh.
3.  The Muslim League, established in 1906, actively supported the Swadeshi movement and worked alongside the Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Swadeshi movement encompassed a broader range of boycotts, the focus on boycotting British textiles (especially Manchester cloth) and promoting indigenous alternatives was central to its strategy.  The boycott of British salt was also a significant part of the movement, although perhaps not as prominent as the textile boycott in terms of overall impact.  The statement is not entirely precise but captures the essence of the movement's economic strategy.

Statement 2 is accurate.  Rabindranath Tagore did indeed compose "Amar Sonar Bangla" during this period, and it later gained prominence as the national anthem of Bangladesh, reflecting its significance in the context of Bengali nationalism and the anti-partition movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League's formation in 1906 was partly a response to the Swadeshi movement, but it did not actively support it.  In fact, many within the Muslim League opposed the Swadeshi movement, reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of communal politics during this period.  The League's initial stance was often one of collaboration with the British government, rather than alignment with the Congress's nationalist agenda.  The statement misrepresents the League’s position and its relationship with the Congress during the Swadeshi movement.


**3. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurobindo Ghosh advocated for passive resistance as a primary method of challenging British rule.
2.  The Yugantar newspaper openly advocated for revolutionary terrorism as a means to achieve independence.
3.  The Abhinava Bharat, a secret revolutionary society, was founded by V.D. Savarkar in 1905.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurobindo Ghosh, a key figure in the militant nationalist movement, was a strong proponent of passive resistance as a powerful tool to challenge British authority. His philosophy emphasized the power of non-violent non-cooperation in undermining colonial rule.  This approach played a significant role in shaping the strategies of later nationalist movements.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Yugantar newspaper, a prominent publication of the time, openly advocated for revolutionary terrorism as a viable means to achieve Indian independence.  This publication reflected the growing frustration with constitutional methods and the belief that only forceful action could effectively challenge British power. The newspaper's position represents a significant aspect of the radical wing of the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect, though close.  While V.D. Savarkar was indeed associated with the Abhinava Bharat, a secret revolutionary society, its founding year was 1904, not 1905.  This seemingly minor detail is a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of historical facts.  The incorrect year is a deliberate attempt to mislead candidates who may have a general understanding of Savarkar's involvement but lack precise knowledge of the society's founding date.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include statement 3, which is factually inaccurate concerning the founding year.


**4. With reference to the impact of British policies on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British actively promoted social reforms like the abolition of Sati and widow remarriage after the 1857 revolt.
2.  The British government prioritized military expenditure over social services like education and healthcare.
3.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to restrict the freedom of the Indian-language press.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Following the 1857 revolt, the British government's attitude towards social reforms shifted. While they had previously supported some reforms, the post-1857 period saw a more cautious approach, fearing that further social change might destabilize their rule. The statement misrepresents the post-1857 British policy on social reforms.

Statement 2 is correct.  Throughout the colonial period, the British government in India consistently prioritized military expenditure over social services. This skewed allocation of resources reflected the colonial administration’s focus on maintaining control and projecting power, often at the expense of the welfare of the Indian population.  This fact is well-documented and crucial to understanding the limitations of British rule.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was a direct attempt by the British government to curb the freedom of the Indian-language press, which they perceived as a threat to their authority and control.  The Act demonstrates the colonial government's efforts to control information and suppress dissent. This act is a significant example of British attempts to control public discourse.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly include statement 1, which misrepresents the British government's post-1857 policy towards social reforms.



**5. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars complete ownership rights over their land.
2. The Ryotwari system, prevalent in parts of South India, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in some North Indian regions, involved revenue collection from entire villages as a unit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. The Permanent Settlement did grant zamindars significant rights, including the right to collect revenue from tenants, but it did not grant them *complete* ownership.  The zamindars were still ultimately accountable to the British government for the revenue they collected. The statement is a distractor, playing on a common understanding of the system without fully capturing its complexities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari system was characterized by direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediary landlords. This system was a significant departure from traditional land tenure systems and had profound implications for agrarian relations in South India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahalwari system involved revenue collection from villages as a unit, with village headmen acting as intermediaries between the cultivators and the British government.  This system also had its own set of complexities and consequences for agrarian society.

Option (a) is incorrect because it includes Statement 1, which is not entirely accurate. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes Statement 1, which is a partial truth but misleading. Option (d) is incorrect because it only includes Statement 1 and excludes the accurate Statements 2 and 3.  The correct answer highlights the core features of the Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems.




**1. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The immediate trigger for the Sepoy Mutiny was the introduction of the Enfield rifle with greased cartridges, perceived as religiously offensive by both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.
2.  The revolt was entirely spontaneous and unplanned, lacking any pre-existing organizational structure or conspiratorial network.
3. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor, actively and decisively led the military campaigns throughout the revolt, inspiring widespread support across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The greased cartridges, suspected to be coated with animal fat (pig and cow), deeply offended the religious sensibilities of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys, acting as the immediate catalyst for the mutiny.  This incident, while not the sole cause, served as the focal point for pre-existing discontent to erupt into widespread rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the extent and nature of pre-planning remain debated among historians, evidence suggests the existence of some degree of organization and communication among rebellious groups. The circulation of chapatis and rumors, along with the involvement of religious leaders, points towards a degree of coordination beyond pure spontaneity.  The revolt wasn't a completely synchronized, nationwide conspiracy, but it wasn't entirely devoid of pre-planning or informal networks.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bahadur Shah Zafar's role was largely symbolic. While he was proclaimed Emperor of India by the rebels, his advanced age and lack of decisive leadership hampered his ability to effectively direct military operations.  The actual military command often rested with other leaders like Bakht Khan. His involvement was more about representing a unifying symbol of Indian resistance to British rule rather than leading the military strategy effectively.  His leadership was weak and largely ineffective, often hampered by internal court intrigues.


**2. With reference to the leaders of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. Nana Saheb, adopted son of the last Peshwa, successfully established a long-lasting independent kingdom after expelling the British from Kanpur.
2. Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, known for her bravery, ultimately secured victory and retained control of her kingdom after fierce battles with the British forces.
3. Kunwar Singh, a zamindar from Bihar, despite his advanced age, proved to be a highly effective military strategist and leader during the revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nana Saheb did initially succeed in expelling the British from Kanpur, his control was short-lived. He failed to establish a lasting independent kingdom and ultimately fled after the British recapture of Kanpur. His leadership, while initially strong, lacked the strategic vision and resources to sustain long-term resistance against the superior British military power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rani Lakshmibai, though renowned for her courage and military skills, was ultimately defeated and killed during the fighting for Jhansi. She valiantly fought against the British, but her efforts to retain control of Jhansi were unsuccessful. Her story remains a testament to her bravery, but it doesn't reflect a successful military campaign.

Statement 3 is correct. Kunwar Singh, despite his age (around 80), was a highly effective military leader and strategist.  He skillfully organized and led the revolt in Bihar, demonstrating exceptional military acumen and successfully engaging British forces in numerous battles. His leadership significantly contributed to the revolt's intensity and duration in Bihar.  His military strategies were effective and he is considered one of the most capable military leaders of the revolt.


**3. With reference to the causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic grievances of the Indian population, stemming from British policies, played a minor role in the revolt, with sepoy discontent being the primary driver.
2. The annexation of Awadh, the home region of many sepoys, significantly contributed to the sepoys' discontent and fuelled their participation in the revolt.
3.  The introduction of the greased cartridges was the sole cause of the widespread discontent among the sepoys which directly led to the revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Economic grievances played a significant role in the revolt.  British economic policies, including heavy taxation, the destruction of traditional industries, and widespread poverty, created widespread discontent among various sections of Indian society, well beyond the sepoys.  This economic hardship fueled the existing resentment and contributed to the revolt's broad-based support.

Statement 2 is correct. The annexation of Awadh in 1856 deeply affected the sepoys, many of whom hailed from that region. The annexation resulted in increased taxation, loss of livelihoods, and a sense of betrayal among the sepoys, contributing significantly to their discontent and making them more receptive to participating in the revolt.  This was a major factor contributing to the widespread nature of the revolt.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the greased cartridges served as the immediate trigger, they weren't the sole cause.  The revolt was a culmination of long-standing grievances related to economic exploitation, political subjugation, socio-religious concerns, and military grievances. The cartridges merely provided the spark that ignited the already smoldering fire of discontent.  It is important to understand the multi-faceted nature of the causes.


**4. Consider the following statements about the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The British Crown directly assumed control of India, ending the rule of the East India Company, and the administration was largely unaltered.
2. The British significantly increased the number of Indian sepoys in the army to maintain stability and loyalty, and promoted Indians to higher ranks.
3. The "divide and rule" policy was significantly intensified after the revolt, with the British employing tactics to create divisions amongst different communities and classes in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British Crown did assume direct control of India, abolishing the East India Company's rule, the administration underwent significant changes. The structure and policies of the administration were substantially altered to consolidate British control and prevent future uprisings.  The administration was reformed to prevent future revolts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The British drastically reduced the number of Indian sepoys in the army and increased the proportion of European soldiers.  They also implemented policies to prevent future mutinies, including recruiting soldiers from regions perceived as more loyal and creating divisions within the army.  The army was reorganized to be more heavily reliant on British troops.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1857 Revolt highlighted the dangers of a largely Indian army.  The British responded by consciously adopting and intensifying the "divide and rule" policy. They sought to exploit existing communal and caste divisions to weaken potential resistance. This policy became a cornerstone of British rule in the later years of the Raj.  This policy was used to prevent future uprisings.


**5. With reference to the nature and interpretation of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  All historians agree that the 1857 Revolt was a unified, nationwide struggle for complete independence from British rule, with a shared national consciousness.
2. Some historians view the revolt primarily as a "sepoy mutiny," emphasizing the military origins and limited participation of the civilian population.
3. The revolt lacked a clearly defined ideology or political program beyond immediate grievances and resistance to British authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Historians have diverse interpretations of the 1857 Revolt. While it involved widespread participation beyond the sepoys, the existence of a unified, nationwide struggle for complete independence with a shared national consciousness is debated. The revolt's character varied across regions and involved diverse motivations and participants.  The concept of a unified Indian nation was not fully developed at that time.

Statement 2 is correct. Some historians, particularly those from earlier periods, highlight the military origins of the revolt, emphasizing the sepoy mutiny as its starting point. They downplay the extent of civilian participation and the overall national character of the uprising. This view, however, is increasingly challenged by more nuanced interpretations.

Statement 3 is correct. The revolt lacked a cohesive, centrally articulated ideology or political program. The participants held diverse grievances and objectives. While there was widespread opposition to British rule, there wasn't a single, unifying political vision or a clearly defined alternative political structure. The revolt was characterized by a diversity of motivations and goals.  There was no single, unifying political ideology.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on facets of Indian history related to nationalism, governance, and political movements.  Note that the difficulty level is intentionally set high, requiring detailed knowledge of the period.


**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1. The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab, while the deportation of nine Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, occurred in December 1908.
2. Aurobindo Ghose advocated for "passive resistance" alongside Swadeshi and Boycott, aiming to make administration impossible through organised non-cooperation with British commerce and officialdom.
3. The militant nationalists effectively harnessed the energies of the newly aroused masses, establishing a sound organization to guide their movement and extending their reach to the rural peasantry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the chronological sequence of deportations and the locations of the respective incidents.  The deportations represent a key aspect of British suppression of early nationalist dissent. Statement 2 correctly summarizes Aurobindo Ghose's strategy of passive resistance, highlighting his call for non-cooperation as a method to challenge British authority.  This strategy was a significant departure from purely constitutional methods.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. While the militant nationalists did successfully arouse the masses, they lacked the organizational capacity to effectively channel this energy. Their movement remained largely confined to urban areas and failed to penetrate the rural peasantry significantly, a crucial limitation in a largely agrarian society. This organizational weakness contributed to the eventual suppression of the movement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**2. With reference to the impact of the partition of Bengal on the Indian Nationalist Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1905 session of the Indian National Congress, under the presidency of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, strongly condemned the partition and the reactionary policies of Lord Curzon.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji, chosen as a compromise candidate for the Congress presidency in 1905, advocated for "self-government" or Swaraj in his presidential address, signifying a shift towards a more assertive nationalist goal.
3. The Surat split of 1907 decisively resolved the differences between the moderate and militant nationalists, leading to a unified and strengthened national movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Gokhale's presidency and the Congress's condemnation of the partition. The partition served as a catalyst for the rise of more assertive nationalism.  Statement 2 is also accurate. Dadabhai Naoroji's call for Swaraj, though a compromise candidate, marked a significant shift in the Congress's declared aims.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. The Surat split of 1907 did not resolve the differences between the moderate and extremist factions; instead, it exacerbated them, weakening the Congress in the short term. The split highlighted the internal contradictions within the nationalist movement. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India during the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The assassination of two British officials in Poona in 1897 by the Chapekar brothers marked an early instance of revolutionary terrorism.
2. V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat, established in 1904, was a secret society that actively promoted revolutionary violence as a means to achieve independence.
3. The revolutionary terrorists successfully generated a mass revolution, effectively overthrowing British rule through widespread armed uprisings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate depictions of early revolutionary activities. The Chapekar brothers' assassination and Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat represent significant milestones in the development of revolutionary terrorism in India.  Statement 3 is fundamentally incorrect.  Revolutionary terrorism, while impactful in raising nationalist sentiment and challenging British authority, failed to generate a mass revolution.  The movement remained largely localized and lacked the widespread popular support necessary to overthrow the British Raj.  Their methods, while symbolic and impactful, were ultimately insufficient to achieve their primary goal. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**4. With reference to the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Lucknow Pact of 1916 laid the groundwork for Hindu-Muslim unity, creating a foundation for joint political action against British rule.
2. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee Report all contributed to widespread discontent and strengthened the anti-British sentiment that fueled the movement.
3. Mahatma Gandhi's decision to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement following the Chauri Chaura incident was widely supported by other Congress leaders, who agreed that the movement had become excessively violent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical context of the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movement. The Lucknow Pact fostered Hindu-Muslim cooperation, and the events of 1919 (Rowlatt Act, Jallianwala Bagh, Hunter Committee) deeply angered Indians and fueled the desire for collective action. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement after Chauri Chaura was met with significant opposition from many Congress leaders, who felt that the movement's momentum should not be abandoned.  The decision highlighted the internal tensions and differing strategies within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**5.  With reference to the aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement and the emergence of the Swarajists, consider the following statements:**

1. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru advocated for entering the Legislative Councils to obstruct official plans, expose weaknesses, and arouse public enthusiasm, a strategy opposed by the "no-changers."
2. The Swarajist Party, formed in 1922, successfully achieved its goal of bringing the masses into active politics through its participation in the Legislative Councils.
3. The death of Deshbandhu C.R. Das in 1925 and the rise of communalism significantly weakened the Swarajist Party and the overall nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the contrasting approaches of the Swarajists and the "no-changers" regarding participation in Legislative Councils.  The Swarajists' strategy of "council entry" was a significant political tactic. Statement 3 correctly points out the impact of C.R. Das's death and the rise of communal tensions on the unity and effectiveness of the Swarajist Party.  Communalism significantly hampered the nationalist movement. Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the Swarajists made gains in the councils, their participation did not successfully bring the masses into active politics to the extent they had hoped. The movement remained largely confined to the urban elite.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**6. With reference to the growth of socialist and communist ideas in India during the late 1920s and early 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Russian Revolution significantly influenced the rise of socialist and communist groups in India, attracting many young nationalists who were dissatisfied with Gandhian methods.
2. The Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, actively promoted armed revolution as a means to achieve independence and socialist goals.
3. The Meerut Conspiracy Case, involving the arrest and trial of numerous trade union and communist leaders, effectively suppressed the growing communist movement in India and eliminated its influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The Russian Revolution inspired many Indian nationalists, and the Hindustan Republican Association (and its successor) played a key role in advocating for socialist ideals and armed struggle.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Meerut Conspiracy Case was a significant blow to the communist movement, it did not eliminate its influence.  The communist movement continued to exist and evolve, albeit underground and under pressure. The case is important for showing the British government’s attempts to suppress dissent, not that they succeeded completely.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. With reference to the Nehru Report (1928) and its impact on Indian politics, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report recommended Dominion Status as the next immediate step towards India's self-governance.
2.  The report proposed a federal structure for India, based on linguistic provinces and provincial autonomy.
3. The All Parties Convention unanimously accepted the Nehru Report, paving the way for a united approach to constitutional reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly summarize key recommendations of the Nehru Report.  The report's proposals for Dominion Status and a federal structure were significant steps in the movement for self-governance. Statement 3, however, is incorrect.  The All Parties Convention failed to unanimously accept the Nehru Report due to objections from communal leaders, particularly within the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha. The failure to achieve consensus highlighted the growing communal divisions within the nationalist movement and its inability to overcome them. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**8. With reference to the Simon Commission and the response it generated in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Simon Commission, appointed in 1927, consisted entirely of British members, leading to widespread protests and boycotts across India.
2. The boycott of the Simon Commission united various Indian political groups and parties, at least temporarily, in opposition to British rule.
3.  The anti-Simon Commission movement immediately led to a large-scale, nationwide civil disobedience movement under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the composition of the Simon Commission and the unified opposition it generated.  The all-British membership of the Commission was seen as an insult to Indians and fueled widespread protests. Statement 3 is incorrect. The anti-Simon Commission movement, while significant, did not immediately translate into a large-scale civil disobedience movement under Gandhi's leadership.  Gandhi's involvement in a major nationwide movement came later. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**9. With reference to the  Land Revenue systems introduced by the British in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, aimed to create a wealthy zamindar class that would support British rule and ensure stable revenue collection.
2. The Ryotwari Settlement, implemented in parts of South India, recognized the cultivator as the owner of his land, subject only to the payment of land revenue, thus promoting peasant ownership.
3. The Mahalwari System, introduced in the Gangetic valley and other regions, involved revenue settlement with village communities or estates (Mahals), offering a more equitable distribution of land ownership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the core objectives and consequences of the Permanent Settlement. The British aimed to create a loyal class of zamindars for political stability and revenue security.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. The Ryotwari system, while settling revenue directly with cultivators, did not grant them true ownership.  The government retained significant control and the right to enhance revenue.  Similarly, the Mahalwari system, while involving village communities, did not lead to equitable land ownership; revenue demands were still periodically revised, leaving cultivators vulnerable.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.  The other options present misleading interpretations of the Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems.


**10. With reference to the early nationalists' political work and methods (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. Moderate nationalists primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, such as petitions, meetings, and speeches, to achieve their political goals.
2.  Moderate nationalists believed that the British people and Parliament were inherently unjust towards India and therefore advocated for complete independence from the outset.
3. The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1897, for spreading disaffection against the government, significantly boosted his national prominence and marked a turning point in the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the moderate nationalists' reliance on constitutional and peaceful methods of political engagement.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the impact of Tilak's arrest on his national stature and the broader movement.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Moderate nationalists, while critical of British policies, initially believed in the possibility of reforming British rule through constitutional means.  The demand for complete independence came later, with the rise of extremist nationalists. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The other options include inaccurate or misleading information about the moderate nationalists' beliefs and strategies.


**1. With reference to the Maratha Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Balaji Vishwanath's system of assigning chauth and sardeshmukhi collection to Maratha sardars strengthened the Peshwa's power but ultimately weakened the empire's central authority.
2.  Baji Rao I, known for his guerrilla tactics, significantly expanded the Maratha Empire's control over Malwa, Gujarat, and parts of Bundelkhand by 1740.
3.  Nana Saheb, Balaji Baji Rao, consolidated Maratha control over Malwa, Gujarat, and Bundelkhand, and extended Maratha power to Bengal and the South, demanding tribute from Mysore and other principalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Maratha Empire's history.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the double-edged sword of Balaji Vishwanath's revenue assignment system. While it boosted the Peshwa's influence through patronage, empowering ambitious sardars created autonomous power centers that ultimately undermined the centralized control of the Maratha king and contributed to the empire's later fragmentation. Statement 2 accurately portrays Baji Rao I's military prowess and territorial expansion during his reign. His effective use of guerrilla warfare allowed the Marathas to significantly expand their control over significant regions of central and western India. Statement 3 correctly describes Nana Saheb's reign and the further expansion of Maratha influence, highlighting the consolidation of existing territories and the extension of their power into new areas, including Bengal and the South. The options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to capture the complete historical accuracy present in all three statements.


**2. With reference to the early Nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists, while professing loyalty to British rule, aimed to transform it into a system approximating national rule rather than seeking immediate expulsion of the British.
2.  The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1897, initially a largely regional leader in Maharashtra, transformed him into an all-India figure, galvanizing the nationalist movement.
3.  The Moderate nationalists primarily employed constitutional agitation, petitions, and public opinion building to achieve political progress, believing in gradual, orderly reform within the existing legal framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the characteristics of the early nationalist movement in India. Statement 1 highlights the nuanced approach of early nationalists who, while outwardly expressing loyalty to the British Crown, strategically worked towards a gradual transfer of power rather than outright rebellion. This approach was a pragmatic response to the political realities of the time and reflected a belief in the possibility of influencing British policy through constitutional means. Statement 2 correctly identifies the pivotal role of Tilak's arrest in transforming him into a national leader. The government's actions, rather than suppressing the movement, inadvertently amplified Tilak's influence and sparked widespread protests across India, marking a turning point in the nationalist struggle. Statement 3 accurately describes the methods employed by moderate nationalists, emphasizing their reliance on constitutional methods and the building of public opinion.  Their approach was characterized by a belief in reasoned dialogue and persuasion as the most effective means of achieving political change. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect, as they fail to recognize the historical accuracy reflected in all three statements.


**3. With reference to socio-cultural reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, aimed to purify Hinduism by emphasizing monotheism, reason, and the rejection of idolatry and meaningless rituals, while incorporating elements from other religions.
2.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, advocated a return to Vedic principles, emphasizing a classless and casteless society and a united India free from foreign rule. A split occurred in 1893 over issues such as vegetarianism and the curriculum in DAV colleges.
3.  Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj challenged upper-caste domination and Brahminical supremacy, advocating for social transformation through education and social service for women and lower castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements provide accurate accounts of significant socio-cultural reform movements in 19th-century India. Statement 1 correctly describes the Brahmo Samaj's core tenets and objectives, including its emphasis on monotheism, reason, and the rejection of certain traditional Hindu practices. The Samaj's inclusive approach, aiming to purify rather than replace Hinduism, is also accurately highlighted.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Arya Samaj's goals, including its emphasis on Vedic principles and its vision for a united and independent India. The statement also correctly notes the internal divisions within the Arya Samaj that led to a significant split in 1893. The conflicting views on vegetarianism and the educational curriculum in DAV colleges were indeed key factors in this division. Statement 3 accurately portrays Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj's focus on challenging social inequalities and advocating for the upliftment of women and lower castes through education and social service.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they do not acknowledge the historical accuracy of all three statements.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Revolt was solely a product of sepoy discontent stemming from grievances related to the introduction of new rifle cartridges greased with animal fat, violating religious sensibilities.
2.  The economic exploitation of India, land revenue policies, and a corrupt administrative system fueled widespread popular discontent that contributed significantly to the Revolt.
3.  The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856, adversely affecting the livelihoods of many sepoys and creating widespread resentment in Avadh, served as a major catalyst for the Revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the greased cartridges certainly played a role in triggering the initial mutiny of the sepoys (Statement 1), reducing the Revolt to this single cause is a significant oversimplification.  The Revolt was far more complex, encompassing widespread popular discontent rooted in various grievances. Statement 2 correctly highlights the crucial role of economic exploitation, unjust land revenue policies, and administrative corruption in fueling this discontent. The British economic policies had impoverished large segments of the population, leading to widespread resentment.  Statement 3 accurately identifies the annexation of Awadh as a significant catalyst. This act directly impacted the livelihoods of numerous sepoys, many of whom hailed from Awadh, and intensified existing anti-British sentiments.  Therefore, Statement 1 is incorrect as it presents an incomplete and simplistic view of the causes of the 1857 Revolt. Statement 2 and 3 are correct, reflecting the complex interplay of factors that led to the uprising.  Option (b) is the most appropriate answer.


**5. With reference to British policies in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British adopted a policy of 'divide and rule', exploiting existing social and religious divisions to prevent a united challenge to their authority.  This included favoring certain groups (like Zamindars) against others (like the peasantry) to maintain control.
2.  Despite initial efforts to modernize India, the British administration, after 1857, adopted a predominantly reactionary approach, restricting Indian participation in administration and hindering social reforms that challenged established power structures.
3.  British land revenue systems, such as the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems, while aiming for efficient revenue collection, often led to the impoverishment of the peasantry and increased land inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of British policies in India following the 1857 Revolt. Statement 1 correctly identifies the "divide and rule" strategy as a central element of British governance.  This policy actively exploited pre-existing social and religious divisions to prevent the emergence of a unified national movement against British rule. The British often played different social groups against each other to maintain their control. Statement 2 correctly points out the shift towards a more reactionary approach after 1857.  While there were earlier attempts at modernization, the post-1857 era saw a greater emphasis on maintaining control and suppressing any movements that challenged British authority. Social reforms that threatened the existing power structures were often actively discouraged. Statement 3 accurately describes the detrimental impact of the various British land revenue systems on the Indian peasantry.  These systems, while ostensibly designed to streamline revenue collection, often resulted in high tax burdens, widespread indebtedness, and increased land inequality, leading to significant social and economic disruption.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making option (d) the appropriate answer.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of 19th-century Indian social and religious reform movements,  women's rights, and the caste system, drawing parallels to contemporary governance and polity issues.


**1. With reference to 19th-century social reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jotiba Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj primarily focused on promoting education among women and lower castes, advocating for a society free from exploitation.
2.  The Widow Remarriage Association, founded in the 1850s, was solely responsible for the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856.
3.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh, also known as Lokahitawadi, championed the reorganization of Indian society based on rational principles and modern humanistic values, advocating for the complete abolition of the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jotiba Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth-Seekers' Society) was indeed dedicated to social reform, particularly focusing on education for women and lower castes, and challenging caste-based oppression.  His vision extended beyond mere reform to encompass a societal transformation based on equality and justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Widow Remarriage Association played a crucial role in advocating for widow remarriage, the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856 was a culmination of efforts from various individuals and organizations, with Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar being a key figure.  Attributing the Act solely to the Association is an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh (Lokahitawadi) did advocate for societal reorganization based on rational principles and modern values. However, while he strongly criticized the caste system, the text doesn't explicitly state he called for its complete abolition.  His focus was more on reforming existing structures and promoting social equality.


**2. With reference to the women's movement in 19th and early 20th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The All India Women's Conference (AIWC), founded in 1927, was the first women's organization in India to advocate for complete gender equality.
2.  The Age of Consent Act of 1891, primarily driven by the efforts of B.M. Malabari, raised the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18.
3.  The participation of Indian women in the nationalist movement significantly contributed to their awakening and emancipation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the AIWC played a pivotal role in advancing women's rights, it wasn't the first organization dedicated to this cause.  Other organizations like the Bharat Stree Mahamandal and the Ladies Social Conference predate the AIWC.  The AIWC is notable for its more egalitarian and inclusive approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Age of Consent Act of 1891, significantly influenced by B.M. Malabari's activism, raised the age of consent for girls to 12, not 18.  The age was later raised further through subsequent legislation.

Statement 3 is correct.  Women's active involvement in the nationalist movement, including participation in protests, civil disobedience, and political activities, proved instrumental in their empowerment and social transformation.  Their participation challenged societal norms and contributed to a broader shift in attitudes toward gender equality.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, was purely a reformist movement that sought to modernize Hinduism without any revivalist elements.
2.  The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, primarily focused on promoting modern Western education among Muslims while advocating for a reconciliation between Islamic teachings and modern thought.
3.  The Ramakrishna Mission, established by Swami Vivekananda, emphasized both spiritual and social reform, combining Vedanta philosophy with humanitarian service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arya Samaj, while advocating for reform, also had strong revivalist aspects, emphasizing a return to the Vedas as the ultimate source of religious authority.  This revivalist element is a crucial part of understanding the movement's impact.

Statement 2 is correct. The Aligarh Movement, led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, primarily focused on modernizing Muslim society through education and aligning Islamic thought with modern scientific and rational principles.  Its goal was to improve the social and economic standing of Muslims through education and not necessarily religious reform in a traditional sense.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, is known for its holistic approach to reform, encompassing both spiritual and social dimensions.  It effectively combined Vedanta philosophy with practical humanitarian work, significantly impacting social reform efforts.


**4. With reference to the impact of social reform movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 19th-century social reform movements completely eradicated caste-based discrimination and untouchability in India.
2.  The movements led to the immediate and complete emancipation of women, ensuring full gender equality across all aspects of life.
3.  These movements contributed to a shift towards a more rational, secular, and national outlook, challenging traditional religious and social hierarchies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the reform movements significantly challenged caste-based discrimination and untouchability, they did not completely eradicate these deeply entrenched social ills. The struggle against caste continues even today.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The emancipation of women was a gradual process, and while the movements made significant strides, full gender equality remains an ongoing aspiration.  Many traditional patriarchal structures persisted despite the reforms.

Statement 3 is correct. The social reform movements played a vital role in fostering a more rational, secular, and nationalistic consciousness in India. They challenged traditional hierarchies and promoted a more inclusive and equitable society, laying the groundwork for future progress.  This shift in perspective was crucial in the development of modern India.


**5.  With reference to prominent figures in 19th-century social reform, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pandita Ramabai Saraswati primarily focused on the education of women from the lower castes.
2.  D.K. Karve's contributions were largely confined to promoting widow remarriage in Maharashtra.
3.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan's efforts were primarily directed at promoting Western education among Muslims while simultaneously working to improve the condition of women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Pandita Ramabai Saraswati was a significant figure in women's education and social reform, her work wasn't exclusively focused on lower-caste women. Her contributions extended to a wider range of women in need.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  D.K. Karve's work extended beyond widow remarriage in Maharashtra. He made significant contributions to women's education and social upliftment in broader contexts as well.

Statement 3 is correct. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan's efforts were focused on the educational and social upliftment of Muslims, particularly through the promotion of Western education.  Simultaneously, he also advocated for the improvement of women's status within the Muslim community.  His work exemplifies the intersection of education, social reform, and community development.

**1. With reference to the British Raj's administrative policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently pursued a policy of modernization in India from the outset of their rule, aiming for progressive societal changes.
2. The "divide and rule" strategy actively exploited existing social divisions in India, including religious, regional, and caste-based differences, to maintain control.
3.  The British consistently supported social reform movements throughout the 19th century, viewing such reforms as crucial for India's development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British initially expressed intentions of modernization, their policies often became reactionary, hindering genuine progress and prioritizing their own interests. They frequently used the pretext of Indians being unfit for self-governance to justify their actions.

Statement 2 is correct. The "divide and rule" policy was a cornerstone of British strategy in India.  They strategically played different groups against each other, exacerbating existing tensions to prevent a unified challenge to their rule. This is evidenced by their manipulation of religious and caste differences to maintain political dominance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the British initially supported some social reforms (like the abolition of Sati), their support waned as they realized that certain reforms could potentially undermine their power.  Later, they often sided with conservative elements to maintain stability and avoid challenges to their authority.


**2. With reference to the British Raj's revenue policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, aimed to establish a fair and equitable system of land revenue collection that protected the interests of both zamindars and ryots.
2. The Ryotwari system, implemented in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly taxed individual cultivators, leading to increased government revenue but also widespread peasant impoverishment.
3.  The Mahalwari system, primarily implemented in northern India, avoided the problems faced by the Permanent and Ryotwari systems by ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of land revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement aimed to establish a fixed land revenue system, it led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of zamindars and often resulted in the exploitation of ryots (peasants) due to high tax demands and lack of protection for tenant rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari system, while increasing government revenue, often resulted in overassessment of land revenue, leading to widespread peasant indebtedness and impoverishment.  The system’s inflexibility and lack of consideration for variations in agricultural yields exacerbated the problem.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Mahalwari system, while attempting to involve village communities in revenue collection, still suffered from problems of overassessment and exploitation.  It did not solve the fundamental issues of high tax demands and lack of peasant protection.  The system also faced difficulties in accurately assessing land and revenue.


**3.  With reference to the Indian Nationalist Movement (1858-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalist movement was solely focused on achieving complete independence from British rule.
2.  Moderate nationalists primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation, petitions, and appeals to British public opinion to achieve political reforms.
3.  The Ilbert Bill controversy highlighted the racial discrimination prevalent in the judicial system during British rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early nationalist movement, while gradually evolving towards the goal of independence, initially focused on securing greater Indian participation in administration and achieving political reforms within the existing framework of British rule.  Complete independence was not the immediate, singular objective.

Statement 2 is correct. Moderate nationalists, such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, believed in working within the existing constitutional framework to achieve reforms. Their methods involved petitions, public appeals, and reasoned arguments presented to the British government and public.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ilbert Bill controversy, concerning the jurisdiction of Indian judges over European citizens, exposed the deep-seated racial prejudices and discriminatory practices within the British judicial system in India, fueling nationalist sentiment.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue was directly related to Indian political aspirations and played a minor role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.
3. The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, aimed to create a unified Indian constitution acceptable to both Hindus and Muslims but failed to achieve this goal due to communal divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While not directly linked to Indian politics initially, the Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate, became a powerful rallying point for Indian Muslims, significantly contributing to Hindu-Muslim unity and the success of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, in which protestors set fire to a police station, resulting in casualties, prompted Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to concerns about escalating violence and the potential for the movement to be suppressed by the British authorities.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Nehru Report, an attempt at a common constitution, failed due to disagreements between Hindu and Muslim communal leaders, highlighting the growing communal divisions that hindered national unity.  The Muslim League's fourteen points, demanding separate electorates and other concessions, further exacerbated the situation.

1.  Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood as a protest against the brutality displayed by the British administration.
2.  The massacre led to widespread condemnation in India, but received little international attention.
3.  The Hunter Committee's report on the incident was widely accepted as a fair and impartial investigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rabindranath Tagore's renunciation of his knighthood was a powerful symbolic gesture of protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the broader context of British brutality in India.  His act resonated deeply within India and internationally, highlighting the moral outrage felt by many.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre generated significant international condemnation.  News of the event spread widely, causing outrage and criticism in several countries, putting pressure on the British government.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Hunter Committee's report, while investigating the massacre, was widely perceived as a whitewash, failing to adequately address the culpability of the British officials involved and minimizing the severity of the event. The report did not satisfy Indian demands for justice and accountability, further fueling anti-British sentiment.  This highlights the crucial role of independent inquiries and the importance of unbiased investigations in addressing human rights violations.


**2. With reference to the Khilafat Movement and its relationship with the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lucknow Pact of 1916 laid the groundwork for Hindu-Muslim unity, facilitating collaboration between the two communities in the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements.
2.  The Khilafat Movement primarily focused on protecting the religious interests of Indian Muslims, with limited involvement in broader political issues.
3.  Mahatma Gandhi's participation in the Khilafat Movement was primarily driven by his belief that it presented a unique opportunity to unite Hindus and Muslims in a common cause against British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lucknow Pact was instrumental in fostering Hindu-Muslim cooperation, creating a platform for joint political action that proved crucial for the success of both the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements. This collaboration demonstrated the potential for inter-communal unity in the face of British imperialism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Khilafat Movement's origins were rooted in Muslim religious concerns regarding the Ottoman Caliphate, its scope quickly expanded to encompass broader anti-imperialist sentiments and goals, aligning it closely with the Non-Cooperation Movement's wider objectives.

Statement 3 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi recognized the potential of the Khilafat Movement as a powerful catalyst for Hindu-Muslim unity and a vehicle for mobilizing a broader national movement against British rule.  His strategic involvement highlights his astute understanding of the political landscape and his ability to forge alliances across religious divides.


**3. With reference to the Simon Commission and its impact on the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Simon Commission's arrival in India was met with widespread protests and hartals, demonstrating the growing unity and strength of the Indian nationalist movement.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi initially opposed the Simon Commission, believing that it was a futile exercise and that the time for a major struggle against British rule had not yet arrived.
3.  The anti-Simon Commission movement directly led to the launch of a large-scale civil disobedience movement, immediately escalating the struggle for independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Simon Commission's arrival was met with widespread protests and hartals ("work stoppages") across India, showcasing the growing nationalist sentiment and the unified opposition to British rule.  The "Simon Go Back" slogan became a rallying cry, demonstrating the collective resistance to the Commission's perceived lack of Indian representation.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the anti-Simon Commission movement fueled nationalist fervor, Mahatma Gandhi initially adopted a cautious approach, not immediately advocating for a large-scale civil disobedience movement. His reservations highlight the complexities of strategic decision-making within the nationalist movement and the need to carefully assess the timing and preparedness for major confrontations with the British authorities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The anti-Simon Commission movement, while significant, did not immediately trigger a major civil disobedience campaign.  The escalation of the struggle for independence involved a gradual process, with Gandhi's subsequent decisions and actions playing a pivotal role in determining the timing and scope of subsequent movements.  The movement laid the groundwork for future actions, but it did not directly translate into a full-fledged civil disobedience movement immediately.


**4. With reference to the Poorna Swaraj resolution and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lahore session of the Indian National Congress in 1929 formally adopted the resolution demanding complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) as the Congress's goal.
2.  The adoption of the Poorna Swaraj resolution marked a significant shift from earlier demands for dominion status or self-government within the British Empire.
3.  The declaration of 26 January as Independence Day was directly linked to the passing of the Poorna Swaraj resolution, with the date chosen to commemorate the formal announcement of complete independence.

The Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, a landmark event in Indian history, formally adopted the Poorna Swaraj resolution, marking a decisive shift towards complete independence as the primary goal of the nationalist movement.  This declaration represented a significant turning point in the struggle for self-rule.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Poorna Swaraj resolution signified a departure from earlier, more moderate demands for dominion status or self-government within the British Commonwealth. The demand for complete independence indicated a growing assertiveness and a rejection of any form of continued British control over India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the declaration of 26 January as Independence Day was closely associated with the growing momentum towards independence, the date was not directly chosen to commemorate the *formal* announcement of complete independence through the Poorna Swaraj resolution. The date had significance in the context of the growing movement but was not directly tied to the resolution's announcement.  The date's selection had broader historical context, including the earlier declaration of Purna Swaraj.



**5. With reference to the Second Civil Disobedience Movement and the Dandi March, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dandi March, led by Mahatma Gandhi, involved a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt laws, representing a broader challenge to British authority in India.

The march's symbolic significance resonated across India, inspiring widespread participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi's declaration, "sedition has become my religion," powerfully articulated his commitment to challenging British rule through non-violent means, emphasizing the moral dimension of the struggle for independence.  His willingness to embrace the label of "sedition" highlighted the inherent conflict between his commitment to non-violent resistance and the British government's repressive policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Second Civil Disobedience Movement, while impactful, did not immediately lead to complete independence for India.  The movement contributed significantly to the momentum towards independence, but the achievement of freedom involved a protracted struggle, with subsequent movements and events playing crucial roles.  The movement was a crucial step, but not the final one.

The movement's impact extended beyond purely political objectives, addressing crucial socio-economic inequalities.

Statement 2 is correct. Students were among the most active participants in the movement, demonstrating their commitment to the cause of independence.  Many left government-run educational institutions to join national schools and colleges, signifying their willingness to sacrifice their education for the nationalist cause.  This highlights the importance of youth in driving social and political change.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Women's participation in the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement was substantial, challenging societal norms and demonstrating their commitment to the struggle for independence. They actively participated in boycotts, picketing, and fund-raising activities, despite facing social constraints.  Their involvement highlights the crucial role of women in the nationalist movement and their willingness to overcome social barriers to participate in political action.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident involved a violent confrontation between protestors and police, resulting in the deaths of several policemen.  The incident underscored the inherent risks of maintaining non-violent discipline within a mass movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement following the Chauri Chaura incident was met with mixed reactions within the Congress. While some leaders supported his decision, others strongly opposed it, believing that the movement should continue despite the incident.  This highlights the internal debates and differing perspectives within the Congress regarding strategy and tactics.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Chauri Chaura incident highlighted the difficulties of maintaining non-violent discipline within a large-scale mass movement, underscoring the challenges involved in controlling the actions of a diverse and emotionally charged populace.  The incident demonstrated the delicate balance between mobilizing mass participation and maintaining non-violent principles.


**8. With reference to the Swarajist Party and its approach to the legislative councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajist Party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for participation in legislative councils as a means of obstructing government policies and mobilizing public opinion.
2.  The Swarajist Party's approach was met with unanimous support from within the Congress, with all factions agreeing on the strategy of entering legislative councils.
3. The Swarajist Party's participation in the councils was highly successful in achieving immediate political reforms and effectively dismantling British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru's Swarajist Party advocated for entering legislative councils not to cooperate with the British government but to obstruct its policies from within, using the platform to expose the government's weaknesses and raise public awareness.  This strategy reflected a tactical shift within the nationalist movement, seeking to utilize existing political structures for political gain.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Swarajist Party's approach to entering legislative councils was not met with unanimous support within the Congress.  A significant faction, known as the "No-Changers," opposed the strategy, believing that participation in the councils would compromise the nationalist movement's principles and dilute its focus on mass mobilization. This division highlights the diverse strategies and approaches within the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swarajist Party's participation in legislative councils, while achieving some limited successes in obstructing government policies, did not lead to immediate political reforms or the dismantling of British rule.  Their activities were a part of a larger struggle, and the ultimate achievement of independence required further efforts and movements.  The limited success highlights the constraints of working within the existing colonial system.



**9. With reference to the growth of socialist and communist ideas in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Russian Revolution significantly influenced the emergence of socialist and communist groups in India, inspiring many young nationalists to explore alternative ideologies.
2.  M.N. Roy's election to the leadership of the Communist International marked a significant milestone for Indian participation in international communist movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Russian Revolution had a profound impact on the emergence of socialist and communist groups in India. The success of the Bolsheviks inspired many young Indian nationalists to explore socialist and communist ideologies as potential alternatives to the existing political approaches. The revolution showed that revolutionary change was possible.

Statement 2 is correct.  M.N. Roy's election to the leadership of the Communist International was a landmark achievement for India's involvement in international communist movements.  His role highlights the global connections of the Indian nationalist movement and the influence of international political developments on India's own political evolution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The growth of socialist and communist ideas in India during the 1920s was not met with universal support. While these ideologies gained traction among certain segments of society, particularly among students and workers, they did not receive widespread acceptance.  The diverse political landscape of India included various ideologies and approaches, and the acceptance of Marxist ideas was far from universal.  The statement oversimplifies the complex nature of Indian political thought during the period.


**10. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The use of greased cartridges, containing beef and pork fat, was a key immediate trigger for the sepoy mutiny, igniting widespread discontent among both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.
2.  The revolt was entirely spontaneous and unplanned, lacking any form of organization or pre-existing conspiracy among the sepoys and civilian population.
3. The revolt was largely confined to the sepoys, with limited participation from the civilian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The use of greased cartridges, containing materials offensive to both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities, served as a crucial immediate trigger for the sepoy mutiny. This incident acted as a catalyst, igniting pre-existing discontent and setting the stage for a wider rebellion.  The incident tapped into existing grievances and provided a focal point for rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the extent of pre-planning remains a subject of historical debate, there is evidence suggesting some degree of organization and coordination among the sepoys and civilian population before the outbreak of the revolt.  The circulation of chappatis and rumors played a role in coordinating actions.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of a complex historical event.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Revolt of 1857 involved widespread participation from both sepoys and the civilian population, particularly in northern and central India. Peasants, artisans, and zamindars actively participated in the rebellion, demonstrating the revolt's broader social and political dimensions.  The participation of the civilian population gave the revolt a wider base and significance than a mere sepoy mutiny.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British administration, contrary to its pre-1857 intentions, adopted blatantly reactionary policies after the 1857 revolt, primarily due to a belief in the unsuitability of Indians for self-governance.
2. The "divide and rule" policy actively fostered divisions among Indians based on religion, region, caste, and princely states versus their populations.
3.  The British consistently supported social reform movements that challenged traditional social structures, viewing them as crucial for modernizing India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that after 1857, the British administration shifted to reactionary policies, citing the belief that Indians were unfit for self-rule. This marked a significant departure from their earlier, albeit limited, attempts at modernization.  This shift is a crucial aspect of understanding the colonial mindset and its impact on India's political and social development.

Statement 2 is also correct. The "divide and rule" policy is central to the passage, highlighting its deliberate and cynical manipulation of existing social and political fault lines to maintain British control. The passage details how the British pitted various groups against each other to prevent a unified challenge to their authority. This policy is a key element of the British colonial strategy and has lasting implications for understanding India's communal history.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the British *withdrew* support from social reforms after 1858, aligning themselves with reactionary elements of Indian society to counter the rising tide of nationalism. This reversal of policy is a crucial point in understanding the complex interplay between British colonial interests and social change in India.  The British feared that social reforms might further destabilize their rule.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars complete ownership rights over their lands, leading to significant improvements in agricultural practices and peasant welfare.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly collected revenue from individual cultivators, resulting in a more equitable distribution of land revenue and reduced exploitation.
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, assessed land revenue collectively from village communities, fostering a sense of community ownership and preventing land alienation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain significant inaccuracies or oversimplifications.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement did grant zamindars proprietary rights, it did *not* lead to improvements in agricultural practices or peasant welfare.  Instead, it led to widespread exploitation of tenants, absentee landlordism, and the impoverishment of the peasantry.  The high revenue demands often led to zamindars losing their lands through auctions.  This is a classic example of how British policies, intended to simplify revenue collection, had unintended and detrimental consequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari System, while collecting revenue directly from cultivators, did *not* result in equitable distribution or reduced exploitation. Overassessment of land revenue was a major problem, leading to widespread indebtedness and suffering among the peasantry.  The system lacked flexibility in dealing with crop failures and variations in market prices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari System, while assessing revenue collectively, did *not* prevent land alienation or foster community ownership.  In practice, it often led to the displacement of cultivators by moneylenders and merchants, who took advantage of the system's complexities and the high revenue demands. The system, like the others, failed to protect the interests of the peasantry.  The passage clearly indicates shortcomings in all three revenue systems.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British consistently maintained a policy of non-interference in the social and religious affairs of India throughout the 19th century.
2. The activities of Christian missionaries, often supported by sections of the British administration, fueled anxieties among Indians about the threat to their religious and cultural traditions.
3. The British government actively promoted social reforms such as the abolition of sati and the legalisation of widow remarriage to modernize Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the British initially adopted a policy of non-interference, this changed significantly after 1813, as the passage details. The emergence of new interests and ideas in Britain, including the impact of industrialization and the ideals of the Enlightenment, led to increased British involvement in Indian social and religious life. This involvement, however, was often selective and driven by colonial interests.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage emphasizes the role of Christian missionaries and the anxieties they generated among the Indian population.  The missionaries' proselytizing activities, coupled with the perceived support from some British officials, contributed significantly to the growing resentment towards British rule. This religious aspect played a crucial role in shaping popular perceptions and influencing the events of 1857.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the British did abolish sati and legalize widow remarriage, the passage highlights that these actions were not part of a consistent policy of promoting social reforms.  In fact, after 1857, the British government tended to side with conservative elements in Indian society, often hindering further social reforms. The British approach to social reform was inconsistent and often motivated by political expediency rather than a genuine commitment to social progress.



**4. With reference to the British foreign policy in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. British foreign policy in India was primarily guided by the interests of promoting regional stability and peaceful relations with neighboring countries.
2. The expansion of British commercial and economic interests was a major driver of British foreign policy, often leading to territorial expansion and conflicts.
3.  British foreign policy aimed to prevent other European powers from gaining influence in Asia and Africa, leading to conflicts with Russia and France.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that British foreign policy was driven by the interests of British imperialism, not regional stability.  While the British sought to secure their control over India, their actions often destabilized the region and led to conflicts with neighboring countries.  The pursuit of British interests frequently came at the expense of peace and stability in the surrounding areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the expansion of British commercial and economic interests as a major aim of British foreign policy. This ambition led to territorial conquests and conflicts with other powers vying for control of resources and trade routes. The economic motivations were paramount in shaping British actions in the region.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage directly points out that the British sought to limit the influence of other European powers in Asia and Africa. This strategic goal resulted in conflicts with rivals such as Russia and France, who had their own imperial ambitions.  The competition for colonial dominance was a significant feature of 19th-century international relations, directly affecting British policy in India.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the British response to the rise of Indian nationalism:**

1. The British consistently sought to suppress all forms of nationalist expression, including the press, education, and political organizations, throughout the 19th century.
2.  The British government utilized the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 to curb the influence of the Indian-language press, which was seen as a threat to their authority.
3. The British government consistently supported the zamindars and princes as counterweights against nationalist-minded intelligentsia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British did attempt to suppress nationalist movements, their approach was not consistently uniform throughout the 19th century.  There were periods of relative leniency interspersed with periods of intense repression.  The British response was often pragmatic and adapted to the specific challenges posed by the evolving nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 is mentioned in the passage as a specific example of British attempts to control the Indian-language press, which was becoming increasingly influential in shaping public opinion and promoting nationalist ideas.  The act highlights the British apprehension of the power of the press in the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly details how the British government cultivated alliances with the zamindars and princes, using them as a counterbalance to the growing influence of nationalist leaders and intellectuals. This strategy reflects the British attempt to divide and rule, creating internal divisions within Indian society to weaken the nationalist movement.  The British saw the traditional elites as a bulwark against the rising tide of nationalism.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of 19th-century social reform in Maharashtra.  Jotiba Phule's pioneering work in establishing girls' schools is well-documented.  The contributions of Vishnu Shastri Pundit and Karsondas Mulji to the widow remarriage movement are also historically established.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh's advocacy for rational principles and modern humanistic values as "Lokahitawadi" is a key part of his legacy.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial elements of the social reform movement in Maharashtra during that period.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the key figures and movements in 19th-century Indian social reform.



**2. With reference to the contributions of prominent 19th-century social reformers, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, a leading social reformer from Bombay, co-founded an association to reform Zoroastrian religion and the Parsi Law Association, advocating for women's legal rights and uniform inheritance laws.
2. Jotiba Phule's campaign focused solely on improving the conditions of widows in Maharashtra, ignoring the plight of other marginalized communities.
3. Gopal Hari Deshmukh's social reform agenda primarily focused on advocating for the adoption of Western religious practices in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Dadabhai Naoroji's involvement in Zoroastrian reform and his advocacy for Parsi women's rights are well-documented.  Statement 2 is incorrect as Jotiba Phule's activism extended beyond widows to encompass the broader struggle against caste oppression and Brahmanical supremacy. Statement 3 is also false; Deshmukh's reform efforts centered on rational principles and modern humanistic values, not the specific adoption of Western religious practices. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of specific social reformers and their agendas, highlighting potential misconceptions about their work.  It assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information.


**3. With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. The British India Association, formed in 1851 through the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily focused on promoting the interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.
2. The Bombay Association and the Madras Native Association, established in 1852, were primarily concerned with advocating for increased military expenditure and the expansion of the East India Company's commercial activities.
3. The East India Association, founded by Dadabhai Naoroji in London in 1866, aimed to influence British public opinion and promote Indian welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The British India Association did indeed emerge from the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, but its concerns extended beyond landlord interests to encompass broader public issues. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bombay and Madras Associations focused on administrative reforms and Indian participation in governance, not increased military spending or expansion of Company trade. Statement 3 is accurate.  Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association aimed to influence British public opinion on Indian issues.  The question assesses knowledge of early nationalist organizations, their objectives, and the chronology of their formation.  It tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances of historical events.  The distractors in options (a) and (d) play on potentially confusing details.


**4. With reference to the causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic exploitation of India by the British, leading to the impoverishment of peasants, artisans, and handicraftsmen, was a significant factor contributing to the widespread discontent.
2. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 primarily aimed to alleviate the oppression of the people by the Nawab and taluqdars, and it immediately improved the livelihoods of the common man.
3. The British army's setbacks in the First Afghan War, the Punjab Wars, and the Crimean War significantly undermined the belief in the invincibility of British arms and fuelled the confidence of the Indian populace in their ability to successfully overthrow British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately identifies the economic exploitation as a major cause of the 1857 Revolt. The British policies led to widespread poverty and resentment among various sections of Indian society.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dalhousie claimed the annexation aimed to improve the people's lives, it actually worsened their economic conditions by increasing taxes and causing widespread unemployment. Statement 3 correctly points out that British military defeats eroded the perception of their invincibility, emboldening the Indian population. This question tests the examinee's understanding of the multifaceted causes of the 1857 Revolt, requiring both factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between genuine causes and misleading claims. Option (a) is the only option that accurately reflects the major contributing factors.



**5. With reference to the impact of Western education in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The introduction of Western education was primarily driven by philanthropic motives of the British government, aiming to uplift Indian society through the dissemination of knowledge.
2. The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges effectively bridged the gap between the educated elite and the masses, fostering national unity and social cohesion.
3. The neglect of scientific and technical education in the early phase of Western education limited India's capacity for industrial development and technological progress.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the British government’s motives were primarily pragmatic, seeking a cheap supply of educated Indians for administrative and business roles rather than pure philanthropy. Statement 2 is false; the emphasis on English created a wide gap between the English-educated elite and the masses, hindering national unity.  Statement 3 is correct; the neglect of science and technology hampered industrial development. The question assesses understanding of the complex and multifaceted impact of Western education on 19th-century India, requiring critical evaluation of the given statements and their underlying assumptions.  The distractors in options (a) and (c) highlight potential misconceptions about the British government's intentions and the actual consequences of the educational policies.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian history and the nationalist movement, emphasizing factual recall and analysis, with plausible distractors to increase difficulty.

**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian nationalist movement (pre-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderate nationalists' primary method involved constitutional agitation within legal boundaries, aiming for gradual, orderly political progress.
2.  All nationalists of this period adhered to the moderate approach; there was no dissenting voice advocating for more assertive political and economic strategies.
3.  The British authorities consistently expressed overt hostility towards the nationalist movement from its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Moderate nationalists' approach. They prioritized constitutional methods, believing in gradual reform through petitions, meetings, and legal means.  They aimed to influence British policy through persuasion rather than confrontation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Moderate approach dominated the early phase, there were dissenting voices advocating more assertive strategies. Leaders like Tilak and others represented a more radical, extremist faction who believed in a more aggressive approach to achieving self-government.  Their methods included direct action and challenging British authority more forcefully.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While the British authorities were indeed hostile to the nationalist movement, their hostility wasn't always openly expressed in the early stages. There was a period of cautious observation and even attempts to co-opt the movement before open criticism and suppression became the norm. The initial British response was a mix of tolerance, skepticism, and subtle attempts to control the movement's trajectory.


**2. With reference to the Partition of Bengal (1905) and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Partition was solely driven by administrative concerns; it had no implications for Bengali language, culture, or nationalism.
2.  The Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, a direct response to the Partition, involved only the participation of Bengal's militant nationalists; moderate nationalists remained uninvolved.
3.  The movement significantly boosted Indian industries, leading to the establishment of numerous textile mills, soap factories, and national banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Partition of Bengal was viewed by many as a deliberate attempt to weaken Bengali nationalism and cultural unity by dividing the province. It had significant implications for Bengali identity and the nationalist movement.  The decision was perceived not only as an administrative measure but also as a political maneuver aimed at dividing and ruling.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anti-Partition Movement saw collaboration between both moderate and militant nationalists. While the militant nationalists adopted more aggressive tactics later, the initial stages saw cooperation between both groups in opposing the partition. The movement’s success stemmed from this broad-based support.

Statement 3 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a key element of the Anti-Partition agitation, significantly stimulated Indian industries.  There was a surge in the establishment of indigenous industries, promoting self-reliance and economic nationalism. This marked a turning point in the development of Indian industries.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's primary focus was solely on resolving the Khilafat issue; concerns for the Punjab atrocities were secondary.
2.  The movement saw unprecedented Hindu-Muslim unity, symbolized by instances like Swami Shraddhanand preaching in a Delhi mosque.
3.  The movement resulted in the immediate establishment of Swaraj (self-rule).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement had dual objectives: addressing the Khilafat issue (concerning the Ottoman Caliphate) and protesting against the injustices of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the Rowlatt Act, which significantly impacted the Punjab region.  Both issues fueled the movement's momentum.

Statement 2 is correct. The movement showcased remarkable Hindu-Muslim unity, exemplified by the incident of Swami Shraddhanand, a prominent Hindu leader, addressing a Muslim congregation.  This collaboration highlighted the shared goal of opposing British rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the movement significantly strengthened nationalist sentiment and broadened participation, it did not lead to the immediate achievement of Swaraj.  The movement was suspended after the Chauri Chaura incident, and Swaraj remained a long-term goal.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary terrorist movement in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, was primarily focused on achieving independence through non-violent means.
2.  Bhagat Singh and his comrades' assassination of a British police officer was intended as a purely symbolic act, without aiming for actual harm.
3.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, involved the participation of young women revolutionaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), advocated armed revolution as the means to achieve independence. Their activities involved violent acts against the British. The group's ideology evolved to incorporate socialist ideals, but their methods remained inherently violent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhagat Singh and his comrades aimed to make a political statement, the assassination of the police officer was a violent act that resulted in death.  Their actions were intended to be impactful and demonstrate their commitment to armed struggle.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid saw the active participation of women revolutionaries, highlighting the broader involvement of women in the revolutionary movement.  This participation underscores the movement's inclusive nature and the contributions of women in the struggle for independence.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act fully satisfied the nationalist aspirations for self-government and complete independence.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting increased power to provincial legislatures and ministers.
3.  The federal part of the Act, involving the integration of British India and Princely States, was successfully implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, fell far short of fulfilling the nationalist demand for complete independence.  While it introduced some reforms, it retained significant British control and did not grant dominion status. The Act was a step towards self-government but not a complete realization of nationalist goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did introduce a system of provincial autonomy, granting more power to provincial legislatures and ministers responsible to them.  This was a significant development in the devolution of power, though the Governors retained substantial authority.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The federal part of the Act, which aimed to integrate British India and the Princely States into a federation, was never implemented. The plan faced significant opposition and was ultimately abandoned. The failure to implement the federal provisions underscores the limitations and complexities of the Act.


**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1858-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on constitutional agitation and gradual political progress, believing in the inherent justice of the British system.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's advocacy for "Swarajya" within the British Empire, as exemplified in his writings and speeches, was a significant departure from the purely reformist approach.
3.  The nationalists' economic reforms primarily focused on promoting indigenous industries through Swadeshi and boycotting British goods, while simultaneously advocating for the development of modern industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the early nationalist movement.  Statement 1 correctly describes the moderate approach of many early nationalists, who initially prioritized working *within* the existing British system to achieve incremental reforms.  They believed in presenting their demands through petitions, meetings, and resolutions, hoping for gradual concessions.  This approach, while seemingly passive, was a strategic choice given the power imbalance and the potential for immediate repression.

Statement 2 is accurate. Dadabhai Naoroji's advocacy for "Swarajya" (self-rule) represented a significant shift. While still aiming for a position *within* the British Empire, the concept of self-government, even within a larger framework, represented a bolder vision than the purely reformist goals of some contemporaries.  His work, including his famous "Drain of Wealth" theory, highlighted the exploitative nature of British rule and fueled the demand for greater autonomy.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The early nationalists strongly advocated for Swadeshi (the use of Indian-made goods) and boycotts of British goods as a means of promoting Indian industries and reducing economic dependence on Britain.  This was coupled with a call for the development of modern industries, often suggesting government intervention through tariff protection and direct aid. This dual approach reflected a desire to revive traditional industries while also embracing modern industrialization as a path to economic self-sufficiency.  The burning of foreign clothes in 1896 exemplifies this commitment to Swadeshi.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate and nuanced reflections on the multifaceted nature of the early nationalist movement's goals and strategies.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement's approach to administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The nationalists vehemently opposed the separation of judicial and executive powers, viewing it as a hindrance to efficient governance.
2.  Indianization of higher administrative services was advocated on economic, political, and moral grounds by nationalists.
3.  The nationalists' demands for administrative reforms included advocating for the right of Indians to bear arms, contrasting with the British policy of disarmament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The nationalists strongly *supported* the separation of judicial and executive powers. This was seen as crucial for ensuring fairness and impartiality in the administration of justice.  The fusion of these powers under the British system often led to arbitrary actions and denial of justice, particularly when Europeans were involved. The demand for separation was a key aspect of their efforts to create a more just and equitable system.

Statement 2 is correct. The nationalists consistently advocated for the Indianization of higher administrative services.  Their arguments were multifaceted: economically, it would reduce the high cost of employing Europeans; politically, it would make the administration more responsive to Indian needs; and morally, it would end the sense of inferiority imposed on Indians by the near-total European monopoly of higher positions in the services.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale's powerful articulation of the moral dimension of this issue is well-known.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The British policy of disarming the Indian population was a source of major concern for the nationalists. They viewed this as an attempt to suppress the Indian people and prevent them from defending themselves and their country.  Therefore, they actively advocated for the right of Indians to bear arms, emphasizing the importance of self-defense and national security.  This reflects their broader concern about the erosion of civil liberties under British rule.


**3. With reference to the impact of the rediscovery of India's past on the nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The rediscovery of India's past primarily focused on the ancient period, neglecting the contributions of the medieval period, thereby inadvertently fostering communal tensions.
2. The rediscovery of India's rich cultural heritage was instrumental in boosting national self-confidence and countering British propaganda that portrayed India as inherently incapable of self-rule.
3.  The uncritical glorification of India's past, ignoring its weaknesses and backwardness, led to a false sense of pride and hindered the necessary social and cultural reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the complex and multifaceted impact of the rediscovery of India's past on the nationalist movement. Statement 1 is correct because the initial emphasis on the ancient period, while understandable given the need to counter British narratives, did lead to a relative neglect of the medieval period's contributions. This imbalance, unintentionally, contributed to the rise of communal tensions, as different religious groups selectively emphasized historical periods that favored their narratives.

Statement 2 is correct as the rediscovery of India's rich cultural and historical heritage played a crucial role in bolstering national self-confidence.  By highlighting India's past achievements in various fields—art, architecture, literature, philosophy, science, and politics—nationalist leaders effectively countered British propaganda that depicted Indians as inherently incapable of self-governance. This rediscovery provided a powerful counter-narrative, fostering a sense of national pride and a belief in India's capacity for self-rule.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The uncritical glorification of India's past, while intended to inspire patriotism, also had its drawbacks.  By ignoring the weaknesses and backwardness present in various aspects of Indian society, this approach created a false sense of superiority and hindered the much-needed social and cultural reforms.  This unrealistic portrayal of the past created obstacles to self-critical reflection and the adoption of progressive ideas and practices.  The tendency to ignore the medieval period is a prime example of this selective approach.  The interplay between these three aspects makes the overall impact of the rediscovery of India's past a complex and nuanced issue, worthy of detailed analysis.


**4. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INC, from its inception, was solely a platform for the educated elite, with minimal engagement with the wider masses.
2.  The participation of women in the INC's activities was largely symbolic in the early years, with limited actual influence on decision-making processes.
3.  The initial demands of the INC focused primarily on constitutional reforms, such as the expansion and reform of legislative councils, with economic issues taking a secondary role.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INC's initial membership was predominantly composed of the educated elite—lawyers, journalists, traders, industrialists, teachers, and landlords—it's inaccurate to say that it had *no* engagement with the wider masses. The INC's activities and demands aimed to address the concerns of the broader Indian population, even if the direct participation of the masses was limited in the early years. The movement gradually expanded its reach and influence beyond the educated elite.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  While Kadambini Ganguli's address to the Congress session in 1890 is symbolic of the growing role of women, their actual participation and influence within the INC's decision-making processes remained limited in the early years.  The movement's focus on the educated elite naturally limited the representation of women, who were largely excluded from the formal structures of power at that time. However, it's important to acknowledge that women played increasingly significant roles in later stages of the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct.  In its early years, the INC's primary focus was on securing constitutional reforms.  Their main demands revolved around expanding and reforming the legislative councils, increasing Indian representation, and enhancing the councils' powers.  While economic issues were certainly present in their discourse, they were initially secondary to the pursuit of political representation and participation within the British governmental framework.  The emphasis shifted towards economic concerns as the movement evolved.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 accurately capture the nuances of the INC's early years.


**5. With reference to the methods employed by the early nationalists in their political work, consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists relied heavily on underground revolutionary activities and violent uprisings to challenge British rule.
2.  The early nationalists employed a two-pronged strategy: building up public opinion in India and simultaneously working to influence British public opinion.
3. The early nationalists' professions of loyalty to British rule were a sign of their lack of patriotism or cowardice, hindering the movement's progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early nationalist movement, in its initial phase, predominantly employed constitutional and non-violent methods.  While revolutionary activities emerged later, they were not the primary focus of the early nationalists. Their strategy emphasized working within the existing system to advocate for reforms and gradually expand Indian participation in governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The early nationalists pursued a two-pronged strategy.  They worked to build a strong public opinion within India, raising political consciousness and uniting the people on key issues.  Simultaneously, they actively sought to influence British public opinion, sending deputations to Britain, engaging in propaganda, and establishing organizations such as the British Committee of the Indian National Congress to convey the Indian perspective.  This dual approach was crucial to their efforts to garner both domestic support and international pressure for reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The early nationalists' professions of loyalty to the British Crown should not be interpreted as a sign of lack of patriotism or cowardice.  This was a strategic approach, aimed at avoiding immediate and harsh repression from the British government.  Many believed that demonstrating loyalty while simultaneously demanding reforms was a more effective way to achieve their goals in the context of the existing power dynamics.  Their loyalty was conditional and often shifted as British actions demonstrated their unwillingness to grant substantial reforms.  Their actions and demands, rather than their expressions of loyalty, are the true measure of their patriotism. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the early nationalists' methods.


**1. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, S. Satyamurthy, and B.C. Roy advocated for a constitutional struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend, favored the resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle, criticizing both constructive work and council entry as diversions from anti-colonial action.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later conceded to allow Congressmen to participate in legislatures, provided they didn't become engrossed in constitutionalism or self-serving politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the multifaceted debates within the Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies a group of Congress leaders who championed constitutional methods and electoral participation as a means to maintain political momentum and build Congress strength.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Nehru's leftist perspective, emphasizing the continuation of mass struggle and rejecting the "spiritual defeat" of constructive work and council entry.  Statement 3 correctly describes Gandhi's evolving position on office acceptance, highlighting his pragmatic approach to reconcile differing viewpoints within the Congress while ensuring the movement's revolutionary character wasn't compromised. The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of at least one of the statements. The nuances of the internal Congress debates, highlighting the differing strategies and ideological positions, are crucial for understanding this pivotal period in Indian history.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, but its formation was contingent upon the princely states fulfilling specific population and participation criteria.
2.  Provincial autonomy replaced dyarchy, granting provinces separate legal identities, independent financial powers, and greater legislative autonomy, although the Governor retained significant special powers.
3. The Act introduced a bicameral legislature at the federal level, with a Council of States (upper house) and a Federal Assembly (lower house),  but the system of communal electorates was further extended, and a significant portion of the budget remained non-votable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a complex piece of legislation with far-reaching consequences.  Statement 1 accurately describes the proposed All-India Federation, which ultimately failed to materialize due to the non-fulfillment of conditions related to princely state participation.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the shift from dyarchy to provincial autonomy, granting provinces increased self-governance while acknowledging the Governor's retention of substantial special powers, particularly concerning minorities and law and order.  Statement 3 accurately describes the bicameral federal legislature, noting the continued use of communal electorates—a significant feature that exacerbated communal tensions—and the substantial portion of the budget that remained outside the legislature's control. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one of the crucial aspects of the 1935 Act detailed in the statements. Understanding the Act's provisions is essential for analyzing the political dynamics of the pre-independence era, particularly regarding the balance of power between the British and Indian political actors.


**3. With reference to the 1937 Provincial Elections and their aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress won a majority in most provinces, resulting in the formation of Congress ministries, but there were significant differences within the Congress regarding office acceptance.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose, and Congress socialists opposed office acceptance, arguing it would negate the rejection of the 1935 Act and compromise the revolutionary character of the movement.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but ultimately gave his approval, leading to the formation of Congress ministries in several provinces, although the Congress officially maintained its opposition to the 1935 Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1937 provincial elections and the subsequent debate on office acceptance were defining moments in the Indian freedom struggle. Statement 1 accurately reflects the Congress's electoral success and the resulting formation of ministries, while acknowledging the internal divisions within the party regarding the strategy of office acceptance. Statement 2 correctly identifies the leftist opposition to office acceptance, highlighting their concerns about compromising the revolutionary struggle and diluting the Congress's rejection of the 1935 Act. Statement 3 correctly describes Gandhi's initial reluctance followed by his eventual acceptance of office acceptance as a strategic move, while emphasizing the Congress's continued official opposition to the 1935 Act.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete because they fail to capture the full complexity of the situation – the electoral success, the internal ideological debates, and Gandhi's pivotal role in resolving the conflict.  This period marks a significant shift in the nationalist movement's tactics and reveals the evolving relationship between the Congress and the British government.


**4. With reference to the post-independence political developments under Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress secured a massive majority in the 1952 general elections, forming the government at the Centre under Nehru's leadership, and Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of India.
2.  The debate on the national language resulted in Hindi being designated as the official language, with English retaining its status as an associate official language for a transitional period, although resentment against Hindi persisted in non-Hindi-speaking regions.
3.  The linguistic reorganization of states, driven by demands based on linguistic pluralism, was initially opposed by the national leadership but eventually led to the formation of new states based on linguistic lines, following the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC).

Statement 1 accurately describes the formation, initial success, and subsequent fragmentation of the PSP due to internal ideological differences. Statement 2 correctly explains the split within the CPI, leading to the formation of the CPM, primarily driven by the Sino-Soviet rift and differing responses to the 1962 war.  Statement 3 accurately details the BJS's initial ideology and its later pragmatic shift on the Hindi language issue to broaden its appeal. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, failing to capture the complexities and transformations within the Indian political landscape during the Nehruvian era. Understanding the evolution of these parties is crucial for analyzing the Indian political spectrum and the dynamics of opposition to the Congress during this period.


**6.  With reference to Nehru's economic policies and the Five-Year Plans, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Five-Year Plan prioritized agrarian development, focusing on irrigation and large-scale projects, while the Second Five-Year Plan, under Mahalanobis's leadership, emphasized heavy industries and a "socialistic pattern of society."
2.  Nehru's economic model was a "mixed economy," combining elements of capitalism and socialism, with the state controlling key industries and infrastructure while leaving much of agriculture, trade, and industry in private hands.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the source material, creating multiple high-quality, difficult MCQs that fully utilize the 8192 token limit is challenging.  I've included several questions, aiming for a balance of difficulty and coverage.


**1. With reference to the events leading to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report, approved at the Calcutta Congress Session of 1928, initially advocated for dominion status, but faced opposition from younger Congress leaders who demanded Purna Swaraj.
2.  Lord Irwin's declaration of October 31, 1929, unequivocally promised Dominion Status within a specific timeframe, thus resolving the concerns of older Congress leaders.
3. The Delhi Manifesto, issued in November 1929, outlined conditions for attending the Round Table Conferences, including immediate acceptance of Dominion Status as a basic principle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Calcutta Session did approve the Nehru Report advocating dominion status, but younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Satyamurthy successfully pushed for Purna Swaraj as the ultimate goal.  The older generation, while initially hesitant, eventually conceded to a shorter timeframe for achieving dominion status before resorting to civil disobedience.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lord Irwin's declaration, while mentioning Dominion Status as the eventual goal of British policy, notably lacked a specific timeframe for its attainment. This ambiguity was a significant factor in fueling the demand for Purna Swaraj.

Statement 3 is correct. The Delhi Manifesto did indeed lay down conditions for participating in the Round Table Conferences, including the immediate acceptance of Dominion Status as a fundamental principle and a significant Congress representation.  Lord Irwin's refusal to meet these demands further escalated the situation.  The other options are incorrect because they either include the factually inaccurate statement 2 or omit the correct statements 1 and 3.


**2. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, signed in March 1931, resulted in the unconditional release of all political prisoners, regardless of the nature of their crimes.
2.  The Congress, as part of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, agreed to participate in the Second Round Table Conference, focusing on key constitutional issues like federation and minority safeguards.
3. The execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru just days before the Karachi Congress Session in March 1931, significantly impacted the Congress's reception of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact secured the release of many political prisoners but explicitly excluded those convicted of violence.  The government's refusal to commute the death sentences of Bhagat Singh and his comrades was a major point of contention.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key component of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was the Congress's agreement to suspend the Civil Disobedience Movement and participate in the Second Round Table Conference, focusing on federal structure, Indian responsibility, and necessary safeguards for minorities.

Statement 3 is correct. The timing of the executions, shortly before the Karachi Congress session, created a significant tension and impacted the atmosphere surrounding the Pact's endorsement.  Many within the Congress felt betrayed by Gandhi's inability to secure the commutation of the death sentences.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. With reference to the Second Round Table Conference (RTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Second RTC, held in London from September to December 1931, saw Gandhi as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The conference resulted in a substantial agreement on India's constitutional future, leading to the immediate implementation of a responsible government at the center.
3.  The Second RTC was significantly influenced by the change in the British government from a Labour government to a National Government, which held a more conservative stance on Indian self-rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi was indeed the sole representative of the Indian National Congress at the Second RTC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Second RTC ended without a substantial agreement on India's constitutional future.  The conference was deadlocked on the issue of minority representation, particularly separate electorates, and failed to yield a concrete plan for the transfer of power.  A responsible government at the center was far from being immediately implemented.

Statement 3 is correct. The change in the British government from a Labour to a National Government did significantly impact the Second RTC.  The new government, dominated by conservatives, was less inclined to compromise on issues of Indian self-rule and held a more resistant stance towards the Congress' demands. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Communal Award and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award, announced in 1932, established separate electorates for various minority groups, including the depressed classes, and allocated a significant number of reserved seats for them.
2. The Poona Pact, signed in 1932, retained the concept of separate electorates for the depressed classes but significantly increased the number of reserved seats allocated to them.
3. Gandhi's fast unto death in 1932 played a crucial role in securing the Poona Pact, which ultimately led to the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes in favor of increased reserved seats within joint electorates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Communal Award did indeed introduce separate electorates for various minority groups, including the depressed classes, along with reserved seats.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Poona Pact's most significant feature was the *abolition* of separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with a larger number of reserved seats within joint electorates. The number of seats was increased, but the fundamental change was the shift from separate to joint electorates.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's fast unto death exerted immense pressure, leading to negotiations and the signing of the Poona Pact, which resolved the issue of separate electorates for the depressed classes. Thus, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**5.  With reference to the debates on future strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate post-CDM debate within the Congress centered on the choice between focusing on Gandhian constructive work and engaging in constitutional politics through electoral participation.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend, advocated for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience, rejecting both constructive work and electoral participation as distractions from the primary goal of anti-colonial struggle.
3. The Government of India Act of 1935, passed amidst the 1932 struggle, introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, but retained significant "safeguards" and "special responsibilities" for the Governor, limiting the extent of self-rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The post-CDM debate within the Congress revolved around two main approaches: Gandhi's emphasis on constructive work and the strategy of participating in elections and legislative councils to maintain political momentum.

Statement 2 is correct. Nehru, representing a leftist perspective, strongly criticized the emphasis on constructive work and electoral participation, arguing that these diverted attention from direct action against colonial rule and advocated for continuing the mass struggle.

Statement 3 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 did introduce provincial autonomy, but crucially retained significant "safeguards" and "special responsibilities" for the Governor, which considerably limited the extent of self-governance granted to the provinces.  These provisions served as a major point of contention for the Congress.  All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the historical context.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding British administrative policies in India post-1857:**

1. The British pursued a "divide and rule" policy, exacerbating existing tensions between various groups to maintain control.
2.  The British actively fostered alliances with Zamindars and landlords, utilizing them as a counterweight against nationalist-minded intellectuals.
3.  The British consistently supported social reforms aimed at modernizing Indian society, viewing them as crucial for progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The British post-1857 adopted a policy of "divide and rule" to maintain their dominance in India. This involved exploiting existing social and religious divisions between Hindus and Muslims, as well as pitting different regions, castes, and classes against each other. This approach is well-documented and formed a cornerstone of British imperial strategy.  Statement 1 is thus correct.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Recognizing the potential threat posed by the rising nationalist intelligentsia, the British strategically allied themselves with conservative elements within Indian society, particularly the Zamindars and landlords. By supporting their interests and privileges, the British sought to create a counterbalance against the growing nationalist movement. This strategy aimed at weakening the nationalist movement by dividing its potential support base.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Contrary to the assertion, the British largely reversed their earlier, albeit hesitant, support for social reforms after 1857.  Fearing that social reforms might further destabilize their rule by alienating conservative groups, they actively withdrew support for progressive movements and instead favored maintaining the status quo. This is a crucial aspect of understanding the conservative shift in British policy post-1857.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted Zamindars proprietary rights over their land in exchange for a fixed revenue payment.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots).
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities (mahals).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of the major British revenue systems in India.  The Permanent Settlement (Statement 1) aimed to establish a stable and predictable revenue stream by granting Zamindars proprietary rights. While it had some positive aspects initially, it also led to several negative consequences such as absentee landlordism and exploitation of the peasantry.

The Ryotwari System (Statement 2) was designed for direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries.  While aiming for greater efficiency, this system often resulted in overassessment and hardship for the ryots due to inaccurate land surveys and inflexible tax rates.

The Mahalwari System (Statement 3) attempted to balance individual and collective responsibility by assessing revenue at the village community level (mahal).  However, this system also suffered from flaws including inaccurate assessments and corruption, leading to similar issues of exploitation as other systems.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the core characteristics of these distinct revenue systems.


**3. With reference to the British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs, but this changed significantly after 1813.
2. The rise of industrial capitalism in Britain, coupled with intellectual and revolutionary movements in Europe, influenced British policies towards social reform in India.
3. Christian missionaries actively supported the British imperial agenda and sought to spread Christianity through westernization, often undermining Indian culture and beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Before 1813, the British largely adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious matters. However, the subsequent period saw a shift in policy influenced by several factors discussed in Statement 2.  This change in policy is a significant turning point in understanding the complexities of British rule in India.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the key factors that led to the change in British policy. The Industrial Revolution in Britain created a demand for new markets and resources from India. Simultaneously, the intellectual and revolutionary movements in Europe, including the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, influenced British attitudes towards Indian society and culture.  This led to both attempts at social reform and increased attempts at cultural domination.

Statement 3 is also correct.  Christian missionaries played a significant role in shaping British policies, often acting as agents of both cultural change and imperial expansion. They actively supported the British in their efforts to establish control over India, while simultaneously seeking to convert Indians to Christianity. This missionary activity often involved undermining traditional Indian beliefs and practices, exacerbating the cultural tensions of the colonial period.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.


**4. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British sought to establish natural geographical frontiers for India to enhance internal cohesion and defense.
2. A key aim of British foreign policy was to contain the influence of other European powers in Asia and Africa to protect their interests.
3. British foreign policy decisions often resulted in conflicts with neighboring countries, with the costs and consequences primarily borne by India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of British foreign policy in India.  The British aimed to establish secure borders for their Indian empire, both to enhance internal stability and to prevent external threats. This involved military expeditions and territorial acquisitions in neighboring regions, often leading to conflicts.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The British actively sought to limit the influence of other European powers—particularly France and Russia—in Asia and Africa. This was a core tenet of their imperial strategy, driven by the desire to protect their trade routes, resources, and overall dominance in the region.  This competitive aspect of imperialism is central to understanding British actions in this context.

Statement 3 is accurate.  British foreign policy in India frequently led to conflicts with neighboring countries, such as the Anglo-Afghan Wars, the Anglo-Burmese Wars, and the Anglo-Nepalese War.  While these were driven by British imperial interests, the costs, both in human lives and financial resources, were largely borne by India. This highlights the exploitative nature of British imperialism and its disproportionate impact on the Indian population. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about the British policy towards princely states in India:**

1. The policy of annexation was largely abandoned after the 1857 Revolt, replaced by a policy of subordinate union.
2.  The British government exercised paramountcy, interfering in the internal affairs of princely states through Residents and by appointing/dismissing officials.
3. The Chamber of Princes, established under the Montford Reforms, gave princely states significant power in the governance of British India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 1857 Revolt prompted a significant shift in British policy towards princely states.  While annexation had been a common practice before 1857, the British recognized the need to cultivate the loyalty of the princes and avoid further uprisings. This resulted in a shift towards a policy of “subordinate union,” where the princely states remained nominally independent but were ultimately subject to British control.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The British maintained their dominance over the princely states through the concept of paramountcy. This involved the exercise of considerable influence over the states’ internal affairs. British Residents were stationed in the princely courts, acting as agents of the British government and interfering in various aspects of administration.  The British also held the power to appoint and dismiss key officials within the princely states, ensuring their compliance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes, established under the Montford Reforms (1919), was primarily a consultative and advisory body.  It did not grant princely states significant power in the governance of British India.  The Chamber’s role was limited, and it lacked real power to influence major policy decisions.  The princely states remained largely subordinate to the British government despite the establishment of this body.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects within the context of the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement's initial phase primarily involved boycotts of British goods and institutions, later escalating to include mass civil disobedience.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, directly led to the movement's suspension by Gandhi.
3.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from diverse social groups, including peasants, students, and women, but saw limited involvement from the business class.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement began with a program of non-violent non-cooperation, including boycotts of British goods, schools, colleges, and courts.  This was followed by a planned escalation to mass civil disobedience, although this phase was cut short.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob set fire to a police station, resulting in deaths, was a pivotal event that led Gandhi to abruptly suspend the movement due to concerns about escalating violence.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the movement did involve significant participation from peasants, students, and women, the business class also played a role, although some segments remained skeptical due to fears of labor unrest.  Their participation was not "limited," but rather complex and varied in its level of commitment.  The movement's impact on different social strata varied, making a blanket statement about limited business participation inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the factors contributing to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic hardship caused by World War I, including inflation and increased taxation, fueled widespread discontent.
2. The Rowlatt Act, which curtailed civil liberties, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre significantly intensified anti-British sentiment.
3. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, though intended to grant greater Indian autonomy, completely satisfied Indian demands for self-government, thereby removing a major cause for agitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the post-World War I economic situation in India, which exacerbated existing grievances and contributed to the climate of unrest.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as catalysts for widespread anger and resistance. These events exposed the repressive nature of British rule and galvanized public opinion against the government. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing some limited self-governance (dyarchy), fell far short of meeting Indian aspirations for complete self-rule.  The reforms' inadequacy actually fueled further demands for greater autonomy and contributed to the rise of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The failure to satisfy Indian demands was a key factor leading to the movement.


**3.  With reference to the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was primarily concerned with protecting the Ottoman Caliphate and Muslim holy places from Allied intervention after World War I.
2.  The movement's success was largely dependent on the cooperation and support of the Indian National Congress, particularly under Gandhi's leadership.
3. The Khilafat Movement's primary objective was to establish complete independence for India, and the Caliphate issue served as a secondary tool.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Khilafat Movement stemmed from the outrage among Indian Muslims over the treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I. The fear of the Caliphate's demise and the potential threat to Muslim holy sites were central concerns. Statement 2 is correct because the Congress's support, especially under Gandhi's leadership, was crucial for the movement's widespread mobilization. The joint Hindu-Muslim platform provided by the combined movements was a key factor in their initial success. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Khilafat Movement did contribute to the broader anti-imperialist struggle, its primary focus was the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate and the religious and cultural sentiments associated with it, not directly the establishment of Indian independence. Indian independence was a secondary goal that became more prominent as the movement progressed.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement's impact:**

1. The movement successfully achieved its primary goal of immediate complete independence for India.
2. The movement significantly strengthened the Indian National Congress's organizational structure and expanded its reach across the country.
3. The movement's failure to secure its immediate goals led to a period of disillusionment and a reassessment of strategies within the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement did not achieve its primary goal of immediate and complete independence for India.  The movement was suspended prematurely, and independence remained a long-term goal. Statement 2 is correct. The movement significantly boosted the Congress's organizational strength, expanding its base across India.  The establishment of national schools and colleges, and the mobilization of volunteers, demonstrated the Congress's growing organizational capabilities. Statement 3 is also correct. The movement's premature end due to the Chauri Chaura incident and the overall failure to achieve its immediate goals resulted in a period of introspection and strategizing within the nationalist movement, leading to the exploration of alternative approaches.  This period of reassessment was crucial in shaping the future direction of the freedom struggle.


**5. With reference to the aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajist party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for participation in legislative councils to obstruct government policies.
2. The "No-changers" within the Congress, led by figures like Rajendra Prasad, opposed Council entry, preferring to focus on constructive programs.
3. The period following the movement witnessed a surge in Hindu-Muslim unity, with communal tensions effectively resolved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the Swarajist approach, which aimed to utilize legislative councils as a platform for opposition and to expose the weaknesses of the British administration. Statement 2 accurately portrays the "No-changers'" position, who believed that focusing on constructive work and social reform was more effective than participating in legislative bodies.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The period following the Non-Cooperation Movement saw a significant rise in communal tensions and violence, contrary to the assertion of resolved communal harmony.  The failure of the movement to fully unite Hindus and Muslims exacerbated existing fault lines.  Communal riots increased significantly after 1923.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-22), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee report significantly fueled the discontent leading to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, primarily impacted urban Muslims and had minimal influence on the broader national movement.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the perceived injustice of the Hunter Committee's report on the Punjab atrocities significantly contributed to widespread anger and resentment against British rule, providing a fertile ground for the Non-Cooperation Movement. These events exposed the brutal nature of colonial power and fueled the desire for self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Khilafat issue initially focused on the plight of Muslims in the Ottoman Empire, it played a crucial role in uniting Hindus and Muslims within the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The shared grievances and the joint struggle against British rule fostered a sense of national unity, broadening the movement's reach beyond specific religious concerns.  The participation of a significant number of Muslims, including both urban and rural populations, demonstrates its wider impact.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors attacked and burned a police station, resulting in the death of policemen, deeply disturbed Mahatma Gandhi. He believed that the incident demonstrated a lack of adherence to non-violent principles, ultimately leading him to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement to prevent its escalation into a violent uprising.  This decision, while controversial at the time, highlights Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence as the cornerstone of the movement's success.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily employed constitutional methods, such as petitions and resolutions, to pressure the British government for reforms, while avoiding direct confrontation.
2.  The demand for Swaraj, or self-government, emerged only after the partition of Bengal in 1905, as a direct response to the perceived injustice of the British government.
3.  Economic reforms advocated by early nationalists included promoting swadeshi (use of Indian goods), boycotting British goods, and addressing the drain of wealth from India to Britain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), often referred to as the Moderate phase, was characterized by a reliance on constitutional methods of political engagement.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others primarily focused on petitions, resolutions, and appeals to British public opinion to advocate for reforms within the existing political framework. While there was growing discontent, the emphasis was on gradual, peaceful progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The demand for Swaraj, or self-government, was not solely a post-1905 phenomenon. While the partition of Bengal acted as a catalyst, intensifying nationalist sentiment and leading to more radical approaches, the concept of self-rule was already being discussed and advocated by some nationalist leaders before 1905.  The demand gained momentum in the early 20th century, reflecting a growing desire for greater autonomy and eventual independence from British rule.

Statement 3 is correct. The early nationalists were deeply concerned about India's economic exploitation under British rule.  Their economic agenda included promoting swadeshi (the use of Indian-made goods) to bolster domestic industries, boycotting British goods to reduce economic dependence, and highlighting the “drain of wealth” from India to Britain as a major source of India's impoverishment. These economic concerns were intertwined with their political goals, recognizing the need for economic self-reliance to achieve true independence.


**3. With reference to Sayyid Ahmad Khan and his contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's primary focus was on religious reform within the Muslim community, advocating for modernization and a rejection of certain traditional practices.
2.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan wholeheartedly supported the rising nationalist movement, actively participating in the Indian National Congress and advocating for complete independence from British rule.
3. The Aligarh School, associated with Sayyid Ahmad Khan, comprised a group of loyal followers who promoted Western education and advocated for the modernization of Muslim society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's major contribution lay in his efforts towards religious and social reform within the Muslim community. He advocated for a more rational and modern interpretation of Islam, urging Muslims to adopt a progressive outlook and reject certain traditional practices that he considered outdated or harmful. His work aimed to reconcile Islamic faith with modern scientific and educational advancements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan's stance toward the rising nationalist movement was complex and not one of wholehearted support. While he advocated for certain reforms and improvements within the British Indian administration, he was wary of the nationalist movement's growing influence and believed that Muslims needed to focus on education and social reform before engaging in broader political activism. He did not actively participate in the Indian National Congress nor advocate for complete independence.  His caution stemmed from a concern that premature political action could hinder the progress of the Muslim community.

Statement 3 is correct. The Aligarh School, a group of intellectuals and reformers associated with Sayyid Ahmad Khan, played a significant role in promoting Western education and advocating for the modernization of Muslim society. They established institutions such as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim University), which emphasized modern scientific and liberal education, aimed at equipping Muslims with the skills and knowledge to participate in the modern world.  The Aligarh School's influence extended beyond education, impacting various aspects of Muslim society and culture.


**4. With reference to the impact of British land revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, resulted in the empowerment of ryots (peasants) and strengthened their land ownership rights.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed at direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, often leading to overassessment and exploitation.
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, involved revenue assessment at the village level, fostering community ownership and mitigating the exploitation of individual cultivators.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, while granting proprietary rights to zamindars, did not empower ryots.  Instead, it created a system of absentee landlordism, leaving ryots vulnerable to exploitation and high rents from zamindars who often had little incentive to improve agricultural practices.  The system ultimately led to the impoverishment of many peasants.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari System, while aiming for direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, often resulted in overassessment of land revenue. This overassessment, coupled with inflexible revenue demands, frequently pushed ryots into debt and poverty. The system lacked mechanisms to account for variations in agricultural yields and market prices, leading to significant hardship for cultivators.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Mahalwari System assessed revenue at the village level, it did not necessarily foster community ownership or mitigate exploitation.  The system often resulted in unequal distribution of tax burdens within the village, and the village headman (lambardar) could sometimes exploit the system for personal gain.  Like the other systems, it also suffered from issues of overassessment and harsh collection practices, leading to peasant impoverishment.  The village community was often not effectively protected under this system.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on various aspects of Indian Polity and Governance during the early nationalist movement.


**1. Consider the following statements about the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905):**

1.  Early nationalists primarily advocated for immediate complete independence from British rule.
2.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 significantly increased Indian representation and power in legislative councils, fully satisfying nationalist demands.
3.  The "drain of wealth" theory, articulated by nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory was a cornerstone of early nationalist economic critique, arguing that British policies systematically depleted India's resources.  This analysis was crucial in shaping nationalist sentiment and demands for economic reforms.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The early nationalist phase (1885-1905) was characterized by a moderate approach.  While the ultimate goal was self-government, the immediate demands were for increased Indian participation in governance and administrative reforms, not immediate complete independence.  The demand for *Swaraj* (self-rule) evolved gradually.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils and allow for some indirect elections of Indian members. However, it did not grant significant power to Indians; officials retained a majority, and the councils’ powers remained limited.  Nationalists considered the Act inadequate and continued to press for greater reforms.


**2. With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INC's first session was held in Calcutta in 1885 under the presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji.
2.  The INC, from its inception, exclusively focused on mass mobilization and direct action against the British Raj.
3.  Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose were key figures in establishing the Indian National Conference, a precursor to the INC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose played a vital role in forming the Indian National Conference, which laid the groundwork for the later establishment of the INC.  This demonstrates the gradual evolution of organized nationalist activity.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INC's first session was held in 1885, it was in Bombay, not Calcutta, and Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee presided, not Dadabhai Naoroji (who later became president multiple times). This highlights the importance of accurately remembering key details of the INC's early years.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The INC's early years (the "Moderate Phase") were characterized by constitutional methods, petitions, and appeals to the British government for reforms, not a primary focus on mass mobilization and direct action.  This approach evolved significantly later in the movement's history.



**3. With reference to the economic policies advocated by early Indian nationalists (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists strongly supported the unrestricted growth of modern industries in India without any government intervention.
2.  The Swadeshi movement promoted the use of Indian-made goods and the boycott of British products as a means to boost the Indian economy.
3.  Nationalists consistently advocated for increased land revenue to enhance government revenue and fund development projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement was a crucial aspect of early nationalist economic policy, aiming to revitalize the Indian economy by promoting indigenous industries and reducing reliance on British goods.  This reflects a key strategy of economic nationalism.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While early nationalists did advocate for the development of Indian industries, they also recognized the need for government support through measures like tariff protection and direct aid to overcome the disadvantages imposed by British colonial policies.  This shows a nuanced understanding of their economic proposals.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Nationalists actually campaigned for a *reduction* in land revenue, recognizing the heavy burden it placed on Indian peasants and its contribution to widespread poverty. This demonstrates their concern for the welfare of the rural population.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the early Indian nationalists' approach to constitutional reforms:**

1.  Early nationalists initially demanded complete independence from British rule, rejecting any form of cooperation with the colonial government.
2.  The demand for "No taxation without representation" echoed the American cry for self-governance and reflected the growing desire for Indian participation in governance.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 fully granted Indian control over the national budget, marking a significant step towards self-rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The slogan "No taxation without representation" directly mirrored the American revolutionary cry and symbolized the early nationalists' growing demand for a greater voice in governance and control over India's finances. This demonstrates the influence of other democratic movements on Indian nationalism.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Early nationalists, during the Moderate Phase, favored a gradual approach to self-governance.  While their ultimate aim was self-rule, their initial strategies involved working within the existing system to secure reforms, not outright rejection of cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did not grant Indian control over the budget.  While it allowed for some discussion of the budget, the ultimate authority remained with the British government.  This highlights the limitations of the reforms offered by the British.


**5. With reference to the administrative reforms desired by early Indian nationalists, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nationalists primarily advocated for the complete removal of all British officials from the Indian administration.
2.  The demand for "Indianization" of higher administrative services was based on economic, political, and moral grounds.
3.  Nationalists strongly supported the integration of judicial and executive powers within the administration to ensure efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The demand for "Indianization" was multifaceted. Economically, it aimed to reduce administrative costs; politically, it sought to make the administration more responsive to Indian needs; and morally, it challenged the inherent discrimination of excluding Indians from higher positions. This demonstrates the comprehensive nature of nationalist demands.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Early nationalists did not advocate for the complete removal of all British officials. Their aim was to increase Indian representation and participation at all levels of administration, not a complete overhaul.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nationalists actually advocated for the *separation* of judicial and executive powers, recognizing that the combination led to potential abuses and compromised the impartiality of the judicial system.  This reflects their commitment to establishing a fair and just administration.


**1. With reference to the early years of the Indian nationalist movement (pre-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Landholders' Society, founded in 1837, primarily focused on advocating for the interests of Bengal's tenant farmers.
2.  The British Indian Association, formed through the merger of two earlier organizations, played a significant role in shaping the early stages of Indian nationalism.
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji, known as the "Grand Old Man of India," primarily focused his political activism on promoting industrialization in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Landholders' Society, established in 1837, primarily represented the interests of landlords (zamindars) in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, not tenant farmers.  Their focus was on protecting their class interests within the existing colonial framework.  The focus on tenant farmer rights emerged later in the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The British Indian Association, a result of the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society in 1851, played a crucial role in the development of early Indian nationalism. It advocated for administrative reforms, greater Indian participation in governance, and the expansion of education.  While not directly leading the nationalist movement, it laid some of the groundwork for future organized political action.  It's importance lies in its role as a precursor to more radical nationalist organizations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji was a significant figure in the early nationalist movement and made contributions to economic thought, highlighting the "drain of wealth" from India, his primary focus was not on promoting industrialization. His work concentrated more on exposing the exploitative nature of British economic policies and advocating for the political and economic betterment of India.  He emphasized self-governance and economic justice rather than solely focusing on industrial growth.


**2. With reference to the events surrounding the partition of Bengal in 1905, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary stated reason for the partition of Bengal was the overwhelming demand from the Bengali population for administrative decentralization.
2.  The Swadeshi Movement, which emerged in response to the partition, primarily focused on boycotting British educational institutions.
3.  Rabindranath Tagore's song "Amar Sonar Bangla" was written specifically in response to the partition of Bengal and later became the national anthem of Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British government claimed the partition was necessary due to Bengal's large size and administrative difficulties, this was a pretext. The real motive was to weaken the nationalist movement centered in Bengal by dividing the Bengali population along linguistic and religious lines.  The partition was a deliberate attempt at divide-and-rule tactics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Swadeshi Movement, though encompassing various forms of protest, was broader than just boycotting British educational institutions.  While the boycott of British goods and institutions was a key element, the movement also involved promoting indigenous industries, national education, and broader forms of civil disobedience.  The boycott of education was a significant part but not the sole focus.

Statement 3 is correct.  Rabindranath Tagore composed "Amar Sonar Bangla" ("My Golden Bengal") in response to the partition of Bengal. The song, expressing deep patriotic feelings for Bengal, became a powerful symbol of Bengali identity and nationalism. It was later adopted as the national anthem of Bangladesh.


**3. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms introduced universal adult suffrage in the Indian legislative councils.
2.  The reforms established separate electorates for Muslims, a move that had long been advocated by the Congress party.
3.  The reforms significantly increased the powers of the Indian legislative councils, granting them full control over the budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did *not* introduce universal adult suffrage. The electorate remained limited and based on property qualifications and communal representation.  The reforms were a far cry from granting voting rights to all adults.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of separate electorates for Muslims was a significant aspect of the reforms, but it was *not* a long-standing demand of the Indian National Congress.  The Congress opposed the policy of separate electorates, seeing it as divisive and detrimental to national unity.  It was a demand primarily pushed by certain Muslim groups seeking separate representation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did *not* grant Indian legislative councils full control over the budget. While the councils' powers were expanded somewhat, they still lacked substantial control over financial matters.  The budget remained largely under the control of the executive branch, which was dominated by British officials.  The reforms offered limited power-sharing rather than complete control.


**4. With reference to the activities of militant nationalists in India during the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anushilan Samiti was a primarily non-violent organization focused on promoting Swadeshi and boycott.
2.  Khudiram Bose was executed for his involvement in an assassination attempt on a British official.
3.  V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a secret society dedicated to the promotion of social reform within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent revolutionary organization, was known for its involvement in revolutionary activities, including violence, not solely for non-violent methods.  They used revolutionary terrorism as a means of achieving independence.  The statement misrepresents the group's activities.

Statement 2 is correct. Khudiram Bose was a key member of a revolutionary group and was executed for his participation in an attempt to assassinate a British judge in Muzaffarpur.  His execution became a symbol of the revolutionary struggle.

Statement 3 is incorrect. V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a secret revolutionary society.  While some revolutionary groups did engage in social reform as part of a broader nationalist agenda, Abhinava Bharat's main focus was on overthrowing British rule through revolutionary means, not primarily on social reform.  The statement misrepresents the primary goals of the organization.


**5.  With reference to the impact of the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement resulted in the immediate and complete replacement of British-made goods with Indian-made alternatives across the country.
2. The establishment of national schools and colleges was a direct consequence of the movement's success in promoting indigenous education.
3. The movement's efforts to unite the Hindu and Muslim populations were largely successful in overcoming existing religious divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Swadeshi Movement significantly promoted the use of Indian-made goods and boycotted British products, it did not lead to the *complete* replacement of British goods. The movement's impact varied regionally, and British goods continued to be present in the market.  The statement overstates the extent of the movement's economic impact.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Swadeshi Movement's boycott of British educational institutions and the repression faced by nationalist-leaning educational institutions directly led to the founding of numerous national schools and colleges.  This was a significant cultural and educational outcome of the movement's efforts to promote indigenous education.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Swadeshi Movement, while aiming for national unity, did not fully overcome existing religious divisions.  The movement's emphasis on Hindu festivals and symbols alienated some Muslim populations, and the British government also exploited existing communal differences to weaken the movement. The statement ignores the communal tensions that existed and were exacerbated during the movement.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in 19th and 20th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha, established in 1851, primarily focused on reforming Parsi religious practices and modernizing social customs related to women's education and status.
2. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist efforts included advocating for women's rights, opposing polygamy and easy divorce, and promoting education among women, while simultaneously discouraging active participation in the national movement.
3. The Akali Movement, gaining momentum after 1920, primarily focused on purifying the management of gurudwaras and challenging corrupt mahants, leading to the enactment of the Sikh Gurudwaras Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of socio-religious reform movements in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha's role in Parsi reform, focusing on women's issues and the modernization of social customs.  This aligns with the broader trend of using reason and humanism to challenge orthodoxy within religious communities.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Sayyid Ahmad Khan's multifaceted approach. While he advocated for progressive social reforms concerning women, he also believed in a phased approach to political participation, advising Muslims to focus on education and modernization before engaging in direct political action against the British. This strategic decision, though well-intentioned, had unintended consequences in furthering communal divisions. Statement 3 correctly describes the Akali Movement's focus on gurudwara reform and its success in enacting legislation to address corrupt management practices.  This highlights the intersection of religious and political reform, a common theme in the era.  The Akali movement demonstrates a different approach to reform compared to Sayyid Ahmad Khan, opting for direct action and political engagement to achieve their goals. Therefore, all three statements are factually accurate and represent distinct yet interconnected strands of the wider reformist landscape.


**2. With reference to the historiography of modern India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nationalist approach to Indian history, primarily emerging after 1947, focused on the national movement as a unified struggle of the Indian people against colonial exploitation, often downplaying internal social contradictions.
2. The Marxist approach emphasized the primary contradiction between colonial masters and the subject people, but also acknowledged internal contradictions within Indian society, sometimes viewing the national movement as primarily a bourgeois phenomenon.
3. The Subaltern approach, emerging in the 1980s, critiqued existing historiography for its elitist bias, focusing on the experiences and voices of marginalized groups and challenging the notion of a unified national movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key characteristics of different historiographical approaches to modern India. Statement 1 correctly highlights the Nationalist approach's focus on presenting a unified national narrative, often emphasizing the shared struggle against colonial rule while sometimes minimizing internal divisions based on caste, religion, or class.  This approach served a crucial nation-building function in post-independence India. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Marxist approach's emphasis on class struggle as a central dynamic in Indian society. While acknowledging the primary contradiction between colonizers and colonized, it also analyzed internal class conflicts, sometimes characterizing the national movement as primarily driven by bourgeois interests. This perspective offers a critical lens to understanding the complexities of the freedom struggle. Statement 3 accurately captures the Subaltern approach's focus on marginalized voices and its critique of existing narratives as elitist. It challenged the idea of a homogenous national movement, highlighting the diverse experiences of subaltern groups and their often-conflicting interests with the nationalist elite. This approach broadened the scope of historical inquiry, enriching our understanding of the past. Therefore, the correct answer is (d), as all three statements offer valid descriptions of distinct historiographical approaches.



**3. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists, often termed Moderates, primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, such as petitions, meetings, and resolutions, believing in gradual and orderly political progress.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent Moderate leader, is known for his "drain of wealth" theory, highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule, and for his work in educating British public opinion about Indian grievances.
3. The early nationalist movement successfully secured most of its demands for reforms from the British government during this phase, demonstrating the effectiveness of their moderate approach.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key aspects of the early nationalist movement. Statement 1 correctly characterizes the Moderates' approach as primarily constitutional, focusing on legal and peaceful methods of political engagement.  They believed in gradual reforms through persuasion and reasoned argument rather than direct confrontation.  Statement 2 accurately highlights Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contributions. His "drain of wealth" theory provided a powerful economic critique of British rule, exposing its exploitative nature and highlighting the systematic transfer of resources from India to Britain. His efforts to educate British public opinion about Indian issues were also crucial in shaping the international discourse on Indian nationalism.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The early nationalist movement, despite its efforts, did not achieve most of its reform demands during this phase.  The British government's response was often limited and reluctant, showcasing the limitations of a purely constitutional approach in the face of entrenched colonial power. The limited success underscores the need for more assertive strategies that would emerge later in the movement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, concerning the post-World War I treatment of Turkey, provided a significant impetus for Hindu-Muslim unity and mass mobilization against British rule.
2. The Non-Cooperation movement encompassed a wide range of activities, including boycotts of government institutions, promotion of Swadeshi, and the establishment of national schools and colleges, but ultimately ended abruptly due to the Chauri Chaura incident.
3. The movement's success in achieving widespread participation across various social groups, including peasants, workers, and women, demonstrated the effectiveness of Gandhi's strategy of mass civil disobedience in challenging British authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Khilafat issue as a crucial catalyst for Hindu-Muslim unity and mass mobilization.  The shared concern over the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate and the perceived injustices against Turkey mobilized both communities against the British, temporarily transcending religious differences.  Statement 2 accurately describes the diverse range of activities within the Non-Cooperation movement, including boycotts, Swadeshi promotion, and the establishment of parallel educational institutions. The movement's abrupt end due to the Chauri Chaura incident, a tragic episode of violence, highlights the inherent challenges in maintaining non-violent discipline during mass mobilization. However, Statement 3 presents a somewhat oversimplified view of the movement's success. While the movement did witness significant participation from diverse groups, its impact was not uniformly successful across all sections of society.  Furthermore, the movement's ultimate failure to achieve its immediate goals suggests limitations in the strategy's effectiveness in directly challenging British rule.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is (a), as statements 1 and 2 provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of the movements.


**5. With reference to the debates within the Indian National Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first stage of the debate (1934-35) centered on the immediate strategy after the movement's suspension, with perspectives ranging from Gandhian constructive work to constitutional struggle and participation in elections.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend, opposed both constructive work and council entry, advocating for the resumption of mass struggle, emphasizing the need for incorporating class struggle into the anti-imperialist movement.
3. The second stage debate (1937), concerning office acceptance in provincial elections under the Government of India Act 1935, saw a sharp division between those favoring office acceptance as a tactical move and those opposing it as a compromise with imperialism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the key debates within the Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies the initial phase of debate (1934-35) focusing on the immediate course of action. The differing viewpoints highlight the internal ideological diversity within the Congress, ranging from Gandhi's emphasis on constructive programs to the more politically active approaches advocated by others. Statement 2 accurately portrays Nehru's leftist perspective, his critique of solely focusing on constructive work or electoral politics, and his emphasis on the importance of class struggle within the broader anti-imperialist struggle.  This reflects his socialist leanings and his vision for a more radical approach to achieving independence.  Statement 3 accurately describes the second stage debate (1937) surrounding office acceptance in the provincial elections. This debate highlighted the strategic differences between those who saw office acceptance as a tactical opportunity to influence governance and those who viewed it as a potential compromise with the colonial system. The divergence of views underscores the complex strategic considerations faced by the Congress leadership. Therefore, all three statements accurately capture the crucial internal discussions within the Congress, making (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the factors contributing to the growth of communalism in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic backwardness of the country, leading to intense competition for limited job opportunities, fueled communal tensions and appeals to sectarian interests for securing employment.
2. The manner in which Indian history was taught in schools and colleges, often portraying the medieval period as solely a "Muslim period," contributed to the growth of communalist feelings among both Hindus and Muslims.
3. The British policy of "divide and rule" actively encouraged communal divisions by supporting pro-British individuals and organizations, thus exacerbating existing tensions between religious communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements identify significant factors contributing to the rise of communalism in British India. Statement 1 correctly points to the link between economic backwardness and communal tensions. The scarcity of jobs and opportunities intensified competition between different communities, leading to appeals based on religious identity to secure a share of limited resources. This highlights the socio-economic dimensions of communalism. Statement 2 accurately describes the role of biased historical narratives in shaping communal perceptions. The portrayal of the medieval period as exclusively "Muslim" ignored the complex realities of co-existence and interaction between different communities, fostering a simplistic and divisive understanding of history. This manipulation of historical narratives served to deepen communal divides. Statement 3 correctly identifies the British policy of "divide and rule" as a deliberate strategy to maintain control. By supporting pro-British elements within different communities and exploiting existing religious differences, the British exacerbated communal tensions, thus hindering the growth of a unified national identity. This underscores the political dimension of communalism.  Therefore, all three statements offer valid insights into the complex factors that contributed to communalism in British India, making (d) the correct answer.


**7.  With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, but this federation never materialized due to the non-fulfillment of certain conditions.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, granting provinces significant administrative and financial powers, but the Governor still retained substantial powers, including special responsibilities concerning minorities and law and order.
3. The Act extended the system of communal electorates, further promoting separatist tendencies and contributing to the eventual partition of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features and consequences of the Government of India Act 1935. Statement 1 correctly notes the Act's attempt to establish an All-India Federation, a significant constitutional reform. However, it accurately points out that this federation never came into being due to the failure of the princely states to meet the conditions for joining the federation. This highlights the limitations of the Act in achieving its stated aim of a unified Indian federation. Statement 2 correctly describes the introduction of provincial autonomy, a major shift from the earlier dyarchical system. While granting provinces more self-governance, it accurately emphasizes that the Governor retained significant powers, acting as a check on provincial autonomy, especially concerning minority rights and law and order. This balance of power reflected the British government's reluctance to relinquish complete control. Statement 3 correctly highlights the Act's extension of communal electorates, a deeply problematic aspect of the Act. This provision further entrenched religious divisions, exacerbating communal tensions and ultimately contributing to the partition of India. The continuation of separate electorates demonstrated a failure to address the fundamental issue of communal harmony. Therefore, all three statements are accurate reflections of the Act's provisions and its consequences.  The correct answer is (d).


**8.  With reference to the responses to the Cripps Mission (1942), consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress rejected the Cripps proposals primarily due to the offer of dominion status instead of complete independence, the right of provinces to secede, and the lack of immediate transfer of power.
2. The Muslim League criticized the proposals because they did not explicitly offer the creation of Pakistan and because of objections to the machinery for creating a constituent assembly.
3. The Cripps Mission failed because of the British government's lack of seriousness in transferring power and their unwillingness to compromise on key issues, such as the Governor-General's veto.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the reasons for the failure of the Cripps Mission. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Congress's key objections to the Cripps proposals. The offer of dominion status, rather than complete independence, was a major point of contention. The right of provinces to secede was seen as undermining national unity, and the lack of immediate transfer of power was unacceptable to the Congress.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the Muslim League's concerns.  The absence of an explicit commitment to the creation of Pakistan was a major stumbling block, and the League also had reservations about the proposed structure and process for forming a constituent assembly.  Statement 3 correctly points to the lack of seriousness on the part of the British government as a major factor in the mission's failure. The British government's unwillingness to compromise on key issues, such as the Governor-General's veto, and its lack of genuine intent to transfer power undermined the negotiations.  The inherent contradictions and ambiguities within the proposals, combined with the British government's lack of commitment, doomed the mission from the outset.  Therefore, all three statements accurately capture the reasons for the failure of the Cripps Mission, making (d) the correct option.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905):**

1.  The first session of the Indian National Congress was attended by 72 delegates and presided over by Dadabhai Naoroji.
2.  The Indian National Congress, from its inception, advocated for immediate and complete independence (Purna Swaraj).
3.  The early Congress leaders primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation, petitions, and public opinion building to achieve their goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the first session was indeed attended by 72 delegates, it was presided over by Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, not Dadabhai Naoroji.  Dadabhai Naoroji served as president of the Congress on three separate occasions later in its early years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The early phase of the Congress (1885-1905), often referred to as the "Moderate Phase," focused on constitutional methods and gradual reforms within the existing British framework.  The demand for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) emerged later in the movement's history.

Statement 3 is correct.  The early nationalists, known as Moderates, believed in working within the system to achieve gradual reforms.  Their approach primarily involved constitutional agitation, submitting petitions to the government, and building public opinion both in India and in Britain to pressure the authorities for change.  They avoided direct confrontation and advocated for a peaceful and gradual approach to self-governance.  This strategy reflects their faith in the British system's capacity for reform and their desire to avoid provoking excessive hostility from the colonial government.


**2. With reference to the economic critique of British imperialism by early Indian nationalists (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" argued that British policies led to a systematic transfer of wealth from India to Britain.
2.  The early nationalists primarily advocated for the immediate nationalization of all British-owned industries in India.
3.  The Swadeshi movement promoted the boycott of British goods and the use of Indian-made products to boost the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" was a crucial element of the early nationalist economic critique.  He meticulously documented how British policies resulted in a significant outflow of India's wealth to Britain, contributing to India's poverty and economic backwardness. This theory highlighted the exploitative nature of British rule and became a central argument for demanding economic reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the early nationalists criticized British economic policies and advocated for the development of Indian industries, they did not call for the immediate nationalization of all British-owned industries. Their approach was more gradual, focusing on promoting Indian industries through measures like tariff protection and government support.  Nationalization became a more prominent demand in later phases of the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a key aspect of the early nationalist economic strategy, actively promoted the use of Indian-made goods and the boycott of British products. This was seen as a crucial step in reviving the Indian economy, reducing dependence on Britain, and fostering national self-reliance.  The burning of foreign cloth was a symbolic act of this movement.


**3. With reference to the aims and objectives of the Indian National Congress during its moderate phase (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress aimed to establish a completely independent Indian state immediately upon its formation.
2.  The Congress sought to foster a sense of national unity among Indians, transcending religious, caste, and regional differences.
3.  The Congress primarily focused on achieving its objectives through armed rebellion and violent confrontation with the British authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early Congress did not advocate for immediate independence.  Its initial goals were more moderate, focusing on gradual reforms within the existing British system.  The demand for complete independence emerged later in the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of the early Congress was to foster a sense of national unity among Indians from diverse backgrounds.  This was crucial in creating a unified front against British rule and promoting a shared Indian identity that transcended religious, caste, and regional divides.  The Congress aimed to bring together various segments of Indian society under a common political banner.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The moderate phase of the Congress was characterized by its commitment to non-violent and constitutional methods of political action.  The Congress leaders of this period believed in achieving their objectives through peaceful means, such as petitions, public opinion campaigns, and constitutional agitation within the existing political framework.  The use of armed rebellion was not part of their strategy.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Indian Councils Act of 1892:**

1.  The Act significantly increased the number of elected Indian representatives in the legislative councils.
2.  The Act granted the legislative councils the power to vote on the annual budget.
3. The Act significantly expanded the powers of the legislative councils, granting them near-total control over Indian governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act did increase the number of members in both the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils, the increase in Indian representation was limited and indirect.  Officials still held a clear majority, limiting the influence of elected Indian members.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allowed for the discussion of the annual budget in the councils, but it did not grant the councils the power to vote on it.  The power to approve the budget remained firmly in the hands of the British government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act made only minor changes to the powers of the legislative councils.  The councils remained largely advisory bodies with limited power over governance.  The British government retained significant control over all major policy decisions. The Act was widely criticized by Indian nationalists for its inadequacies and for failing to meet their demands for greater representation and power.  The limited nature of the reforms reflects the British government's reluctance to significantly share power.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist leaders of India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji was the first Indian to be elected as the President of the Indian National Congress.
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent leader of the early Congress and a staunch advocate of complete independence.
3.  Surendranath Banerjea was a prominent leader of the Indian Association and played a crucial role in the early nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji served as President of the Indian National Congress three times, he was not the first.  Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee was the first president of the Indian National Congress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent leader of the early Congress, but he was not a staunch advocate of complete independence in the early years. He believed in working within the existing system to achieve gradual reforms.  His advocacy for complete independence came later in the movement.

Statement 3 is correct. Surendranath Banerjea was a leading figure in the Indian Association, a significant precursor to the Indian National Congress. He was a powerful orator and played a vital role in shaping the early nationalist movement, particularly in Bengal.  His advocacy for reforms and his contributions to the development of nationalist sentiment are well documented.  The Indian Association played a significant role in raising public awareness of political issues and mobilizing support for nationalist demands.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on various aspects of British policies in India, demanding factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially aimed to modernize India progressively but later adopted reactionary policies, citing Indian unsuitability for self-governance.
2. The "divide and rule" policy primarily involved pitting Hindus against Muslims, neglecting other societal divisions.
3. The British consistently opposed all forms of modern education in India, viewing it as a threat to their authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The British initially envisioned a progressive modernization of India, but post-1857, they shifted to reactionary policies, arguing that Indians lacked the capacity for self-rule.  This shift is a crucial aspect of understanding the colonial mindset and its impact on Indian society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British exploited Hindu-Muslim tensions, their "divide and rule" policy was far more multifaceted.  They manipulated differences between princes and subjects, regions, provinces, castes, and various other social groups to maintain their control.  Oversimplifying the policy to just Hindu-Muslim conflict is a significant distortion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British attitude toward education was complex. While they initially promoted Western education to a limited extent, their response to the growing nationalist movement, which often stemmed from educated Indians, became increasingly hostile.  They did not uniformly oppose *all* forms of modern education but selectively suppressed those perceived as fostering nationalism.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted zamindars complete ownership rights over their lands, with no limitations.
2. The Ryotwari system, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly taxed the cultivators, resulting in higher revenue for the British but severe hardship for the peasants.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities, ensuring equitable distribution of tax burden.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement granted zamindars significant proprietary rights, it wasn't absolute.  The "sunset clause" allowed the government to reclaim land if taxes remained unpaid.  This created vulnerabilities for zamindars and ultimately contributed to the growth of absentee landlordism.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ryotwari system did directly tax cultivators, bypassing intermediaries. This maximized revenue for the British but often resulted in overassessment and immense hardship for the peasantry, leading to widespread poverty and indebtedness.  Understanding the economic impact of this system is vital in analyzing rural India's trajectory under colonial rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Mahalwari system, while collecting revenue from village communities, didn't always ensure equitable distribution.  Inaccurate assessments, corruption, and the village headman's role often led to uneven tax burdens and exploitation of individual cultivators.  The system's inherent complexities and potential for abuse are crucial points for analysis.


**3. With reference to the British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Post-1813, the British actively promoted social reforms aligned with Western liberal ideals, leading to significant changes in Indian society.
2. The British consistently supported Christian missionaries in their efforts to convert Indians, viewing it as a crucial aspect of modernization.
3. The British policy towards princely states involved both utilizing them as a buffer against unrest and simultaneously undermining their autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some British officials advocated social reforms, the overall British policy was inconsistent.  After the 1857 revolt, they became more cautious, often aligning with conservative elements in Indian society to maintain stability and control, rather than actively promoting sweeping social change.  The complexities of this ambivalent approach are crucial to understanding the colonial impact on Indian society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British tolerated Christian missionary activities, their support wasn't consistent or unconditional.  Their primary concern was maintaining political control, and their support for missionaries was often pragmatic, recognizing the potential for missionaries to act as agents of social change (that could both help and hinder British interests).

Statement 3 is correct.  The British policy toward princely states was a classic example of "divide and rule." They used the princes as a counterweight against nationalist movements, yet simultaneously asserted paramountcy, gradually reducing the princes' autonomy and control over their states.  This dual approach is a key element in understanding the British strategy for maintaining power in India.


**4. With reference to British economic policies and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The British actively promoted the development of modern industries in India to create a balanced economy.
2. The British imposed high taxes, particularly land revenue, leading to widespread rural indebtedness and poverty.
3. The British consistently protected Indian industries from foreign competition through protective tariffs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British primarily focused on extracting resources and transforming India into a market for British manufactured goods. While some industrial development occurred, it was largely geared toward serving British interests, not fostering a balanced Indian economy.  This exploitative aspect of British economic policy is central to understanding India's economic underdevelopment during the colonial period.

Statement 2 is correct.  British revenue policies, particularly the high land revenue demands under various systems like Ryotwari and Mahalwari, severely burdened Indian peasants, driving many into debt and poverty. This is a key factor in explaining the widespread rural distress during British rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British did not protect Indian industries; instead, they actively dismantled existing industries through policies that favored British manufacturers.  The lack of protective tariffs and the deliberate suppression of Indian industries are crucial aspects of the colonial economic system.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding British foreign policy in India:**

1. The British expansion beyond India's natural frontiers was solely driven by the need for national defense.
2.  British foreign policy in Asia and Africa aimed to protect the Indian empire and expand British commercial interests.
3.  Conflicts with other European powers were primarily caused by disputes over trade routes within India itself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While strategic considerations played a role, British expansion was driven by a complex interplay of factors, including the desire to secure resources, expand commercial interests, and outmaneuver rival European powers.  The motivations were far more multifaceted than simply national defense.

Statement 2 is correct.  Protecting the valuable Indian empire and expanding British commercial and economic interests were indeed central goals of British foreign policy in Asia and Africa. This is a critical aspect of understanding the broader context of British imperialism.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Conflicts with other European powers stemmed from broader geopolitical competition for influence and territories in Asia and Africa, not solely from trade route disputes within India.  The clash of imperial ambitions on a global scale is crucial to understanding the dynamics of British foreign policy.


These MCQs illustrate the complexity of British rule in India, demanding detailed knowledge and analytical skills, aligning with the requirements of a challenging UPSC exam.  The distractors are designed to test candidates' understanding of nuances and potential misconceptions surrounding these historical topics.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on Polity and Governance, based on the themes present in the provided text, but not directly reproducing the information.  The questions aim for a higher difficulty level by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring nuanced understanding.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905):**

1.  The Moderates primarily employed constitutional agitation, focusing on petitions and public appeals to influence British policy.
2.  Economic reforms advocated by early nationalists included tariff protection for Indian industries and a reduction in the drain of wealth to Britain.
3.  The Ilbert Bill controversy highlighted the issue of racial discrimination within the Indian judicial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the early nationalist movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the constitutional and relatively moderate approach of early nationalists, who prioritized working within the existing legal framework to achieve gradual reforms.  They believed that sustained pressure through petitions and public discourse could persuade the British government to concede their demands.  Statement 2 is accurate in highlighting the economic concerns of early nationalists, who recognized the detrimental effects of British economic policies on India.  Their proposals for tariff protection aimed to foster the growth of Indian industries and reduce India's economic dependence on Britain. The "drain of wealth" was a central theme in their critique of British rule. Statement 3 correctly points to the Ilbert Bill controversy, a significant event that exposed the deep-seated racial biases in the British Indian administration.  The bill, which aimed at allowing Indian judges to try European offenders, faced strong opposition from the British community in India, revealing the extent of racial discrimination in the judicial system.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress, from its inception, explicitly advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj).
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 significantly increased Indian representation and power in the legislative councils, satisfying nationalist demands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's seminal work on the "drain of wealth" was a crucial contribution to the nationalist discourse, exposing the systematic economic exploitation of India under British rule. This theory highlighted how British policies systematically transferred India's resources to Britain, contributing to India's impoverishment.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the early Congress initially focused on securing greater Indian participation in the existing governance structure, not immediate complete independence.  The demand for Purna Swaraj emerged later. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils, it fell far short of satisfying nationalist aspirations.  Indian representation remained limited, and the councils lacked substantial power. The act was widely criticized by nationalists as insufficient.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established a fully autonomous federal government in India, granting complete self-rule.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy.
3.  The Act's provisions for communal electorates exacerbated existing religious tensions and contributed to the partition of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The Government of India Act of 1935 did indeed introduce provincial autonomy, granting greater self-governance to the provinces. This replaced the earlier dyarchical system, which had divided executive power between British officials and elected Indian ministers. However, the Act fell short of establishing full autonomy at the federal level.  Statement 3 is also correct; the Act's provisions for separate electorates, based on religious communities, further entrenched communal divisions.  This contributed significantly to the escalating tensions between Hindus and Muslims, ultimately culminating in the partition of India.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act did not grant complete self-rule.  Significant powers remained vested in the British governor-general and governors, and the federal structure remained largely under British control.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the responses to the Cripps Mission in 1942:**

1.  The Congress fully endorsed the Cripps Mission proposals, accepting the offer of dominion status.
2.  The Muslim League rejected the Cripps proposals, primarily due to the absence of a clear provision for Pakistan.
3.  The Cripps Mission's failure stemmed partly from the British government's unwillingness to immediately transfer substantial power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The Muslim League, under Jinnah's leadership, decisively rejected the Cripps proposals because they did not explicitly address the demand for a separate Muslim state (Pakistan).  The League viewed the plan for a united Indian Union as inadequate to protect Muslim interests. Statement 3 is also correct; a major reason for the Cripps Mission's failure was the British government's reluctance to cede substantial power immediately.  While the mission offered a plan for a constituent assembly to frame a future constitution, it retained significant control over key areas like defence and retained the Governor-General's substantial powers.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Congress rejected the Cripps proposals, primarily due to its offer of dominion status rather than complete independence, the ambiguous nature of the plan for a constituent assembly, and the right of provinces to secede.  The Congress found the proposals insufficient to address India's demands for self-determination.



**5. With reference to the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for a socialist economic system for independent India, although they differed on the means of achieving it.
2.  Gandhi vehemently opposed any form of violence in the struggle for independence, while Bose believed that armed struggle might be necessary.
3.  Gandhi envisioned a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose favoured rapid industrialization and a more centralized model.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the key differences in the ideologies of Gandhi and Bose.  Statement 1 is correct; although both leaders expressed support for socialist principles in post-independence India, their approaches differed significantly.  Gandhi's vision was rooted in his philosophy of Sarvodaya (upliftment of all), emphasizing self-sufficiency and decentralized village economies. Bose, influenced by modern socialist thought, advocated for rapid industrialization and state-led economic planning to address India's poverty and unemployment. Statement 2 correctly highlights their contrasting views on the method of struggle. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and satyagraha formed the cornerstone of his political philosophy.  Bose, while respecting Gandhi's philosophy, believed that armed struggle might be necessary to achieve independence, especially in the context of the Second World War. Statement 3 correctly contrasts their economic visions. Gandhi's vision centered on a decentralized, village-based economy emphasizing self-reliance, cottage industries, and simple living. Bose, on the other hand, advocated for rapid industrialization, believing it essential for India's economic progress and ability to compete on the global stage.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate representations of their differing ideologies.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to Gandhi's philosophy and early activism, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's philosophy emphasized a strict separation between belief and action, prioritizing theoretical understanding over practical application.
2. The Champaran Satyagraha marked Gandhi's first major experiment with Satyagraha in India, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers.
3. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike saw Gandhi employ a fast-unto-death to mediate a labor dispute, achieving a wage increase for the workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's philosophy strongly emphasized the inseparability of thought and practice, believing that truth and non-violence should be integral to daily life, not just rhetoric.  His actions consistently reflected this principle.

Statement 2 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha in 1917 was indeed Gandhi's first significant Satyagraha campaign in India, successfully addressing the oppression of indigo farmers by European planters.  This event showcased his approach to non-violent civil disobedience and his ability to mobilize the peasantry.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike of 1918 saw Gandhi utilize a fast-unto-death as a powerful tool for negotiation and compromise, ultimately securing a wage increase for the striking mill workers. This demonstrated the effectiveness of Satyagraha in labor disputes and his commitment to the welfare of the working class.  The fast was a strategic move, highlighting his commitment to the cause and influencing the mill owners.


**2. With reference to the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1918, aimed to curb revolutionary activities by granting the government expanded powers of arrest and detention without trial.
2. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre occurred in response to a peaceful protest against the Rowlatt Act, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties.
3.  The Hunter Committee, established to investigate the Jallianwala Bagh incident, fully exonerated General Dyer, citing his actions as necessary to maintain order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the year is slightly off. The Rowlatt Act, passed in *1919*,  did grant the government extensive powers to arrest and detain individuals without trial, effectively undermining basic civil liberties. This was seen as a highly repressive measure by Indian nationalists.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in Amritsar in April 1919, in response to a protest against the Rowlatt Act.  Although initially peaceful, the protest was met with brutal force by General Dyer, leading to a significant loss of civilian life. This event galvanized Indian nationalism and intensified the anti-British sentiment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Hunter Committee, while acknowledging some justification for the use of force, overwhelmingly condemned General Dyer’s actions at Jallianwala Bagh as excessive and unjustified.  The committee's report highlighted the lack of warning and the disproportionate use of lethal force against a largely unarmed crowd.  While Dyer was not criminally prosecuted due to an Indemnity Act, his career was effectively ended.


**3. With reference to the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms and the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced responsible government at both the provincial and central levels, granting Indians significant control over administration.
2. Dyarchy, a system of dual governance, was implemented in the provinces, dividing administrative subjects between the Governor and elected ministers.
3. The reforms significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantial majority of the Indian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms did *not* introduce responsible government at the central level.  While some power was devolved to elected ministers in the provinces (dyarchy), the Governor-General and the Viceroy retained ultimate authority.  Real self-governance remained a distant goal.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dyarchy was a key feature of the reforms at the provincial level.  Administrative subjects were divided into "reserved" (under the Governor's control) and "transferred" (under elected ministers), creating a system of dual executive authority. This system proved to be inherently flawed and often led to conflict.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the franchise was expanded under the reforms, it still remained extremely limited.  The electorate comprised only a small fraction of the Indian population, excluding vast segments of the society from political participation.  The reforms were criticized for their limited scope and failure to genuinely empower the Indian people.


**4. With reference to Gandhi's activities in South Africa and his return to India, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's initial approach to addressing the grievances of Indians in South Africa involved primarily violent protests and direct confrontation with authorities.
2.  Upon returning to India in 1915, Gandhi immediately launched large-scale nationwide campaigns for complete independence.
3. Gandhi's experiences in South Africa significantly shaped his development of Satyagraha, a philosophy and method of non-violent resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's initial efforts in South Africa involved petitions and appeals to the authorities.  It was only after the failure of these moderate approaches that he adopted Satyagraha as a method of non-violent resistance.  His early strategy was constitutional and peaceful.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  After his return to India in 1915, Gandhi initially focused on understanding Indian conditions before launching large-scale political campaigns. He engaged in local struggles (Champaran, Ahmedabad, Kheda) to refine his Satyagraha approach and build a mass base before embarking on broader movements for independence.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's experiences with racial discrimination and oppression in South Africa were instrumental in the evolution of his philosophy of Satyagraha. The South African context provided the crucible for refining the principles and methods of non-violent resistance which he later applied in India.  His South African experiences fundamentally shaped his political thought and activism.


**5. With reference to the growth of militant nationalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of militant nationalism was solely driven by the influence of Western revolutionary ideologies and had no connection with indigenous factors.
2.  The partition of Bengal in 1905, intended by the British to divide and weaken the nationalist movement, instead sparked widespread opposition and fueled militant nationalist sentiment.
3.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on economic boycotts and did not involve any form of political activism or challenge to British authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Western ideas and the examples of other nationalist movements abroad played a role, the rise of militant nationalism in India was also deeply rooted in indigenous factors such as disillusionment with moderate politics, growing awareness of British exploitation, and a resurgence of Indian cultural pride and self-confidence.  It was a complex interplay of internal and external influences.

Statement 2 is correct. The partition of Bengal, a clear attempt by the British to divide and weaken Bengali nationalism, had the opposite effect. It ignited widespread protests and significantly contributed to the growth of militant nationalism across India, marking a turning point in the national movement.  The partition served as a catalyst for broader anti-colonial resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swadeshi movement, though initially focused on economic self-reliance and boycotting British goods, was inextricably linked to broader political goals.  It involved active political participation, mass mobilization, and a direct challenge to British authority.  It was a potent blend of economic and political activism.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian Polity and Governance during the formative years of the Indian National Congress and the early nationalist movement.


**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress's initial demands focused on immediate and radical changes to British rule, including complete independence.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his "Drain of Wealth" theory, argued that British rule was systematically impoverishing India.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils, still maintained an official majority, leaving nationalists dissatisfied.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early nationalists, categorized as "Moderates," adopted a gradualist approach, focusing on incremental reforms within the existing British framework.  Their initial demands centered on expanding and reforming the Legislative Councils to gain a greater voice in governance, not on immediate independence.  The demand for Swaraj (self-rule) emerged later.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory was a pivotal contribution to the early nationalist movement's economic critique of British rule.  He meticulously documented how British policies led to the systematic transfer of India's wealth to Britain, contributing significantly to India's poverty.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did indeed increase the number of members in both the Imperial and Provincial Legislative Councils, and allowed for some indirect election of Indian members. However, the British retained a clear majority, effectively limiting the influence of Indian representatives and fueling nationalist dissatisfaction. The act fell far short of the nationalists' aspirations for substantial Indian control over governance.  This limited success further solidified the belief that more assertive strategies were needed.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalists and their methods, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderates primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation, petitions, and public appeals to achieve their goals.
2.  The Extremists, unlike the Moderates, advocated for complete independence from British rule from the very beginning of the movement.
3.  The early nationalists unanimously opposed the partition of Bengal in 1905, showcasing a united front against British policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Moderates, such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, primarily focused on constitutional means like petitions, public appeals, and working within the existing legislative framework to achieve their political and economic goals. They believed in gradual progress through persuasion and reasoned argument.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Extremists, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal, were certainly more radical in their approach and advocated for greater self-rule eventually,  they did not initially call for complete independence from the outset. Their methods included swadeshi (boycott of British goods) and passive resistance, but the outright demand for complete independence came later in the movement's trajectory.

Statement 3 is correct.  The partition of Bengal in 1905 united various factions within the nationalist movement, including both Moderates and Extremists, in opposition. The partition became a powerful symbol of British oppression and fueled widespread protests and mobilization across India, temporarily setting aside some internal differences within the Congress.



**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935 and the Congress response, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, which immediately included all princely states.
2. The Congress unconditionally accepted the Act's provisions for provincial autonomy.
3.  The Act introduced a system of separate electorates, furthering communal divisions in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 envisioned an All-India Federation but its formation was contingent upon the accession of a significant number of princely states, which ultimately did not happen. The Act's federal structure remained incomplete because of the non-participation of many princely states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Congress vehemently opposed the Government of India Act of 1935, viewing it as another attempt to consolidate British control.  While the Congress did contest elections under the Act and subsequently formed ministries in several provinces, this was a strategic decision based on the political context of the time, and not an endorsement of the Act's overall framework.  The Congress continued to demand complete independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 perpetuated and even extended the system of separate electorates introduced earlier, particularly for Muslims and other minority communities.  This provision enshrined communal divisions in the political structure and ultimately contributed to the partition of India.  The separate electorates exacerbated communal tensions, making it more difficult to forge a united national identity.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22):**

1. The movement's initial success was partly fueled by the Khilafat agitation, which united Hindus and Muslims against British rule.
2.  The movement's abrupt end was primarily due to Gandhi's belief that the movement's participants had not adequately mastered the principles of non-violence.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, had no significant impact on the course of the movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement gained considerable momentum due to the convergence of nationalist aspirations with the Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliph.  This created a powerful sense of shared grievance among both Hindus and Muslims, leading to widespread participation in the movement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors attacked a police station, deeply troubled Gandhi. He believed that the widespread violence demonstrated an insufficient understanding and commitment to non-violence among the participants. This led him to suspend the mass civil disobedience campaign, signaling a significant turning point in the movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chauri Chaura incident was a pivotal factor in Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. The violence directly contradicted his principle of non-violence, leading him to believe that the movement had become uncontrollable and risked being brutally suppressed by the British. The incident is significant because it demonstrates the tension between the ideal of non-violent resistance and the realities of mass mobilization.


**5. With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the Congress's formation.
2. The first session of the Indian National Congress was attended by thousands of delegates.
3. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose were prominent figures in the early Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, is widely recognized for his instrumental role in establishing the Indian National Congress. He played a key organizational role and helped bring together various Indian leaders to form the Congress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first session of the Indian National Congress, held in Bombay in 1885, was attended by a significantly smaller number of delegates (72), not thousands.  The Congress's membership and participation grew considerably over subsequent years.

Statement 3 is correct. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose were indeed prominent early leaders of the Congress.  They were influential figures in the nationalist movement, contributing significantly to its development during its formative years.  While they were involved with the Indian National Conference which preceded the Congress, they were also actively involved in the early years of the Congress.

Some questions might necessitate deeper knowledge beyond the provided text, reflecting the demanding nature of UPSC examinations.


**1. With reference to the early Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress initially focused solely on demanding complete independence from British rule.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale were prominent leaders of the moderate faction.
3.  The Congress's early methods primarily involved constitutional agitation and appeals to British authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early Congress, characterized by the "moderate" phase, did not initially advocate for complete independence.  Their primary focus was on gradual constitutional reforms within the existing British framework.  The demand for "Swaraj" (self-rule) evolved later.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale were indeed leading figures within the moderate faction of the Congress during its early years. They championed gradual reforms and constitutional methods.

Statement 3 is correct. The moderate Congress primarily employed constitutional methods such as petitions, resolutions, and participation in legislative councils to press for reforms.  They largely avoided direct confrontation or extra-constitutional means.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was entirely unrelated to Indian political aspirations and served only as a religious cause.
2.  The movement involved a complete boycott of British institutions, including schools, colleges, and courts, and the promotion of 'swadeshi' (Indian-made goods).
3. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash occurred between protesters and police, led to the movement's suspension by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khilafat issue stemmed from concerns about the Ottoman Empire, it became intertwined with Indian nationalism.  It provided a powerful unifying factor, bringing together Hindus and Muslims in a common cause against British rule.  It was a potent symbol of anti-imperialism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement involved a wide-ranging boycott of British institutions and a strong emphasis on 'swadeshi,' aiming to cripple the British economic presence in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence and the burning of a police station, deeply disturbed Gandhi, who believed in non-violent resistance.  This incident prompted him to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**3. With reference to the Congress's response to World War II, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress unconditionally supported Britain's war effort due to its opposition to fascism.
2.  The Cripps Mission, sent to India to negotiate cooperation, offered dominion status as the ultimate goal for India but failed to secure Congress support.
3. The Congress ministries in the provinces resigned in protest against Britain's decision to involve India in the war without consultation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gandhi personally had sympathy for the Allied cause due to his opposition to fascism, the Congress as a whole did *not* offer unconditional support.  They made it contingent upon the grant of substantial self-government for India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cripps Mission did offer dominion status, a step short of complete independence, which was unacceptable to many Congress leaders.  The mission's failure stemmed from several key disagreements, including the right of provinces to secede and the lack of immediate power transfer.

Statement 3 is correct. The Congress ministries in several provinces did resign to protest Britain's unilateral decision to involve India in the war without consulting Indian leaders or granting any meaningful concessions on self-rule.  This resignation marked a significant turning point in the relationship between the Congress and the British government.



**4.  With reference to the differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Gandhi and Bose unequivocally rejected socialism as a viable path for India's development.
2.  Gandhi strongly advocated for non-violent resistance (Satyagraha), while Bose believed that armed struggle was necessary to achieve independence.
3. Both leaders shared a deep respect for each other despite their differing approaches and ideologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both were wary of communism, neither unequivocally rejected socialism. Gandhi favoured a unique form of decentralized socialism focused on village self-sufficiency, while Bose, while initially leaning towards a synthesis of socialism and fascism (later clarifying his support for socialism after independence), ultimately favored a socialist reconstruction of India post-independence.

Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi's philosophy centered on non-violent resistance (Satyagraha), while Bose, particularly in his later years, believed that armed struggle was a necessary component of India's fight for independence.  This difference in approach led to significant disagreements within the Congress.

Statement 3 is correct. Despite their ideological differences and eventual parting of ways, both Gandhi and Bose held a deep respect for each other and acknowledged the other's significant contributions to the Indian freedom struggle.  Their personal relationship, while strained at times, remained marked by mutual respect.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Ilbert Bill controversy primarily concerned restrictions on the freedom of the press.
2. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 significantly increased Indian representation and power in the legislative councils, satisfying nationalist demands.
3.  The "drain of wealth" theory, articulated by Dadabhai Naoroji, highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ilbert Bill controversy was centered on the jurisdiction of European judges over Indian officials, not primarily on press freedom.  While press freedom was a concern for nationalists, it wasn't the central issue in this specific event.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did increase the number of Indian members in legislative councils, but it fell far short of satisfying nationalist demands for substantial representation and power.  The British retained a clear majority, limiting the impact of Indian participation.

Statement 3 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory was a crucial contribution to the early nationalist movement, exposing the economic exploitation of India under British rule and highlighting the transfer of resources from India to Britain.  This theory provided a powerful economic argument for self-rule.


**6. With reference to the impact of the Partition of Bengal (1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was universally welcomed by all sections of Indian society due to its administrative benefits.
2.  The Swadeshi movement, launched in protest against the partition, involved the boycott of British goods and the promotion of Indian industries.
3. The partition ultimately strengthened the unity of the Indian National Congress, preventing any internal divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The partition of Bengal was deeply unpopular and met with widespread protests across India. It was seen as a divisive tactic by the British, aimed at weakening the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a major response to the partition, involved a concerted effort to boycott British goods and promote the use of Indian-made products, contributing to the growth of Indian industries and a sense of national unity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Partition actually exacerbated existing divisions within the Congress, leading to a split between the moderate and extremist factions at the Surat session in 1907.  The partition highlighted the challenges in maintaining unity within the movement.


**7. With reference to the Rowlatt Act (1919), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allowed for the detention of individuals without trial for up to two years.
2. The Act was widely popular among Indians due to its perceived effectiveness in maintaining law and order.
3. Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement as a direct response to the Act's passage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act was indeed controversial for its provision allowing for the detention of individuals without trial, a significant infringement on civil liberties. This was a major factor contributing to widespread protests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rowlatt Act was highly unpopular among Indians, sparking widespread protests and demonstrations.  It was perceived as an authoritarian and repressive measure, undermining civil liberties.

Statement 3 is correct, although the Non-Cooperation Movement was broader than just a response to the Rowlatt Act.  The Act's passage, however, was a significant catalyst for the movement, demonstrating the growing discontent with British rule and the willingness of Indians to engage in civil disobedience.


**8. With reference to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919), consider the following statements:**

1. The massacre took place in a densely populated open space with limited exits.
2.  The event led to widespread condemnation within India but was largely supported by the British public.
3. Rabindranath Tagore, in response to the massacre, renounced his knighthood awarded by the British government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Jallianwala Bagh was a confined space with limited exits, making it difficult for the large crowd to escape the indiscriminate firing by General Dyer's troops. This significantly increased the death toll and severity of the event.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some segments of the British public might have initially shown support for Dyer's actions, the massacre was widely condemned within India and by many in Britain as well, highlighting the brutality of the event and the growing discontent with British rule.

Statement 3 is correct. Rabindranath Tagore, a prominent Indian intellectual and poet, did renounce his knighthood in protest against the massacre, demonstrating the widespread outrage and condemnation of the event across India.


**9. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent Indian federation with complete control over its internal affairs.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting increased powers to provincial legislatures.
3. The Act's federal provisions, including the inclusion of princely states, were fully implemented immediately.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did not establish a fully independent federation.  It retained significant British control over key areas such as defense and foreign affairs, limiting India's autonomy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did introduce a system of provincial autonomy, granting more power to provincial legislatures and establishing ministers responsible to those legislatures.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The federal provisions of the Act, including the incorporation of princely states, were never fully implemented. The outbreak of World War II and other political developments prevented the establishment of the envisioned all-India federation.


**10. With reference to the Dandi March (1930), consider the following statements:**

1. The march was led by Mahatma Gandhi to protest against the salt tax imposed by the British government.
2. The march was primarily a symbolic act of defiance against British authority and laws.
3. The march was immediately followed by the complete and unconditional transfer of power to India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dandi March was indeed initiated by Mahatma Gandhi to protest against the British government's salt tax, which was a significant burden on the Indian population.

Statement 2 is correct. The march was primarily symbolic, highlighting the injustice of British laws and the Indian people's determination to resist them through non-violent means.  It was a powerful demonstration of civil disobedience.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Dandi March, while a significant event, did not immediately lead to the transfer of power to India.  It ignited the Civil Disobedience Movement, which involved widespread protests, arrests, and continued struggle for independence.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on polity and governance aspects related to the Indian independence movement and Gandhian philosophy.


**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and actions, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's philosophy emphasized a strict separation between belief and action, prioritizing theoretical ideals over practical application.
2. The Champaran Satyagraha marked Gandhi's first major experiment with Satyagraha in India, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers.
3. Gandhi's support for the Ahmedabad mill strike involved a fast-unto-death to secure a wage increase for workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi strongly believed in the unity of thought and action, his philosophy of truth and non-violence was meant for daily life and not just abstract ideas.  His actions consistently demonstrated this principle.  The Champaran Satyagraha (Statement 2) was indeed Gandhi's first major Satyagraha in India, highlighting the oppression faced by indigo farmers under the British Raj. This involved direct engagement and civil disobedience, showcasing his practical application of philosophy. Statement 3 is also correct; Gandhi's fast-unto-death during the Ahmedabad mill strike successfully pressured mill owners into granting a significant wage increase to the workers.  This demonstrates his ability to mobilize and influence through non-violent means.


**2. With reference to the Rowlatt Act and Gandhi's response, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act aimed to curb the freedom of the press and restrict public assembly.
2. Gandhi's Satyagraha Sabha pledged to disobey the Rowlatt Act through non-violent means.
3. The Rowlatt Satyagraha was the first instance of Gandhi employing civil disobedience in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Rowlatt Act gave the government extraordinary powers to suppress dissent, including the ability to detain individuals without trial, effectively curtailing freedom of speech and assembly. However, it did not directly target the press in the same way as other acts. Statement 2 is accurate.  The Satyagraha Sabha, founded by Gandhi, explicitly aimed to defy the Rowlatt Act through non-violent civil disobedience, initiating a new phase in the Indian nationalist struggle.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Rowlatt Satyagraha was a significant step in Gandhi's use of civil disobedience, it was preceded by the Champaran Satyagraha.  The Champaran Satyagraha represented the first instance of Gandhi applying his technique on a large scale in India, while the Rowlatt Satyagraha was a more widespread movement.


**3. With reference to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The massacre took place in response to the arrest of popular leaders Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlu and Dr. Satyapal in Amritsar.
2. General Dyer's actions were widely condemned by all sections of Indian society, including loyalists.
3. The massacre directly led to the immediate launch of a nationwide, coordinated armed rebellion against the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was a direct response to the arrest of Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlu and Dr. Satyapal, leading to a large gathering of unarmed protesters who were then fired upon. Statement 2 is partially correct. While the massacre was widely condemned within India, the response varied.  While many Indians, including some loyalists, were horrified, the British government's initial response was to defend Dyer's actions.  The extent of condemnation varied across different groups and individuals. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was a horrific event that galvanized Indian sentiment against the British, but it did not immediately trigger a nationwide, coordinated armed rebellion.  While it fueled further resistance, the response was largely non-violent and organized through existing political structures.


**4. With reference to Gandhi's views on Hindu-Muslim unity, untouchability, and women's rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi prioritized Hindu-Muslim unity as a critical aspect of Indian independence, actively working towards communal harmony.
2. Gandhi's efforts against untouchability were limited to public pronouncements, with minimal practical action taken.
3.  Gandhi advocated for equal rights for women but held traditional views on their roles within the family.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi consistently emphasized the importance of Hindu-Muslim unity, viewing it as essential for India's independence and social progress. He actively worked to bridge the communal divide through various initiatives and appeals. Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi dedicated a significant portion of his life to combating untouchability, undertaking various campaigns and establishing organizations like the Harijan Sevak Sangh. His efforts involved both public advocacy and practical measures aimed at social reform. Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi championed women's rights and their emancipation from societal constraints, yet his views on their roles within the family were often traditional, reflecting the societal norms of his time.  He pushed for women's participation in the freedom struggle but also emphasized their traditional roles as caregivers and homemakers.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement's suspension following the Chauri Chaura incident demonstrated Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence.
2. The Khilafat movement's decline after the abolition of the Caliphate rendered the Non-Cooperation Movement irrelevant.
3.  The Non-Cooperation Movement resulted in widespread peasant uprisings across various regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement after the Chauri Chaura incident, where violence erupted, underscores his strict adherence to non-violent principles.  He believed that non-violence was crucial for the movement's success and its moral integrity. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Khilafat movement's decline did impact the Non-Cooperation Movement, it did not render it entirely irrelevant.  The movement addressed broader concerns about India's self-governance and had significant impacts independent of the Khilafat issue. Statement 3 is largely correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement did witness significant peasant participation and resulted in uprisings in several regions. While not all participation was uniformly categorized as "widespread peasant uprisings," the movement's reach extended beyond urban areas and stimulated rural unrest.


**6. With reference to the early nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily employed constitutional methods, focusing on petitions and legislative reforms.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's economic analysis highlighted the drain of wealth from India to Britain.
3. The early nationalists' demands for economic reforms were largely ignored by the British government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian National Congress focused on constitutional methods, working within the existing political system to advocate for reforms through petitions and participation in legislative councils. Statement 2 is also correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work exposed the economic exploitation of India under British rule, demonstrating the "drain of wealth" theory. This analysis became a cornerstone of nationalist economic arguments. Statement 3 is also largely correct. While some minor reforms were implemented, the British government largely ignored the substantial economic demands of the early nationalists.  The core issues of economic exploitation and poverty remained largely unaddressed.


**7. With reference to the partition of Bengal and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was primarily a response to administrative concerns within the Bengal Presidency.
2. The Swadeshi movement was a direct consequence of the partition, encompassing boycotts and promotion of Indian goods.
3. The partition ultimately strengthened the unity of Bengal and fostered stronger Hindu-Muslim relations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While administrative concerns were cited as a rationale, the partition of Bengal also had underlying political motives aimed at weakening nationalist sentiment.  The British government hoped to divide and rule the region.  Statement 2 is correct. The partition sparked widespread opposition, leading to the Swadeshi movement, which involved boycotts of British goods and a conscious effort to promote Indian industries and products. Statement 3 is incorrect. The partition of Bengal had the opposite effect; it fueled nationalist sentiment and, ultimately, exacerbated Hindu-Muslim tensions, which played a significant role in the events leading up to the partition of India.  The movement did not strengthen the unity of Bengal nor improve Hindu-Muslim relations.


**8. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms significantly increased the number of elected Indian members in legislative councils.
2.  The reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims.
3. The reforms granted Indians substantial control over the budget and executive functions of the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms did increase the number of elected Indian members in legislative councils, albeit indirectly and with limitations.  The increase, however, was not as substantial as demanded by nationalists. Statement 2 is also correct. A crucial aspect of the reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, allowing them to elect their representatives separately from other communities. This provision had long-term consequences for communal politics in India. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The reforms did not grant Indians significant control over the budget or executive functions. The British government retained substantial control over these key areas of governance.


**9. With reference to the early contributions of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress initially focused on limited demands, aiming for gradual reforms within the existing system.
2. The Congress immediately called for complete independence upon its founding.
3. The Congress successfully achieved all its initial demands for constitutional reforms within the first decade of its existence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. In its early years, the Indian National Congress adopted a moderate approach, focusing on gradual reforms within the existing British system.  The primary goal was not immediate independence but rather increased Indian participation in governance. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Congress did not immediately call for complete independence. This demand emerged later as the movement evolved and the British government's response to initial demands proved inadequate. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Congress did not achieve all its initial demands for constitutional reforms in the first decade.  While some progress was made, many of their key demands remained unmet, leading to increased frustration and a shift towards more radical approaches.


**10. With reference to the social reform movements of the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Rammohun Roy was a key figure in advocating for the abolition of Sati.
2. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a significant role in promoting widow remarriage.
3. These movements were universally accepted and implemented without significant opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raja Rammohun Roy was a leading voice in the campaign against Sati, actively advocating for its abolition.  His efforts played a significant role in persuading the British government to outlaw the practice. Statement 2 is also correct. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a prominent figure in the movement for widow remarriage, actively campaigning for legal and social reforms to enable widows to remarry.  His work was instrumental in bringing about legislative changes. Statement 3 is incorrect. The social reform movements of the 19th century faced considerable opposition from conservative sections of society.  The reforms challenged established social norms and traditions, resulting in resistance from various groups and individuals who upheld the status quo.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. With reference to the pre-1857 British policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British administration's post-1857 policies, ostensibly aimed at modernization, were characterized by reactionary measures, citing Indian unsuitability for self-governance.
2.  The British actively employed a "divide and rule" strategy, fostering conflict between princes and subjects, regions, provinces, castes, and religious groups (Hindus and Muslims).
3. The British consistently supported social reforms in India to improve the lives of the Indian populace and to foster a positive image of their rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The target content explicitly mentions the British adopting "blatantly reactionary policies" after 1857 under the pretext of Indian unfitness for self-rule. This directly contradicts their earlier intentions of modernization.  The shift towards a reactionary approach is a key aspect of understanding the complexities of British rule in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the deliberate British policy of "divide and rule," exploiting existing societal divisions for maintaining their control.  This strategy is crucial in analyzing the long-term consequences of British rule and the challenges faced by post-colonial India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the British, in their pursuit of reactionary policies, "withdrew support to social reforms" after deciding to ally with conservative social groups.  This demonstrates a deliberate policy shift away from supporting social progress, which is a significant point for understanding the British approach to governance in India.  The support for social reforms was not consistent, but rather a tool used selectively to achieve political goals.


**2. With reference to the predecessors of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The Landholders’ Society, founded in 1837, primarily focused on advocating for broader public interests and administrative reforms.
2. The British India Association, formed in 1851, was a merger of the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British Indian Society and worked for administrative reform and Indian participation in administration.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association, established in London in 1866, primarily aimed at influencing British public opinion on Indian economic issues, and had no branches in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Landholders’ Society, as per the text, primarily aimed at promoting the class interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. While it engaged in some advocacy for public interests, its primary focus was on the concerns of the landowning class. This distinction is important for understanding the socio-economic dynamics of the time.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the British India Association was formed through the merger of the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British Indian Society in 1851.  Its objectives included administrative reform and increased Indian participation in governance. This highlights the evolution of early nationalist organizations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the East India Association, founded by Dadabhai Naoroji in London in 1866, focused on influencing British public opinion, the text explicitly notes that Naoroji later established branches of the Association in prominent Indian cities. This emphasizes the organization's broader reach and strategy.


**3.  With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, primarily implemented in the Madras Presidency, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, with the state’s share fixed at one-third of the gross produce.
2. The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of northern India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities, with the village headman responsible for collection.
3. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal and Bihar, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their lands in perpetuity, with a fixed revenue demand.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (d) All three

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the British revenue systems in India.  Statement 1 correctly describes the Ryotwari system's direct collection from ryots (cultivators) and the initial one-third gross produce share, although this was later modified. Statement 2 accurately depicts the Mahalwari system's village-community based revenue assessment and the headman's role. Statement 3 correctly outlines the Permanent Settlement's grant of proprietary rights to zamindars and the fixed revenue demand.  Understanding these different revenue systems is vital for comprehending the socio-economic impact of British rule and the resulting agrarian structures. The variations and shortcomings of each system, as discussed in the text, also offer valuable insights into the complexities of British policies.


**4. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently promoted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs throughout their rule.
2. The Industrial Revolution in Britain significantly influenced British policies in India, leading to a desire to transform Indian society to create a larger market for British goods.
3.  The British actively supported the Christian missionary efforts to spread Christianity in India, viewing it as a means to undermine native culture and beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that while initially there was a policy of non-interference, this changed after 1813 as new interests and ideas emerged in Britain.  The British later actively intervened in Indian social and religious life, sometimes supporting and sometimes opposing reform efforts depending on their political expediency. This shows a nuanced and evolving policy rather than a consistent one of non-interference.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly links the Industrial Revolution's impact on British policies in India, noting the desire to create a market for British goods. This highlights the economic motivations behind British policies and the resulting changes in Indian society.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the Christian missionaries' role in supporting both the Radicals and the Imperialists. The missionaries' aim was to spread Christianity through Westernization, aiming to undermine Indian culture and religion. This reveals the intertwined nature of religious and political goals in British imperial policy.


**5. With reference to the impact of British land revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British land revenue systems led to the enrichment of the peasantry and the strengthening of village communities.
2. The introduction of private land ownership under British systems resulted in increased agricultural productivity and rural prosperity.
3. The British land revenue systems contributed to the impoverishment of the peasantry, the growth of rural indebtedness, and the emergence of absentee landlordism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The target content extensively details the negative consequences of the British land revenue systems on the peasantry, leading to impoverishment and the weakening of village communities.  The systems, far from enriching the peasantry, often led to their exploitation and dispossession.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the systems did introduce a new form of private land ownership, this did not result in increased agricultural productivity or rural prosperity.  Instead, it exacerbated existing inequalities and led to the concentration of land in the hands of a few, often absentee landlords.  This resulted in the decline of traditional village structures and the impoverishment of many cultivators.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly describes the devastating effects of the British revenue systems, including the impoverishment of the peasantry, the rise of rural indebtedness, and the growth of absentee landlordism.  These are key points to understand the long-term socio-economic consequences of British rule in India.  The high revenue demands, coupled with inefficient collection methods and the rise of moneylenders, created a system that systematically disadvantaged the rural population.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects derived from the historical context of British rule in India.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British pursued a consistent policy of modernization in India from the pre-1857 period onwards.
2. The "divide and rule" policy primarily focused on creating divisions between princely states and their subjects.
3. The British actively encouraged the growth of modern education among Indians throughout their rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British initially had some intentions of modernizing India, their policies after 1857 became overtly reactionary, based on the belief that Indians were unfit for self-governance.  Their approach shifted from modernization to maintaining control and suppressing nationalist sentiments.

Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete.  The "divide and rule" policy was indeed a key aspect of British governance, but it extended far beyond the relationship between princely states and their subjects. It involved exploiting existing social and religious divisions (caste, religion, region) to prevent a unified nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British attitude towards modern education among Indians changed significantly over time. While initially encouraging it to a degree, they became hostile to modern education and its influence on nationalist leadership once the nationalist movement gained momentum. This hostility stemmed from the recognition that educated Indians were more likely to challenge British rule.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement system aimed to establish direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots).
2. The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in the Madras Presidency, granted zamindars proprietary rights over land.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, assessed revenue collectively at the village level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement system, implemented in Bengal and other areas, established a fixed land revenue settlement with zamindars, who then collected revenue from the ryots. It did not involve direct collection from individual cultivators.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ryotwari system, implemented in Madras Presidency and other areas, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots), bypassing the zamindari system. Zamindars did not hold proprietary rights under this system.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahalwari system did assess revenue collectively, at the village or group of villages (mahal) level.  The village community was considered the owner of the land, and revenue was determined based on the overall produce of the mahal. This differed from both the Permanent Settlement and the Ryotwari systems.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently supported social reforms throughout their rule in India.
2. The Industrial Revolution in Britain had no significant impact on British policies in India.
3. The activities of Christian missionaries were a major factor in influencing British policies and arousing Indian anxieties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. British support for social reforms was inconsistent and often driven by their own political interests.  They initially supported some reforms but later withdrew support when they perceived it threatened their overall control and alliances with conservative elements within Indian society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Industrial Revolution in Britain significantly impacted British policies in India.  The rising industrial interests in Britain sought to transform India into a market for their goods, leading to the pursuit of a certain type of ‘colonial modernization’—partial modernization that served British economic interests.

Statement 3 is correct.  The activities of Christian missionaries in India were a significant factor. Their attempts at conversion and their criticism of Indian culture and religion created anxieties among the Indian population. This religious aspect influenced British policies, contributing to the overall tension and resentment towards British rule.  The British, while not always directly supporting missionary activities, often used them to their advantage.



**4. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. British foreign policy in India primarily focused on promoting Indian economic interests in neighboring countries.
2.  British expansion beyond India's natural frontiers was solely motivated by defensive concerns.
3. The British aimed to limit the influence of other European powers in Asia and Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. British foreign policy in India was fundamentally driven by the interests of British imperialism, not primarily by the economic interests of India itself.  British policies often led to conflicts with neighboring countries, hindering India's own economic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While defensive concerns played a role in British expansion, it was also significantly driven by the desire to expand British commercial and economic interests, and to secure strategic advantages in Asia and Africa.

Statement 3 is correct.  A crucial aspect of British foreign policy in India was to maintain a dominant position in Asia and Africa, limiting the expansion and influence of other European imperialist powers whose colonial interests clashed with those of Britain. This competitive aspect of imperialism shaped British actions in the region.


**5. With reference to the impact of British land revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British land revenue systems led to the enrichment of the peasantry and overall agricultural prosperity.
2. The systems resulted in the growth of absentee landlordism and the impoverishment of many cultivators.
3. The implementation of these systems strengthened the traditional village community structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems—Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari—were generally detrimental to the peasantry.  High revenue demands, coupled with inefficient collection methods and the growth of absentee landlordism, led to widespread impoverishment and indebtedness among cultivators. Agricultural prosperity was not a consistent outcome.

Statement 2 is correct. Absentee landlordism became a significant problem under these systems. Many zamindars and landlords became less involved in the actual management of their lands, focusing primarily on rent extraction. This, combined with high revenue demands, led to the impoverishment of many cultivators.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems significantly weakened the traditional village community structure.  The introduction of new systems of land tenure and revenue collection disrupted established social hierarchies and power structures within villages, often leading to conflict and social disintegration.  The village community’s traditional roles and cohesiveness were disrupted.


**6.  With reference to the British policy towards princely states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  After 1857, the British abandoned their policy of annexing princely states.
2. The British consistently upheld the complete sovereignty and independence of princely states.
3. The growth of nationalist sentiments within princely states did not significantly affect British policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Revolt of 1857 led the British to change their policy towards princely states. The policy of annexation was largely abandoned, as the British recognized the value of maintaining these states as a buffer against future unrest and as allies in maintaining control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British initially maintained a façade of respecting the subsidiary status of princely states, their policy involved significant interference in internal affairs. They exercised paramountcy, asserting their ultimate authority and interfering in the administration of princely states through their residents.  The states were not truly sovereign or independent.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The rise of nationalist and democratic movements within princely states was a significant concern for the British. This led to increased British interference in internal affairs of these states to suppress such movements and maintain their overall control.  The British response to these movements was a major component of their policy.


**7. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms significantly increased the power and influence of elected representatives in the Indian legislative councils.
2. The reforms introduced the system of separate electorates for Muslims.
3. The reforms aimed to establish a parliamentary system of government in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Morley-Minto Reforms did expand the legislative councils, the increase in the number of elected representatives was limited, and the officials still maintained a majority. The councils' powers remained largely advisory, with little real impact on governance.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. This meant that Muslims were grouped into separate constituencies from which only Muslims could be elected. This was a significant step in the British policy of "divide and rule".

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms explicitly aimed to *not* establish a parliamentary system in India.  British officials clearly stated that their intention was not to grant self-government approaching that of the dominions.  The reforms were primarily a strategy to manage and control the growing nationalist movement.


**8. With reference to the growth of communalism in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sayyid Ahmad Khan consistently advocated for a united Indian national movement.
2. The system of separate electorates contributed to the growth of communal divisions.
3. The Muslim League initially supported the Indian National Congress's goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Sayyid Ahmad Khan was initially a moderate figure, later in his life he became a conservative and promoted the idea that the political interests of Hindus and Muslims were distinct and divergent. This contributed to the growth of Muslim communalism and separation from the broader nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The system of separate electorates, introduced in the Morley-Minto Reforms and further solidified in subsequent acts, significantly contributed to the growth of communal divisions. It reinforced the idea of separate Hindu and Muslim identities in the political sphere, hindering the development of a united national movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League's relationship with the Indian National Congress was complex and evolved over time. While there were periods of cooperation, the League increasingly adopted a separatist position, eventually advocating for the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.  The League’s initial stance was not one of support for the Congress.


**9. With reference to the Indian National Congress in its early years (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress initially demanded complete independence as its primary goal.
2.  The Congress primarily consisted of members from the lower castes and working classes.
3. The Congress's early demands focused primarily on constitutional reforms and administrative changes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian National Congress, in its early years, did not initially demand complete independence. Its early demands were more moderate, focusing on greater Indian participation in the administration and constitutional reforms within the British Empire. The demand for complete independence emerged later.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The early Congress leadership was primarily drawn from the upper and middle classes, including lawyers, journalists, intellectuals, and some landlords.  While aiming for the welfare of all Indians, its membership and leadership did not primarily represent the lower castes and working classes.

Statement 3 is correct. The main focus of the Congress in its early years was on constitutional reforms, such as expanding and reforming the legislative councils and increasing Indian representation.  They also focused on administrative changes to make the government more responsive to Indian needs.  Economic concerns, while present, were secondary to these initial political goals.


**10. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Salt Satyagraha was primarily aimed at mobilizing the urban middle class.
2. The movement saw significant participation from women and students.
3. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the immediate and complete grant of independence to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the urban middle class participated, the Salt Satyagraha was specifically designed to mobilize the rural masses by targeting the salt tax, a burden that affected everyone, irrespective of class.  The movement’s symbolic power resonated across all strata, but its core aim was to connect with the rural poor.

Statement 2 is correct. Women and students played a significant role in the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Women actively participated in picketing and protests, while students played a key role in boycotts and demonstrations.  Their participation was a crucial element of the movement's success.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was a temporary truce, not a grant of independence.  The pact led to the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and Congress participation in the Round Table Conferences, but it did not achieve the Congress's ultimate goal of complete independence.  Independence came much later.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to Gandhian philosophy, the early nationalist movement, and the socio-political landscape of India during the early 20th century.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha primarily focused on addressing the grievances of indigo planters against exploitative revenue policies.
2. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike saw Gandhi employing a fast-unto-death to secure a wage increase for mill workers, demonstrating his commitment to worker's rights.
3. The Rowlatt Act, which curtailed civil liberties, prompted Gandhi to initiate the Satyagraha Sabha, marking a shift towards direct political action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Champaran Satyagraha primarily focused on addressing the grievances of the peasantry (not indigo planters) who were excessively oppressed by European planters through exploitative indigo cultivation and pricing practices. Gandhi's intervention led to a reduction in the peasants' burdens.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike is a significant example of Gandhi's use of satyagraha to address labor issues. His fast-unto-death successfully pressured mill owners to grant a wage increase, highlighting his commitment to social justice and workers' rights.  This showcases his pragmatic application of his philosophy beyond agrarian contexts.

Statement 3 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, which allowed for detention without trial, was a major catalyst for Gandhi's shift towards direct political action. The formation of the Satyagraha Sabha and the subsequent pledge to disobey the act marked a significant departure from earlier, more moderate forms of political engagement.  This represented a crucial step in the evolution of Gandhi's political strategy.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderates primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, focusing on petitions, meetings, and resolutions to influence British policy.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's work focused solely on advocating for Indian representation in the British Parliament, neglecting economic concerns.
3. The British government consistently responded positively to the demands of the early nationalist movement, implementing most of the reforms advocated.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early nationalist movement, often characterized as the "Moderate" phase, primarily relied on constitutional methods.  They worked within the existing legal framework, utilizing petitions, public meetings, and resolutions to press for reforms and increased Indian representation in governance.  This approach reflected a belief in the possibility of achieving progress through persuasion and dialogue within the colonial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions extended beyond parliamentary representation. He was a pioneer in exposing the economic drain of British rule on India through his meticulous research and writings. His work highlighted the exploitative nature of British economic policies and their devastating impact on the Indian economy. This laid the groundwork for later nationalist movements' focus on economic self-sufficiency.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British government's response to the early nationalist movement was largely negative. While some minor concessions were made, major demands for self-government and substantial political reforms were consistently rejected. This resistance fueled the growth of more radical nationalist factions and eventually led to more assertive forms of political action.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The movement's success was largely due to the widespread participation of the princely states, which actively supported the campaign against British rule.
2. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the suspension of the movement by Gandhi, highlighting his unwavering commitment to non-violence.
3.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate, played a negligible role in mobilizing Muslim participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement saw limited participation from the princely states.  Their rulers largely remained loyal to the British, fearing the potential consequences of supporting the movement. The movement primarily mobilized support from within British India, particularly amongst the peasantry and urban middle classes.


Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors attacked and burned a police station, resulting in deaths, is a critical turning point in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhi, deeply committed to non-violence, saw this as a violation of the movement's principles and suspended the mass civil disobedience campaign. This decision, though controversial at the time, underscored his unwavering commitment to non-violent methods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Khilafat issue, which concerned the fate of the Ottoman Caliph and the perceived threat to Muslim religious sensibilities, was a crucial factor in mobilizing Muslim participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The shared concerns over the Caliphate and British rule created a powerful bond between Hindu and Muslim nationalists, temporarily fostering unprecedented levels of inter-religious cooperation within the movement. The subsequent decline of the Khilafat movement did not erase its early importance.


**4. With reference to the post-Civil Disobedience Movement period (1934-1937), consider the following statements:**

1. Jawaharlal Nehru strongly advocated for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience, rejecting any form of participation in the constitutional framework established by the Government of India Act, 1935.
2.  The Congress's decision to participate in the 1937 provincial elections was primarily driven by a belief in the efficacy of constitutional means to achieve independence.
3. Gandhi initially opposed the acceptance of office by the Congress in the provinces, but later relented, seeing it as a strategic opportunity to work within the system while maintaining the ultimate goal of independence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nehru was critical of the 1935 Act and advocated for a more radical approach, he didn't completely reject participation in the constitutional framework. His position was more nuanced, advocating for using the electoral process strategically to advance the nationalist cause while maintaining the ultimate goal of complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Congress's decision to participate in the 1937 elections wasn't solely based on a belief in constitutional means. The decision was primarily strategic, recognizing that the electoral process could be utilized to further the nationalist agenda and build support for independence, even while rejecting the underlying colonial framework of the 1935 Act.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi initially expressed reservations about the Congress accepting office in the provinces after the 1937 elections. However, he eventually conceded, viewing it as a tactical move to use the opportunities provided by the provincial autonomy to further the nationalist cause and advance the agenda of self-governance. This demonstrates his pragmatism in adapting his strategies to the political context.



**5. Consider the following statements about the differences between Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose:**

1. Gandhi's staunch belief in non-violence was fundamentally at odds with Bose's support for armed struggle as a necessary means to achieve independence.
2.  Both Gandhi and Bose shared a common vision for a post-independence India based on a capitalist economic model, differing only in their approach to achieving it.
3. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II was primarily driven by a pragmatic assessment of the political landscape, rather than an ideological alignment with fascist ideologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A fundamental difference between Gandhi and Bose lay in their approaches to achieving independence. Gandhi remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violent resistance (satyagraha), while Bose, increasingly disillusioned with the slow pace of progress through non-violent means, advocated for armed struggle, believing it to be more effective against the entrenched colonial power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While both Gandhi and Bose envisioned a socialist post-independence India, their interpretations of socialism differed significantly. Gandhi advocated for a decentralized, village-based economy rooted in traditional crafts and self-sufficiency.  Bose, on the other hand, favored industrialization and state-led economic planning, drawing inspiration from socialist models of rapid industrial development.

Statement 3 is correct. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II is a complex and controversial aspect of his life. While he admired certain aspects of their discipline and organization, his primary motivation was strategic. He sought to exploit the wartime opportunity to leverage support from the Axis powers to gain an advantage in the struggle for Indian independence.  Historians generally agree that his collaboration was primarily pragmatic, not ideologically driven by a belief in fascism.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to British administrative policies in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British administration, contrary to its pre-1857 intentions, implemented overtly reactionary policies, citing Indians' unsuitability for self-governance.
2.  The "divide and rule" policy actively fostered conflict between princely states and their populace, and between various religious and caste groups.
3. The British consistently supported social reform movements to modernize Indian society and counter conservative elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  After the 1857 revolt, the British shifted from a somewhat modernizing approach to a blatantly reactionary one, using the pretext of Indian unfitness for self-rule to justify continued colonial control.  Statement 2 is also correct. The British "divide and rule" policy is a well-documented aspect of their governance, intentionally exacerbating existing social and religious divisions to maintain power.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the British initially showed some support for certain reform movements, they later withdrew this support, actively siding with conservative elements when those reforms threatened their authority or the status quo beneficial to their interests.  The British often used the support of conservative elements as a counterweight against the growing nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted zamindars complete ownership rights, leading to increased agricultural productivity and peasant prosperity.
2. The Ryotwari system, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly taxed cultivators, resulting in higher revenue for the British but also widespread peasant indebtedness.
3. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, involved collective taxation of villages, leading to greater equity in land distribution and preventing the rise of absentee landlords.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement did grant zamindars proprietary rights, it did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or peasant prosperity. Instead, it led to widespread exploitation of peasants by zamindars and the rise of absentee landlordism. The high revenue demands often exceeded the land's capacity, leading to zamindari bankruptcies and further impoverishment of the peasantry. Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari system did directly tax cultivators, resulting in higher revenue for the British but also severe peasant indebtedness due to high and inflexible tax rates, often exceeding the land's capacity to yield. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, while initially aiming for village-level collective taxation, often resulted in inequitable distribution and did not prevent the rise of absentee landlords.  The system was complex and prone to corruption, leading to the exploitation of cultivators.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially followed a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious affairs until the early 19th century when they actively promoted social reforms aligned with utilitarian principles.
2.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, aimed at controlling the nationalist press, was eventually repealed due to public outcry.
3.  Christian missionaries actively supported both conservative and radical factions within the British administration, primarily to advance their religious agenda and commercial interests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While the British initially pursued a policy of non-interference, their approach shifted in the 19th century. However, their support for social reforms was often inconsistent and driven by utilitarian principles and self-interest rather than a consistent commitment to social justice.  Statement 2 is correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 faced significant opposition and was repealed in 1882 due to public pressure.  Statement 3 is correct. Christian missionaries strategically aligned themselves with both conservative and radical factions within the British administration.  Their support was primarily motivated by the desire to spread Christianity and often intertwined with economic and political interests. They saw both approaches as potentially beneficial to their goal of converting the Indian population.


**4. With reference to British foreign policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British foreign policy in India primarily aimed at securing the Indian empire, expanding commercial interests, and preventing other European powers from gaining influence in Asia.
2.  British expansion beyond India's natural frontiers led to conflicts with neighboring countries and other European powers like Russia and France.
3. The costs of British foreign policy, including wars and military expenditures, were primarily borne by the British government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the primary objectives of British foreign policy in India.  The protection of the valuable Indian empire, the expansion of British trade and economic interests, and the containment of rival European powers were central to their strategic thinking. Statement 2 is also correct. British expansionist policies in Asia frequently led to conflicts with neighboring states and other European powers whose colonial ambitions clashed with those of Britain. This resulted in numerous wars and border skirmishes. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Britain ultimately benefited from its imperial ventures, the financial and human costs of their foreign policy, including wars and military expeditions, were largely borne by India. The Indian tax base and Indian soldiers were heavily exploited to fund these policies.


**5. With reference to the impact of British land revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All three systems—Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari—resulted in increased agricultural productivity and improved the economic condition of the peasantry.
2. The systems led to the rise of absentee landlordism, increased peasant indebtedness, and the commercialization of agriculture.
3.  The British land revenue systems strengthened the traditional village community structure and fostered social harmony.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems, despite their variations, generally led to the impoverishment of the peasantry rather than their economic improvement. High tax rates, inflexible collection methods, and the growth of absentee landlordism all contributed to widespread rural indebtedness and hardship. Statement 2 is correct. The British land revenue systems significantly altered the agrarian structure, resulting in the rise of absentee landlordism, increased peasant indebtedness, and the commercialization of agriculture, disrupting traditional village economies and social structures. Statement 3 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems significantly weakened the traditional village community structure, fostering social inequality and conflict rather than harmony. The introduction of new systems of land tenure and revenue collection disrupted existing social hierarchies and power dynamics within villages.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects within the broader context of the Indian National Movement.


**1. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists primarily advocated for complete independence from British rule, employing methods of open defiance and mass civil disobedience.
2.  The focus on constitutional agitation and gradual reform characterized the approach of moderate nationalists, who believed in working within the existing legal framework.
3.  The early nationalists consistently prioritized economic reforms, advocating for immediate nationalization of key industries and complete protectionist trade policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 accurately reflects the strategy of moderate nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale.  They believed in constitutional methods, petitions, and gradual reforms within the existing British system. They aimed to build public opinion and persuade the British government to introduce reforms.  Statement 1 is incorrect; complete independence was not the immediate goal of early nationalists. While the desire for self-rule existed, the methods were initially more moderate and focused on gradual change within the British framework.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While economic exploitation was a significant concern, the early nationalists did not advocate for immediate nationalization of industries or complete protectionism. Their economic proposals were more moderate, focusing on the development of indigenous industries and gradual economic reforms.


**2. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress, from its inception, vehemently opposed all forms of British rule and actively promoted armed rebellion as its primary method of achieving independence.
2.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, partly motivated by a desire to provide a "safety valve" for growing nationalist sentiment.
3.  The early Congress leadership comprised primarily wealthy and aristocratic individuals, with limited representation from the broader masses of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes A.O. Hume's role and the "safety valve" theory, which posited that providing a platform for moderate expression could prevent more radical uprisings.  Statement 3 is also largely true.  The early Congress was dominated by the educated elite, primarily from upper-caste backgrounds.  While they represented a significant segment of Indian society, the masses were largely unrepresented in the initial years.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The early Congress did not advocate for armed rebellion. Its initial focus was on constitutional methods and gradual reforms. The movement's tactics evolved over time, becoming more assertive and eventually embracing non-violent civil disobedience under Gandhi's leadership.


**3. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms introduced universal adult suffrage, granting all Indian citizens the right to vote regardless of caste, creed, or gender.
2.  The reforms significantly increased Indian representation in the legislative councils, granting Indians a substantial majority in these bodies.
3.  The reforms established separate electorates for Muslims, a move that had long-term consequences for communal harmony in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 correctly identifies the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims as a key feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms. This policy, while intended to appease Muslim concerns, ultimately contributed to the deepening of communal divisions in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The reforms did not introduce universal adult suffrage. Voting rights remained limited to a small percentage of the population.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Indian representation increased, it did not grant Indians a majority in the legislative councils. Officials and nominated members still held significant power.  The reforms were a step towards greater Indian participation but fell short of substantial political empowerment.


**4.  With reference to the Swadeshi Movement (1905-1909), consider the following statements:**

1. The Swadeshi Movement was solely focused on economic boycott, with no political objectives or aspirations for self-rule.
2.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from diverse sections of Indian society, including students, women, and workers, expanding its social base beyond the elite.
3.  The movement's success was significantly hampered by internal divisions and lack of a unified organizational structure, leading to its eventual decline.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the broader participation in the Swadeshi Movement.  It involved students, women, and workers, significantly broadening its social base.  Statement 3 is also correct. The movement suffered from internal divisions between moderates and extremists, and lacked a strong, unified organizational structure, contributing to its decline by 1908.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swadeshi Movement had both economic and political objectives. While boycotting foreign goods was a key strategy, the movement also aimed to promote Indian self-reliance and ultimately challenged British rule.  The movement’s impact extended beyond economics to encompass political awareness and national identity.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the early Indian nationalist movement's approach to administrative reforms:**

1. Early nationalists advocated for the complete removal of all British officials from the Indian administration and the immediate establishment of an entirely Indian-run government.
2.  They demanded a greater share for Indians in the higher echelons of the civil service, citing economic, political, and moral arguments for this reform.
3.  They consistently opposed the separation of judicial and executive powers within the administration, viewing it as a hindrance to efficient governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the early nationalists' demand for Indianization of the higher civil services. They argued that this would improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the administration's responsiveness to Indian needs.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Complete removal of British officials was not an immediate goal.  The early nationalists aimed for gradual Indianization, not immediate replacement.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  Early nationalists strongly advocated for the separation of judicial and executive powers, recognizing the importance of an independent judiciary for fair and impartial justice.  This separation was seen as crucial for preventing abuse of power and protecting citizens' rights.


**1. With reference to the early twentieth-century Indian revolutionary movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association, founded in 1924, initially focused on armed revolution but later adopted socialist ideals, changing its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association in 1928.
2. Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, assassinated a British police officer in retaliation for a lathi charge on a demonstration led by Lala Lajpat Rai.  This act was justified by the revolutionaries as an act against an "inhuman and unjust order."
3.  The bomb thrown in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929 by Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt, though designed to be harmless, aimed to "make the deaf hear" and served as a platform for revolutionary propaganda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect events and ideologies within the early twentieth-century Indian revolutionary movement.  The Hindustan Republican Association's transformation from a purely armed revolutionary group to one incorporating socialist ideals under Chandra Shekhar Azad is well-documented.  The assassination of the police officer, the context of Lala Lajpat Rai's injury, and the revolutionaries' justification for the act are historically accurate.  Similarly, the Central Legislative Assembly bombing, the bomb's harmless nature, and the revolutionaries' strategic decision to be arrested for propaganda purposes are all established historical facts.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1. The British land revenue policies and administrative systems led to widespread peasant indebtedness and land loss to moneylenders and traders, contributing significantly to popular discontent.
2. The British annexation of Avadh in 1856, justified as a measure to alleviate the people's suffering under the Nawab, actually resulted in increased taxation and further economic hardship for the common people.
3. The exclusion of Indians from high-paying administrative positions, coupled with the dismantling of traditional patronage systems under Indian rulers, led to widespread unemployment and resentment among the middle and upper classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the socio-economic consequences of British rule in India, particularly in the lead-up to the 1857 revolt.  The British land revenue system, with its emphasis on maximizing revenue, created a climate of widespread indebtedness among peasants who often lost their lands to moneylenders. The annexation of Avadh, while presented as a benevolent act, exacerbated existing economic problems and led to further impoverishment and resentment. The British preference for Europeans in higher administrative positions, coupled with the disruption of traditional patronage networks under Indian rulers, resulted in widespread unemployment and a sense of disenfranchisement among the Indian elite.  These factors collectively contributed to the growing dissatisfaction that fueled the 1857 revolt.


**3. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's eleven demands to the British government in 1930 included specific demands related to peasants (land revenue reduction, salt tax abolition) and industrialists (textile protection, coastal shipping reservation).
2. The Dandi March, starting on March 12, 1930, symbolized the Indian people's resolve to defy British laws, culminating in Gandhi breaking the salt law at Dandi on April 6th.
3. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact of March 1931, while achieving some concessions from the British government, notably failed to secure the release of Bhagat Singh and his comrades from the death penalty, leading to continued unrest.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of events and strategies during the Civil Disobedience Movement. Gandhi's eleven demands indeed encompassed a range of issues, targeting both rural and urban populations, reflecting the diverse grievances against British rule. The Dandi March is accurately described as a symbolic act of defiance, culminating in the breaking of the salt law, triggering widespread civil disobedience. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, while a significant step toward negotiation and some concessions, notably failed to prevent the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru, highlighting the limitations of the agreement and the continued tensions between the Indian nationalist movement and the British government.  The statements accurately reflect the complexities and nuances of the period.


**4. With reference to the making of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report of 1928, drafted in response to Lord Birkenhead's challenge, provided a framework for a dominion status constitution that included fundamental rights and a federal system with provincial autonomy.
2.  The Constituent Assembly, formed in 1946, was indirectly elected and not based on universal adult suffrage, reflecting the limitations imposed by the existing political system.
3. The Drafting Committee, chaired by B.R. Ambedkar, prepared a detailed draft constitution that was debated and amended extensively in the Constituent Assembly before its final adoption in 1949.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe key aspects of the Indian Constitution's creation. The Nehru Report served as a crucial precursor, outlining many features later incorporated into the final constitution.  The Constituent Assembly's indirect election and the absence of universal adult suffrage are accurate reflections of the political realities of the time. The extensive work of the Drafting Committee, the public consultations, and the extensive debates and amendments within the Constituent Assembly are all well-established historical facts. The statements accurately reflect the process, highlighting both its achievements and its compromises.


**5. With reference to the challenges faced by newly independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Radcliffe Boundary Award, announced after independence, led to widespread communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal, resulting in significant loss of life and displacement.
2. The partition resulted in the massive resettlement of refugees, with the Indian government establishing the Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation to address the crisis, although the process was often uneven and discriminatory.
3. The Nehru-Liaquat Pact of 1950 aimed to resolve the refugee problem and restore communal harmony, but faced criticism from Hindu nationalists who advocated for a more forceful approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately reflect the immense challenges faced by India in the aftermath of partition. The Radcliffe Line's hasty demarcation and the resulting communal violence, particularly in Punjab, are well-documented historical events.  The scale of refugee resettlement, the government's efforts, and the inequalities within the relief efforts are also historically accurate. The Nehru-Liaquat Pact, while aiming for reconciliation, faced strong opposition from Hindu nationalists who favored a more assertive stance, reflecting the deep political divisions of the period.  The statements provide a balanced and accurate picture of a highly complex and turbulent period.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall.


**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress was founded primarily as a safety valve to alleviate growing Indian discontent, as believed by Lala Lajpat Rai and supported by some Marxist historians.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his economic critiques, effectively countered the British claim of benevolent rule by highlighting the "drain of wealth" from India.
3.  The Moderates' campaign for constitutional reforms focused solely on expanding the power of legislative councils, neglecting demands for wider suffrage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While Lala Lajpat Rai and some Marxist historians did support the "safety valve" theory,  modern historians largely refute this simplistic view, arguing that the INC represented a genuine desire for a national platform for Indian political and economic demands. The INC's formation, facilitated by A.O. Hume, was a strategic move to navigate the complexities of colonial rule.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" provided a powerful economic critique of British rule, exposing the systematic exploitation of India's resources and wealth transfer to Britain. This analysis undermined the British narrative of benevolent governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Moderates did focus on expanding and reforming legislative councils (demanding greater Indian representation and powers), their campaign also encompassed broader constitutional reforms and, over time, evolved to include demands for self-government on the lines of self-governing colonies, as advocated by Gokhale and Naoroji.  They did not, however, initially demand universal suffrage.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee's findings all contributed to widespread Indian discontent and fueled the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was crucial in uniting Hindu and Muslim populations against British rule, though it was ultimately a religious issue.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob set fire to a police station, led to the immediate and complete suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the perceived whitewashing of the Punjab atrocities by the Hunter Committee significantly eroded trust in British governance and fueled widespread resentment, creating a fertile ground for the Non-Cooperation Movement.  These events highlighted the brutal nature of colonial rule.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Khilafat issue, while rooted in the religious sentiments of Indian Muslims regarding the Ottoman Caliphate, effectively served as a unifying factor, bringing together Hindus and Muslims in a common struggle against British imperialism.  However, the underlying cause was political, not solely religious.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Chauri Chaura incident was a pivotal moment that deeply concerned Gandhi due to the violence involved, it led to the *suspension* of the mass civil disobedience phase of the Non-Cooperation Movement, not its immediate and complete termination. Gandhi believed that the movement's non-violent nature was crucial for its success.  The movement's constructive programs continued after the suspension.


**3. With reference to the emergence of Swarajists, Socialist ideas, and revolutionary activities in the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajist Party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated entering legislative councils to obstruct the government from within, ultimately aiming for complete independence.
2.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was primarily driven by socialist ideals from its inception, rejecting any form of violence.
3.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, demonstrated the rise of revolutionary activity in Bengal, characterized by the significant participation of women.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Swarajists, while initially aiming to "end or mend" the legislative councils, ultimately aimed to use these platforms to obstruct the government and advance the cause of self-government, eventually evolving towards the goal of complete independence.  Their strategy was a pragmatic approach within the existing political system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The HRA, while eventually evolving to incorporate socialist ideals under the HSRA, did not reject violence from its inception.  The initial focus was on armed revolution to overthrow the colonial government. The shift towards socialism came later.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid was a significant event in the history of the Indian revolutionary movement, highlighting the growing militancy in Bengal and the remarkable participation of women revolutionaries who played active roles in the raid and subsequent activities.



**4. With reference to the Indian working-class movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early Indian nationalists, particularly the Moderates, actively championed the cause of Indian workers, advocating for improved working conditions and higher wages.
2.  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), founded in 1920, initially embraced Gandhian principles of non-violence and class collaboration, later evolving to incorporate communist influences.
3.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case (1929), involving the arrest and trial of numerous trade union and communist leaders, severely weakened the Indian working-class movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The early Indian nationalists, particularly the Moderates, were largely indifferent to the workers' cause, often prioritizing other political and economic concerns. Their approach was often characterized by a lack of engagement with labor issues.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AITUC, while initially influenced by Gandhian ideals of non-violence and class collaboration, also experienced a significant shift towards communist ideologies and strategies in its later years, reflecting the broader changes within the Indian political landscape.

Statement 3 is correct. The Meerut Conspiracy Case, a major crackdown on communist and trade union leaders, significantly hampered the growth and organization of the Indian working-class movement for a considerable period.  The lengthy trial and harsh sentences dealt a severe blow to the movement's momentum.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the Partition of Bengal (1905) on the Indian nationalist movement:**

1. The Partition initially led to a unified response from all sections of the Indian National Congress, with the Moderates and Extremists working together in opposition.
2.  The Swadeshi movement, which emerged in response to the Partition, was primarily focused on boycotting British goods and promoting Indian industries, rather than on achieving complete independence.
3. The Partition led to a significant increase in revolutionary terrorist activities, as many nationalists felt that peaceful methods had failed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Partition did initially unite various factions of the Indian National Congress against the British decision, significant differences and tensions remained between the Moderates and Extremists regarding the methods and goals of the movement.  The unity was temporary and fragile.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The Swadeshi movement did focus on boycotting British goods and supporting Indian industries (“Swadeshi”), but it also played a vital role in galvanizing nationalist sentiment and laying the groundwork for more radical demands for self-rule or complete independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Partition, along with the increasing repression by the British government, significantly contributed to the rise of revolutionary terrorism as a response, with groups resorting to violence as a means to achieve independence.  The failure of purely constitutional methods fueled this radicalization.


**6. With reference to the Subsidiary Alliance system implemented by Lord Wellesley, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Subsidiary Alliance system was primarily designed to protect Indian rulers from external aggression and maintain peace and stability in the region.
2.  Under the system, Indian rulers were required to maintain a large standing army at their own expense, while also ceding territories to the British East India Company.
3. The system resulted in the strengthening of the Indian princely states and a rise in their military capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British presented the Subsidiary Alliance system as a means of protection, its primary aim was to expand British influence and control over Indian territories. The system was a tool of imperial expansion, not benevolent protection.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Subsidiary Alliance system required Indian rulers to disband their own armies and rely on a British-controlled subsidiary force, often maintained at the ruler's expense.  This, along with the cession of territories, significantly weakened the Indian states and enhanced British power.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Subsidiary Alliance system had the opposite effect—it led to the weakening and eventual dismantling of many Indian princely states' military capabilities and political autonomy.  The system was designed to subordinate Indian rulers to British control.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to 18th-century India and its interactions with European powers.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the 18th-century Indian education system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Traditional education primarily focused on literature, law, religion, and philosophy, neglecting scientific and technological subjects.
2.  Centres of higher education were largely financed by the state and wealthy individuals, showcasing decentralized patronage.
3.  Elementary education, while widespread, primarily catered to upper castes, mirroring existing social hierarchies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the 18th-century Indian education system. Statement 1 highlights the traditional, largely religious and literary focus of education, contrasting sharply with the burgeoning scientific advancements in the West.  This lack of emphasis on modern sciences and technology contributed significantly to India's later economic vulnerability to European powers. Statement 2 correctly points out the decentralized nature of educational funding, with nawabs, rajas, and zamindars playing a crucial role. This highlights the diverse power structures of the time and the lack of a unified, centralized system of education under the weakening Mughal empire. Statement 3 accurately describes the limited access to education for lower castes, reflecting the deep-seated social inequalities that shaped Indian society. This limited access to education further contributed to the social and economic disparities exploited by the British during colonization.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to encompass the full picture presented in the source material.


**2. With reference to the socio-cultural dynamics of 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system rigidly defined social hierarchies and professional choices, though exceptions existed.
2.  While Islam advocated social equality, internal divisions based on caste, race, and status were prevalent among Muslims.
3.  The patriarchal family structure, dominant across most of India, placed women under significant male control, although exceptions like Ahilya Bai existed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided statements accurately describe the complex social fabric of 18th-century India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the rigid caste system as a defining feature of Hindu society, but acknowledges the existence of exceptions and fluidity within the system. This nuance is crucial for understanding the complexities of social mobility and the inherent contradictions within the system. Statement 2 accurately points out the internal divisions within Muslim society, despite the religious ideal of equality. This highlights the limitations of religious ideals in overcoming entrenched social hierarchies and the existence of parallel social structures within different religious communities. Statement 3 correctly describes the patriarchal family structure as the norm, while acknowledging exceptions like Ahilya Bai Holkar, who ruled Indore effectively. This demonstrates the limitations of generalizations and the existence of individual agency within broader societal constraints. The other options are incomplete as they fail to address the totality of the social realities presented in the source material.


**3.  Consider the following statements regarding the economic aspects of 18th-century India:**

1.  India's economy was characterized by a significant export surplus, primarily due to the high demand for its textiles and other manufactured goods.
2.  The flourishing textile industry was concentrated in specific regions but was a significant contributor to India's economic strength.
3.  The shipbuilding industry, while regionally concentrated, was a substantial aspect of India's economic activity and international trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements reflect the economic realities of 18th-century India. Statement 1 accurately depicts India's favorable balance of trade, with exports exceeding imports, largely due to the high demand for its textiles and other products. This surplus, however, did not necessarily translate into widespread prosperity for the Indian population. Statement 2 correctly pinpoints the concentration of the textile industry in specific regions, emphasizing its crucial role in the Indian economy.  The industry's sophistication and global reach are often overlooked in narratives focusing solely on the decline of the Mughal Empire. Statement 3 accurately highlights the importance of the shipbuilding industry, particularly in coastal regions, demonstrating India's capabilities in maritime trade and naval power. This aspect, often underrepresented in historical accounts, reveals a dynamic side of India's economic activity and its interaction with the global economy.  The other options fail to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of India's pre-colonial economy.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of India on the eve of British conquest, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of the Mughal Empire was marked by a succession crisis and the rise of regional powers, each vying for dominance.
2.  The Maratha Empire, despite its military prowess and territorial expansion, faced setbacks like the Third Battle of Panipat, hindering its consolidation.
3.  The emergence of various regional states—successor states, independent kingdoms, and new states—led to a fragmented political map.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the political fragmentation of India in the 18th century. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Mughal succession crisis and the consequent rise of regional powers as key factors in the empire's decline.  This internal weakness created a power vacuum that the British effectively exploited. Statement 2 accurately describes the Maratha Empire's rise and its significant setback at the Third Battle of Panipat.  This battle, while not entirely decisive, significantly altered the balance of power and created opportunities for other contenders. Statement 3 accurately portrays the diverse nature of emerging regional states, highlighting the complex political landscape that characterized the period.  The classification into successor states, independent kingdoms, and new states provides a framework for understanding the various political entities that emerged during this period of transition. The other options, by excluding one or more of these crucial aspects, present an incomplete understanding of the situation.


**5. With reference to the statement  “Bear in mind that the commerce of India is the commerce of the world. He who can exclusively command it is the dictator of Europe,” consider the following statements:**

1. The statement underscores the strategic importance of India's trade in the global economy of the time.
2.  The statement accurately reflects the economic competition among European powers for control over Indian trade.
3. The statement was made by Queen Victoria, highlighting the British perception of India's economic significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately capture the essence of the provided quote. Statement 1 correctly identifies the quote's emphasis on the global economic significance of India's trade. The vastness and richness of Indian trade routes and markets meant that control over them would provide significant economic and political power in the world stage. Statement 2 accurately points out the intense competition among European powers for control over Indian trade.  This competition fueled the expansion of European influence in India and played a crucial role in setting the stage for the British conquest. Statement 3 is incorrect. The statement was not made by Queen Victoria. While Queen Victoria did become Empress of India, this statement reflects the broader European perception of India's economic importance, predating her reign.  The attribution of the quote to a specific European monarch is not crucial; the statement itself reveals the geopolitical implications of controlling India's vast trade networks.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on diverse aspects of socio-cultural and religious reform movements in 19th and early 20th century India, demanding detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prarthana Samaj, founded in Bombay, primarily focused on religious reform, advocating monotheism and challenging traditional Hindu practices.
2. The Arya Samaj, while advocating a return to Vedic principles, also actively worked for social reforms like women's education and opposed untouchability.
3. The Ramakrishna Mission, established by Swami Vivekananda, primarily focused on personal salvation and spiritual practices, with limited involvement in social service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prarthana Samaj, while advocating monotheism, was significantly more involved in social reform than purely religious reform, addressing issues like widow remarriage and women's education.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, is correctly described in statement 2; its "Back to the Vedas" campaign was coupled with significant social reform efforts. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Ramakrishna Mission, a direct outgrowth of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's teachings and established by Vivekananda, was deeply involved in humanitarian work, establishing schools, hospitals, and dispensaries across India.  Its focus was not solely on personal salvation but also on social good and service.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the activities and focuses of at least one of the mentioned reform movements.


**2. With reference to the intellectual currents influencing socio-religious reform in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's reformist ideology primarily drew upon a strict adherence to traditional Hindu scriptures, rejecting Western influences.
2. The Young Bengal Movement, spearheaded by Henry Vivian Derozio, advocated for radical social change, inspired by the French Revolution and emphasizing rationalism.
3. Swami Vivekananda's philosophy, while rooted in Vedanta, emphasized a synthesis between Eastern spirituality and Western materialism, advocating for social action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a staunch proponent of reason and critical inquiry, using rationalism to interpret and reform Hindu traditions. He actively engaged with Western thought and advocated for a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas, not a rejection of Western influences. Statement 2 correctly describes the Young Bengal Movement's radicalism and its inspiration from the French Revolution, emphasizing rational thought and challenging traditional authority. Statement 3 accurately portrays Swami Vivekananda's philosophy as a synthesis of Eastern spirituality and Western pragmatism, underscoring the need for social action and service to humanity.  Option (b) is thus the only correct answer because it accurately reflects the intellectual underpinnings of the Young Bengal movement and Swami Vivekananda’s philosophy.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of various reform movements on Indian society:**

1. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, primarily focused on the upliftment of the upper castes and preserving traditional Hindu social structures.
2. The Self-Respect Movement, led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, advocated for a complete rejection of Brahminical religion and culture, promoting self-respect among lower castes.
3. The SNDP movement, initiated by Sree Narayana Guru, primarily aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of the Ezhavas in Kerala through religious and social reform.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj was explicitly aimed at challenging upper-caste dominance and advocating for the rights and upliftment of marginalized communities, especially the lower castes, not preserving traditional structures. Statement 2 accurately describes the Self-Respect Movement's radical rejection of Brahminical dominance and its focus on promoting self-respect and social justice among lower castes. Statement 3 correctly identifies the SNDP movement's objective of improving the conditions of the Ezhava community in Kerala through a combination of religious and social reforms.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Aligarh Movement and the Deoband School, consider the following statements:**

1. The Aligarh Movement, led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, advocated for the integration of modern Western education with Islamic principles, emphasizing loyalty to the British crown.
2. The Deoband School primarily focused on religious revivalism, emphasizing a strict adherence to traditional Islamic teachings and initially opposing engagement with the Indian National Congress.
3. Both the Aligarh Movement and the Deoband School actively promoted Hindu-Muslim unity and worked collaboratively towards Indian independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Aligarh Movement's aims: modernization of Muslim society through Western education, while maintaining loyalty to the British. Statement 2 correctly describes the Deoband School's focus on religious revivalism and its initial resistance to the Congress.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while both movements aimed for the betterment of the Muslim community, they differed significantly in their approach to politics and their relationship with the Congress.  The Deoband School, initially at least, had a more conservative and separatist stance, unlike the Aligarh Movement, which initially prioritized education and cooperation with the British. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation and peaceful protests, advocating for gradual reforms within the existing British framework.
2.  The early nationalists consistently and unequivocally rejected British rule, demanding immediate and complete independence from the outset.
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji, through his work on "Drain of Wealth," exposed the economic exploitation of India under British rule and played a crucial role in shaping nationalist economic thought.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the approach of the early nationalists, who primarily advocated for constitutional methods and gradual reforms. Statement 2 is incorrect; the early nationalist movement did not initially call for immediate and complete independence, but rather for gradual reforms and greater Indian participation in governance. Statement 3 is correct; Dadabhai Naoroji's work on the "Drain of Wealth" played a pivotal role in highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule, significantly influencing nationalist economic thought.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The other options incorrectly characterize the nature and strategies of the early nationalist movement or the contributions of key figures.


**1. With reference to Gandhian philosophy and its application, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's philosophy emphasized a strict separation between belief and action, prioritizing philosophical discourse over practical application.
2. The Champaran Satyagraha marked Gandhi's first major experiment in Satyagraha in India, focusing on peasant grievances related to indigo cultivation.
3.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike saw Gandhi employ a fast-unto-death to mediate a labor dispute, resulting in a significant wage increase for mill workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's philosophy strongly emphasized the inseparability of thought and practice, belief and action. His principles of truth and non-violence were intended for daily life, not just theoretical discussions.  He consistently demonstrated this through his actions in various Satyagrahas and social reform movements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha (1917) was indeed Gandhi's first major Satyagraha campaign in India.  It addressed the exploitation of indigo peasants by British planters, highlighting the oppressive conditions and successfully challenging the colonial authorities. This marked a crucial step in Gandhi's development as a leader of the Indian independence movement.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) saw Gandhi utilizing his unique method of Satyagraha—a fast unto death—to pressure mill owners into granting a significant wage increase to their workers. This demonstrated his commitment to improving the lives of ordinary Indians and his ability to mobilize public opinion for social and economic justice.  The successful outcome of the strike cemented his position as a powerful mediator and advocate for the working class.


**2. With reference to the Rowlatt Act and its impact on the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, aimed to curtail civil liberties and empower the government to imprison individuals without trial.
2. Gandhi's response to the Rowlatt Act involved organizing large-scale armed rebellion against the British government.
3. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, occurring in April 1919, was a direct consequence of the widespread protests against the Rowlatt Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act (1919) was a highly controversial piece of legislation that allowed the British government to detain individuals suspected of sedition without trial or legal recourse. This severely curtailed civil liberties and fueled widespread resentment among Indians.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi's response to the Rowlatt Act was based on the principle of Satyagraha, emphasizing non-violent civil disobedience.  He did not advocate or participate in armed rebellion. The movement involved protests, boycotts, and civil resistance, not armed conflict.

Statement 3 is correct. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919) was a direct consequence of the growing unrest and protests against the Rowlatt Act and the overall repressive policies of the British government. The massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed, further inflamed anti-British sentiment and profoundly impacted the nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, involved a complete boycott of British goods and institutions, including government services and educational establishments.
2. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash occurred between protestors and police, led to the immediate and unconditional suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Gandhi.
3. The Khilafat movement, focused on the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate, played a significant role in mobilizing Muslim participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) involved a wide-ranging boycott of British goods and institutions, encompassing government services, courts, schools, and other aspects of colonial administration. This was intended to demonstrate mass civil disobedience and pressure the British government to concede to Indian demands.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident (1922), where protestors clashed violently with police, resulting in the death of policemen, deeply troubled Gandhi.  He saw this as a violation of the principles of non-violent resistance upon which the movement was founded and consequently suspended the Non-Cooperation Movement, although not immediately or unconditionally;  he gave a period of reflection before the suspension.

Statement 3 is correct. The Khilafat movement, which aimed to protect the Ottoman Caliphate, played a vital role in bringing Muslim participation into the Non-Cooperation Movement. This collaboration between Hindus and Muslims strengthened the movement's overall impact and demonstrated a degree of inter-religious solidarity in the struggle for national independence.


**4. With reference to the early Nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation and peaceful protests to press for reforms within the existing British framework.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions were primarily focused on social reform, with little engagement in economic analysis or political advocacy.
3. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, immediately adopted a policy of complete independence from British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), often referred to as the Moderate phase, was characterized by constitutional methods of agitation.  Nationalist leaders primarily employed petitions, public meetings, resolutions, and participation within the existing legal framework to advocate for reforms and increased Indian participation in governance.  This approach aimed to persuade the British government to implement gradual changes through peaceful means.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent figure in the early nationalist movement and made significant contributions in both economic analysis and political advocacy. His pioneering work on the "drain of wealth" from India to Britain exposed the exploitative nature of British rule and significantly influenced nationalist thought.  While he also engaged in social reform, his contributions extended far beyond this.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress, at its inception in 1885, did not immediately advocate for complete independence. The early Congress focused on securing reforms within the British system, gradually evolving towards more radical demands for self-rule in later years.  The goal of "Swaraj" (self-rule), while implied, was not explicitly stated as complete independence in the early years.


**5. With reference to the Partition of Bengal and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition of Bengal, implemented in 1905, was widely supported by the Indian population as a means of improving administrative efficiency.
2. The Swadeshi movement, launched in response to the partition, primarily focused on economic boycotts of British goods and promotion of indigenous industries.
3.  The partition of Bengal was ultimately reversed by the British government in 1911, primarily due to the success of the Swadeshi movement’s non-violent protests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Partition of Bengal in 1905 was met with widespread opposition from the Indian population.  It was viewed as a divisive tactic by the British government aimed at weakening the growing nationalist movement by separating the Bengali-speaking population.  The partition sparked significant unrest and protests throughout Bengal and other parts of India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, launched in response to the partition, was a significant nationalist campaign that focused on boycotting British goods and promoting the use of Indian-made products. This economic strategy aimed to weaken the British economy and strengthen India's self-reliance.  The movement also involved the promotion of indigenous industries and the boycott of British educational institutions.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The partition was indeed reversed in 1911. However, while the Swadeshi movement played a role, the decision was influenced by a complex interplay of factors including political considerations, administrative difficulties experienced by the British due to the intense opposition, and the overall changing political landscape in India. The reversal was not solely due to the success of non-violent protests.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the pre-independence Indian political landscape, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Landholders’ Society, established in 1837, primarily focused on advocating for the interests of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa landlords.
2.  The Bengal British Indian Society, founded in 1843, aimed to protect and promote broader public interests, distinct from the specific concerns of the Landholders’ Society.
3.  The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association were established concurrently in 1851, reflecting a simultaneous surge in regional political organization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Landholders’ Society, established in 1837, was indeed an early public association primarily focused on promoting the class interests of landlords in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  This reflects the socio-political realities of the time, where landed gentry played a significant role in early political mobilization.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bengal British Indian Society, established in 1843, had a broader mandate than the Landholders’ Society. While the former focused specifically on landlord interests, the latter aimed to address general public concerns, showcasing a nascent shift towards wider political representation. The merger of these two organizations into the British India Association in 1851 further illustrates the evolving nature of political organizations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Madras Native Association and the Bombay Association were not established concurrently in 1851.  While both were significant regional political organizations, the Madras Native Association was established earlier, in 1852, while the Bombay Association's founding year is also 1852.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, is credited with playing a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.
2.  The initial aims of the Congress included fostering national unity across diverse castes, religions, and provinces, but excluded any overt challenge to British rule.
3.  The "safety valve" theory, proposing that the Congress served as a means to channel popular discontent peacefully, accurately captures the sole motivation behind its establishment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a pivotal role in bringing together prominent Indian leaders and facilitating the formation of the Indian National Congress. His involvement, however, is not without complexity and has been interpreted differently by historians.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Congress initially adopted a moderate approach, its foundational goals included promoting national unity transcending caste, religious, and provincial divisions.  However, it's crucial to note that the initial approach was not an outright challenge to British rule, but rather an attempt to work within the existing system for reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "safety valve" theory, while partially true in explaining some of the British motivations in supporting the Congress's formation, is an oversimplification. It fails to account for the genuine nationalist aspirations of Indian leaders who actively participated in creating the organization. The Congress represented a growing desire for self-governance and political advancement among politically conscious Indians.  The desire for a unified national voice to address grievances was a key factor in its creation.


**3.  With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  While both Gandhi and Bose advocated for socialism in India, their approaches differed significantly regarding the role of industrialization.
2.  Bose's pragmatic approach led him to seek alliances with the Axis powers during World War II, regardless of their ideologies, to achieve Indian independence.
3.  Gandhi's unwavering adherence to non-violence as a means to achieve political goals contrasted sharply with Bose's belief in the potential efficacy of violent resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Both Gandhi and Bose were sympathetic to socialist ideals, but their interpretations differed substantially. Gandhi was wary of large-scale industrialization, advocating for a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose believed industrialization was crucial for India's economic and political progress.

Statement 2 is correct.  Bose's approach to securing Indian independence was significantly more pragmatic than Gandhi's.  He famously sought alliances with the Axis powers, including Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, believing that exploiting the weaknesses of the British Empire during World War II offered a crucial opportunity to gain freedom.  This decision remains a controversial aspect of Bose's legacy.

Statement 3 is also correct. The fundamental difference between Gandhi and Bose lies in their approach to achieving independence. Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha and unwavering commitment to non-violence guided his political strategy. In contrast, Bose, while acknowledging the effectiveness of Gandhi's methods, believed that violent resistance might be necessary to overthrow British rule, especially considering the international context of World War II.


**4. With reference to the Cripps Mission (1942), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission proposed the immediate transfer of substantial power to an interim Indian government, with complete independence following the conclusion of World War II.
2.  The option for provinces to secede from the proposed Indian Union was a key element of the Cripps proposals, paving the way for the partition of India.
3.  The Congress's rejection of the Cripps proposals stemmed primarily from its disagreement with the inclusion of princely states in the proposed Indian federation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did not propose the immediate transfer of substantial power. While it offered Dominion status after the war, the immediate transfer of power was not a part of the deal. The Governor-General's powers remained largely intact during the war period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cripps proposals included an option for provinces to opt out of the proposed Indian Union and forge their own agreements with Britain. This provision, though intended to address the concerns of certain regions and communities, proved to be a significant factor in the eventual partition of India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Congress had some reservations about the representation of princely states, the primary reasons for rejecting the Cripps proposals were the offer of Dominion status instead of complete independence, the right of provinces to secede, and the lack of any immediate transfer of power.  The retention of the Governor-General’s significant powers also fueled the Congress's opposition.


**5. With reference to the post-1857 British policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British implemented a policy of "divide and rule" by exacerbating existing religious and caste tensions to prevent a united challenge to their authority.
2.  The British administration actively promoted social reforms that challenged traditional social hierarchies, leading to widespread support among progressive sections of Indian society.
3.  The introduction of the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems of land revenue ensured equitable distribution of land ownership and improved the economic condition of the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The British administration, particularly after the 1857 revolt, consciously employed a "divide and rule" strategy. They exploited existing social and religious divisions among Indians – Hindus and Muslims, different castes, and regional groups – to weaken the potential for a unified nationalist movement against their rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British administration's attitude towards social reforms was not consistent. While initially supporting some reforms, they later retreated from this stance, fearing the opposition of orthodox sections of society.  Their support for social reforms was often opportunistic, aiming to weaken the nationalist movement rather than genuinely uplift Indian society.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The various land revenue systems introduced by the British – Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari – were not designed to ensure equitable land ownership.  Instead, they often led to increased exploitation of the peasantry, widespread indebtedness, and concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few. These systems significantly contributed to the impoverishment of many rural communities and fuelled widespread discontent.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at "difficult," requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills to avoid plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for a solely Gandhian approach to constructive work, rejecting any engagement in constitutional politics.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru championed the immediate resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle, criticizing both constructive work and electoral participation as reformist deviations.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance in provincial legislatures but later conceded, allowing Congress participation in elections while cautioning against being "sucked into constitutionalism."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ansari, Ali, and Desai advocated for constitutional struggle and participation in elections, not solely a Gandhian approach focused on constructive work. Their strategy aimed at maintaining political momentum and building Congress strength during a period of non-mass struggle.

Statement 2 is correct. Nehru strongly opposed the post-CDM strategy of focusing on constructive work and council entry. He viewed these as a retreat from revolutionary action and advocated for the continuation of non-constitutional mass struggle to address the core issue of colonialism and the prevailing economic crisis.  His socialist vision emphasized class struggle as integral to anti-imperialist action.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's initial reluctance to accept office stemmed from his belief that parliamentary politics alone could not achieve freedom. However, he eventually allowed Congress participation in the 1937 provincial elections, albeit with the caveat that this should not lead to a compromise with imperialism or a shift toward purely constitutional methods.  His approach aimed at balancing different factions within the Congress.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully functioning All-India Federation immediately upon its passage, incorporating all British Indian provinces and princely states.
2.  Provincial autonomy replaced dyarchy, granting provinces significant self-governance but retaining certain "special responsibilities" for the governor.
3. The Act significantly expanded the franchise, but retained the system of communal electorates, which contributed to later political divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proposed All-India Federation under the Act never materialized due to the failure to meet the conditions for princely state participation.  The central government continued to operate under the provisions of the 1919 Act until 1946.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did indeed replace dyarchy with provincial autonomy, granting provinces greater self-governance. However, it also included "special responsibilities" for the governor, allowing him to intervene in matters concerning minorities, law and order, and British interests, thus limiting the extent of provincial autonomy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act broadened the franchise, significantly increasing the number of eligible voters. However, it continued the controversial system of communal electorates, granting separate electorates to various religious and social groups, which exacerbated communal tensions and ultimately contributed to the partition of India.


**3. With reference to the first general elections in independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The elections were conducted under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which detailed provisions for voter registration, constituency demarcation, and the conduct of polls.
2.  The Indian National Congress secured a commanding majority in both the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, forming governments across most of India.
3.  Despite the largely illiterate electorate, the voter turnout was remarkably high, exceeding 70%, and the number of invalid votes was negligible.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Representation of the People Act, 1951, did deal with many aspects of the electoral process, the 1950 Act was crucial for establishing voter qualifications and electoral rolls.  Both Acts were essential for the elections.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian National Congress achieved a landslide victory in the 1952 general elections, securing a substantial majority in the Lok Sabha and forming governments in virtually all states. This dominance reflected the Congress's legacy as the leading force in the independence movement and its broad appeal across the Indian population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The voter turnout in the first general elections was approximately 45.7%, not exceeding 70%. While this was considered significant for a newly independent nation with a largely illiterate population, it was not as high as stated. The percentage of invalid votes was also low (around 3-4%) but not negligible.


**4. With reference to the challenges faced by independent India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate challenges included the integration of princely states, the rehabilitation of refugees from partition, and the suppression of communist insurgencies.
2.  The medium-term challenges focused primarily on the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of a stable political order through democratic elections.
3. The long-term challenges centered on economic development, poverty alleviation, and the maintenance of national unity amidst diverse linguistic and religious groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the multifaceted challenges faced by newly independent India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the immediate post-partition issues of integrating princely states, managing massive refugee flows, and addressing the threat of communist insurgencies, particularly in regions like Telangana.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the crucial tasks of constitution-making and establishing a stable democratic political system.  Statement 3 correctly points to the long-term goals of economic progress, poverty reduction, and maintaining national unity in a diverse nation.  These three categories of challenges, while distinct in timeframe, were all intertwined and crucial to the success of independent India.


**5. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution, passed in Bombay in August 1942, demanded the immediate end of British rule in India as a necessity for both India's sake and the success of the Allied war effort.
2.  The movement was launched immediately after the passing of the resolution, with Gandhi leading mass protests across the country.
3. The movement resulted in widespread violence and the establishment of parallel governments in several parts of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Resolution, passed in August 1942, unequivocally called for the immediate end of British rule, linking India's freedom to the success of the Allied war effort. It highlighted the moral imperative of Indian independence and its potential contribution to the global fight against fascism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The movement was not launched immediately after the resolution's passage.  The government swiftly arrested Gandhi and other key Congress leaders, preventing a coordinated nationwide launch.  The resulting movement was largely spontaneous and leaderless.

Statement 3 is correct. Though initially planned as a non-violent movement, the arrests of leaders led to widespread spontaneous protests and violent clashes with authorities.  In many areas, the absence of central leadership led to the formation of localized, parallel governments, reflecting the intensity of the people's desire for independence.  The movement demonstrated the deep-seated nationalist sentiment and capacity for widespread resistance.


**1. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in Princely States during British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  Excessive land revenue and unbearable taxation were widespread, hindering education and social services.
2.  Serfdom and forced labor were prevalent in several princely states, despite the presence of a corrupt and decadent ruler.
3.  The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, aimed to promote national unity and counter the rising national movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that appalling economic, political, and social conditions prevailed in most princely states, characterized by excessive and unbearable land revenue and taxation, retarded education, and extremely backward health and social services.  This directly supports the assertion of widespread economic hardship and its impact on social development.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text clearly mentions the existence of serfdom, slavery, and forced labor flourishing in several states. While it notes that a corrupt ruler was sometimes checked by internal revolt or external aggression, the British rule removed these checks, exacerbating these exploitative practices.  This highlights the unchecked nature of these practices under British indirect rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921 under British guidance, was designed to enable the princes to discuss matters of common interest.  However, the passage explicitly states that the British authorities used the princes to *prevent* the growth of national unity and to counter the rising national movement. The Chamber served the British interest in maintaining the status quo rather than fostering Indian unity.  This directly contradicts the statement's claim.  The British used the princes to divide and rule, not to unite.


**2. With reference to the political response to British rule in Princely States, consider the following statements:**

1. The All-India States’ Peoples’ Conference, founded in 1927, coordinated political activities in various princely states, advocating for democratic rights and popular governments.
2.  The second Non-Cooperation Movement significantly impacted the people of princely states, stimulating political activity and popular struggles, particularly in states like Rajkot, Jaipur, Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Travancore.
3. The Nizam of Hyderabad, Maharaja of Kashmir, and Maharaja of Travancore all supported the popular movements for democratic rights and popular governments, viewing them as essential for national unity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the founding of the All-India States’ Peoples’ Conference in December 1927 to coordinate political activities in the different princely states and their advocacy for democratic rights and popular governments. This directly supports the statement's claim regarding the Conference's role and objectives.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly states that the second Non-Cooperation Movement deeply impacted the people of the princely states, leading to increased political activity and popular struggles in several key states, including Rajkot, Jaipur, Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Travancore. This directly corroborates the statement's assertion about the movement's impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the rulers of Hyderabad, Kashmir, and Travancore *opposed* the popular movements, employing communalist rhetoric to counter them.  The Nizam of Hyderabad framed the agitation as anti-Muslim, the Maharaja of Kashmir labeled it anti-Hindu, and the Maharaja of Travancore claimed that Christians were behind it.  This directly refutes the statement's claim of their support for the movements. Their actions were aimed at suppressing, not supporting, the democratic aspirations of their subjects.


**3. With reference to the growth of communalism in India during the pre-independence era, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress's failure to win many seats reserved for minorities in legislative assemblies, particularly Muslim seats, fueled the Muslim League's opposition and the propagation of the two-nation theory.
2. The Hindu Mahasabha's acceptance of the two-nation theory and opposition to safeguards for minorities further exacerbated communal tensions.
3. The Muslim League's strength was primarily concentrated in areas where Muslims were in a majority, such as the North-Western Frontier Province, Punjab, Sindh, and Bengal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights the Congress's poor performance in seats reserved for minorities, winning only 26 out of 482 Muslim-reserved seats. This electoral outcome contributed significantly to the Muslim League's growing opposition to the Congress and the escalation of communal rhetoric, including the propagation of the divisive two-nation theory. The limited success of the Congress in winning minority seats fueled the Muslim League's narrative of minority vulnerability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage explicitly states that the Hindu Mahasabha, mirroring the Muslim League's actions, also adopted the two-nation theory and actively opposed measures designed to protect minority rights. This mutual reinforcement of communal ideologies further deepened the existing divisions and contributed to the escalation of communal tensions.  The Hindu Mahasabha’s stance directly fueled the communal divide.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly contradicts this statement. It clarifies that the Muslim League was stronger in areas where Muslims were in a *minority*, where they felt a greater sense of insecurity and vulnerability.  In areas where Muslims were in a majority, the League remained relatively weak, suggesting that the perception of threat played a crucial role in the League's regional strength. The passage directly establishes a correlation between minority status and the Muslim League's strength.


**4. With reference to the impact of the Second World War on the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress, while sympathetic to the victims of Fascist aggression,  demanded India's freedom or effective power in Indian hands before actively participating in the war effort.
2. The Cripps Mission, sent to India in 1942, successfully negotiated an agreement with the Congress leaders, securing their active cooperation in the war effort.
3.  The Japanese advance into Burma in 1942 brought the war to India's doorstep, prompting the British to seek increased cooperation from Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly details the Congress's position: while supporting the fight against Fascism, they argued that an enslaved nation could not credibly aid others in their struggle for freedom.  This led to their demand for Indian independence or at least effective Indian control before active participation in the war. The passage directly supports this nuanced stance of the Congress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that despite Sir Stafford Cripps's declaration of aiming for self-government in India, the detailed negotiations between him and the Congress leaders ultimately broke down, failing to secure their cooperation. The mission's failure is a key point in understanding the evolving dynamics of the relationship between the British and the Congress.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage highlights the Japanese occupation of Rangoon in March 1942, bringing the war to India's borders. This strategic development significantly increased the British government's urgency to secure the active cooperation of Indians in the war effort, as their vulnerability increased dramatically.  The Japanese advance directly impacted British strategy.


**5.  With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists, primarily described as Moderates, employed constitutional agitation and advocated for slow, orderly political progress through petitions, meetings, and resolutions.
2.  All early nationalists believed that continued political connection with Britain was in India's interest, aiming to transform British rule into a form approximating national rule rather than seeking immediate expulsion of the British.
3.  The early nationalist movement had deep roots among the masses, successfully achieving many reforms through their agitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately describes the methods of the Moderate nationalists, emphasizing their reliance on constitutional agitation within the legal framework, aiming for gradual, orderly progress through petitions, meetings, resolutions, and speeches. This accurately reflects their political strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many Moderate leaders professed loyalty to British rule, believing continued connection was beneficial at that historical juncture, the passage also notes the existence of other nationalists who had no faith in British intentions from the outset and advocated for a more assertive political and economic program.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the diverse views within the early nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage acknowledges criticism of the early nationalist movement for lacking deep roots among the masses and for achieving few concrete reforms. While it credits the movement with creating a national awakening and promoting nationalist ideas, it does not support the claim of widespread mass support or significant immediate success in achieving reforms.  The passage's evaluation of the early movement's achievements is more nuanced and critical.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gandhi's philosophy:**

1. Gandhi's philosophy emphasized the inseparability of belief and action, advocating for the practical application of truth and non-violence in daily life.
2.  Gandhi's concept of Satyagraha involved a hierarchical approach, with picketing as the final and most impactful step in the process.
3. Gandhi's philosophy significantly influenced the socio-economic reforms undertaken in India, particularly concerning the upliftment of untouchables and the promotion of cottage industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Gandhi consistently stressed the importance of aligning one's actions with one's beliefs. His advocacy of truth and non-violence wasn't merely rhetorical; it was a call for a fundamental shift in how individuals lived their lives and interacted with the world. This is reflected in his emphasis on constructive programmes and his personal commitment to simple living.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Satyagraha, while employing various methods like boycott, picketing, and strikes, did not have a rigid, hierarchical structure. The choice of method depended on the specific context and circumstances of the struggle.  The final step was often determined by the response of the opposing party and the evolving dynamics of the resistance.  Fasting, for instance, was a powerful tool used at various stages, not necessarily reserved for the end.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's philosophy deeply impacted India's socio-economic landscape. His efforts to improve the status of untouchables are well-documented, and he strongly advocated for the development of village industries (khadi) as a means of economic self-reliance and empowerment, particularly for the rural poor.  His ideas continue to resonate in discussions of social justice and sustainable development.


**2. With reference to Gandhian principles, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhian economics prioritized decentralization, viewing centralization as a source of exploitation and inequality.
2.  According to Gandhian principles, the ultimate aim of a Satyagrahi is to achieve a moral victory, not necessarily the defeat of the opponent.
3.  Gandhi's political philosophy advocated for religion-based politics, believing that religious values were essential for public welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi was a staunch critic of centralized economic systems, believing they led to exploitation and inequality. He championed decentralized, village-based economies built on self-sufficiency and simple living, emphasizing the dignity of labour and the importance of cottage industries.  This is evident in his promotion of Khadi and his critique of industrialization's negative social impacts.

Statement 2 is correct. While Satyagraha aimed to bring about change, the focus was primarily on moral persuasion and the transformation of hearts and minds.  The goal was not merely to defeat an opponent but to achieve a moral victory, based on truth and non-violence, even if it meant accepting personal suffering.  The emphasis was on the means as much as the end.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gandhi's political philosophy, while rooted in his religious beliefs, did not advocate for religion-based politics in the sense of establishing a theocracy.  He believed in the importance of ethical principles and religious values in public life but sought a secular framework for governance where people of all faiths could coexist peacefully and participate equally.  He argued for a synthesis of religion and politics, not a conflation of the two.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Rowlatt Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, significantly curtailed civil liberties in India, allowing for detention without trial and suppression of dissent.
2. Gandhi's response to the Rowlatt Act involved launching a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience, marking a shift towards mass-based political action.
3. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a direct consequence of the Rowlatt Act protests, resulted in widespread condemnation of the British government's actions but did not significantly alter the course of the nationalist movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Rowlatt Act was a deeply repressive piece of legislation that authorized the detention of individuals without trial, effectively suspending basic civil liberties.  It was seen as a betrayal of Indian aspirations for self-governance, further fueling nationalist sentiment.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rowlatt Act prompted Gandhi to launch a campaign of nationwide civil disobedience, a significant departure from the earlier, more moderate forms of political activism.  This marked a turning point, mobilizing mass participation in the nationalist movement and demonstrating the power of non-violent resistance on a large scale.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a brutal act of state violence against unarmed civilians protesting the Rowlatt Act, had a profound impact on the nationalist movement.  The outrage it generated intensified anti-British sentiment and significantly shifted the trajectory of the struggle for independence, accelerating the move towards more assertive and radical forms of resistance.  The massacre is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the Indian freedom struggle.


**4.  With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, comprising both British Indian provinces and princely states, with a bicameral legislature at the center.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance to the provinces, though with safeguards and special powers reserved for the governor.
3. The Act granted universal adult suffrage to all Indian citizens, thereby ensuring complete political participation in the newly formed legislative bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, envisioned the creation of an All-India Federation, bringing together British Indian provinces and princely states under a federal structure. A bicameral legislature was established at the center, although the princely states held disproportionate power.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act introduced a system of provincial autonomy, transferring significant administrative powers to the elected provincial governments. However, the Act also included crucial safeguards and special powers for the governor, enabling them to intervene in various matters, including law and order, and protect British interests.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act did not introduce universal adult suffrage.  Instead, it extended the franchise to a limited segment of the population. The system of communal electorates was also maintained, perpetuating divisions within Indian society.  The limited franchise was a significant point of contention for the Indian National Congress.


**5. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution, passed in August 1942, demanded the immediate end of British rule in India.
2. The movement was launched immediately after the passing of the resolution, leading to widespread non-violent protests across the country.
3.  The movement's leadership remained largely intact throughout its duration, ensuring coordinated and effective mass action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Quit India Resolution, passed by the All India Congress Committee in August 1942, unequivocally demanded the immediate end of British rule in India.  The resolution highlighted the urgency of independence, both for India's own sake and for the success of the Allied war effort against fascism.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the resolution called for a mass movement, the launch was swiftly followed by the arrest of key Congress leaders, including Gandhi. This left the movement leaderless and resulted in spontaneous, often violent, protests across the country. The movement's initial non-violent character was significantly disrupted by the arrests and subsequent police repression.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The arrests of top Congress leaders severely hampered the movement's coordination and organization.  The absence of established leadership resulted in decentralized and often unplanned actions, contributing to the violent turn the movement took in many areas. The movement lacked the unified and centrally directed structure that characterized earlier Gandhian campaigns.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects related to the historical context of the provided text.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Sayyid Ahmad Khan's contributions:**

1. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's educational philosophy emphasized the immediate adoption of a dynamic political outlook to challenge British rule.
2.  The Aligarh School, associated with Sayyid Ahmad Khan, included figures like Chiragh Ali and Altaf Husain Hali.
3. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist zeal solely focused on religious matters, neglecting social issues such as women's status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Sayyid Ahmad Khan, while believing in modernization, advocated for a period of aloofness from direct political confrontation with the British, prioritizing educational reform as a prerequisite for effective political action. He believed that Indians needed to become modern in their thinking before challenging British rule successfully.

Statement 2 is correct.  Chiragh Ali and Altaf Husain Hali were indeed prominent members of the Aligarh School, a group of loyal followers who contributed significantly to Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist movement.  The Aligarh School played a vital role in promoting education and social reform within the Muslim community.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sayyid Ahmad Khan's reformist zeal encompassed both religious and social spheres. He actively advocated for raising the status of women in Muslim society, promoting education for women, and condemning practices like polygamy and easy divorce.  His work extended beyond religious reform to address broader social issues.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**2. With reference to the impact of Western culture on 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Rammohun Roy's philosophy was strictly rooted in Western thought, rejecting traditional Indian philosophical systems.
2. The new social groups emerging in 19th-century India—the capitalist class, the working class, and the modern intelligentsia—universally resisted modernisation.
3. Rammohun Roy's work, "Gift to Monotheists," argued for the worship of a single God, drawing upon both Eastern and Western philosophical arguments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rammohun Roy's philosophy was a unique synthesis of Eastern and Western thought. While he admired the rationality and scientific approach of the West, he held deep respect for traditional Indian philosophical systems, particularly Vedanta. His approach was not a complete rejection of the East but a selective integration of its best aspects with modern Western ideas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The emergence of new social groups in 19th-century India did not lead to universal resistance to modernisation. While some sections clung to traditional ways, many within the capitalist class, the working class, and the modern intelligentsia actively sought modernisation to advance their interests and aspirations.  The desire for modernisation was not uniform but a complex and multifaceted process.

Statement 3 is correct.  Rammohun Roy's "Gift to Monotheists" indeed presented arguments for monotheism, drawing upon both the ancient scriptures of India and the rationalistic arguments of the West. This reflects his unique approach to reform, integrating Eastern and Western perspectives.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderate nationalists unanimously advocated for the immediate expulsion of the British from India.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's efforts in Britain focused solely on educating British public opinion, neglecting the cultivation of Indian public opinion.
3. The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak marked a significant turning point, galvanizing the nationalist movement and expanding his influence beyond Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Moderate nationalists, while advocating for self-governance, did not initially call for the immediate expulsion of the British. Their approach was gradual and constitutional, aiming to reform British rule from within rather than through outright expulsion.  Their belief in the possibility of reforming British rule to approximate national rule was a defining characteristic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's efforts were crucial in educating both British and Indian public opinion. While he spent considerable time in Britain advocating for India's cause, his influence extended to India through his writings, speeches, and political activism. His work was a two-pronged approach aimed at influencing both audiences.

Statement 3 is correct.  Tilak's arrest in 1897 did indeed galvanize the nationalist movement and significantly increased his all-India stature.  Previously known mainly in Maharashtra, his imprisonment transformed him into a national leader, mobilizing widespread opposition to the government's actions. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**4. With reference to the British educational policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wood's Despatch of 1854 advocated for the exclusive use of English as the medium of instruction at all levels of education.
2. The Hunter Commission of 1882 primarily focused on higher education, neglecting primary and secondary education.
3. The establishment of universities at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras in 1857 was a direct outcome of the Wood's Despatch of 1854.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Wood's Despatch emphasized English for higher education, it also recommended the use of vernacular languages at the primary and secondary levels.  The despatch aimed for a balanced approach, recognizing the importance of both English and vernacular languages in the educational system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission of 1882 specifically focused on the shortcomings of primary and secondary education, highlighting the need for improvements and expansion.  Its recommendations were primarily aimed at addressing the deficiencies in these crucial levels of the education system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the universities at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were established shortly after the Wood's Despatch, the despatch itself did not directly cause their immediate establishment.  The universities' establishment was a gradual process, influenced by the despatch's recommendations but also by other factors, including the need to provide educated personnel for the administration.  Therefore, none of the statements are completely accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the British revenue policies in India:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis, aimed to empower the ryots (cultivators) by granting them direct ownership of land.
2. The Ryotwari system, primarily implemented in the Madras Presidency, involved collecting land revenue directly from individual cultivators without intermediaries.
3. The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of northern India, treated the village community as the collective owner of the land, with revenue collected from individual cultivators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement granted proprietary rights to the zamindars (landlords), not the ryots. This led to the exploitation of ryots by zamindars, who were primarily interested in maximizing their profits. The system did not improve the condition of the cultivators.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ryotwari system indeed involved collecting land revenue directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars. This was intended to increase government revenue and minimize corruption, although it often resulted in over-assessment and exploitation of the ryots.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The Mahalwari system did treat the village community as a unit for revenue assessment. However, the revenue was ultimately collected from individual cultivators within the village community, not from the community as a whole. Thus, the statement is partially misleading.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely correct, although statement 3 needs clarification.


**6. With reference to post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru vehemently opposed the entry of Congressmen into legislative councils, advocating for a solely non-constitutional approach to achieving independence.
2. The Government of India Act of 1935 established an All-India Federation that included all princely states from its inception.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance by the Congress but later relented, allowing for Congress participation in provincial governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nehru was critical of solely relying on constitutional methods and advocated for a more radical approach, he did not completely oppose Congress participation in legislative councils. His position was nuanced, recognizing the potential for both constructive and disruptive engagement within the existing political framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The All-India Federation proposed under the Government of India Act of 1935 never materialized due to the non-participation of many princely states. The Act's provisions for federation remained largely unimplemented.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi initially expressed reservations about office acceptance but eventually changed his stance, allowing the Congress to participate in provincial governments following the 1937 elections.  This decision reflected a strategic shift within the Congress, balancing mass movements with participation in existing political structures. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.

**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1858-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists primarily employed constitutional agitation, working within the legal framework, to achieve gradual political progress.
2.  Their political strategy involved building public opinion in India and simultaneously educating British public opinion about Indian grievances.
3.  All early nationalists shared a uniform belief in the eventual expulsion of the British from India, advocating for complete independence from the outset.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," focused on constitutional methods like petitions, meetings, and resolutions to gradually influence the British government.  They operated within the existing legal framework, believing in slow, orderly progress.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Their approach was two-pronged:  building domestic public opinion to raise political consciousness and national spirit within India, and simultaneously lobbying the British government and public through deputations and publications to advocate for Indian interests and reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the ultimate goal of self-government or Swaraj evolved over time, not all early nationalists initially aimed for the immediate expulsion of the British. Many believed in a gradual transformation of British rule into a system more responsive to Indian needs, maintaining a political connection with Britain, at least initially, believing it to be in India's best interest at that historical juncture.  The shift towards complete independence was a gradual process.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement's response to British policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The nationalists vehemently opposed the Ilbert Bill, viewing it as an attempt to undermine the judicial authority of British officials.
2.  The nationalists strongly supported the Vernacular Press Act, believing it to be a necessary measure for maintaining social order.
3.  Nationalist leaders consistently advocated for the increased Indianisation of higher administrative services, citing economic, political, and moral reasons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The nationalists actually *supported* the Ilbert Bill, which aimed to allow Indian judges to try European citizens in criminal cases.  The opposition came from the European community in India, highlighting the existing racial discrimination within the judicial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The nationalists strongly *opposed* the Vernacular Press Act, seeing it as a tool to suppress criticism of the British government and curtail freedom of speech. This act restricted the Indian-language press, which was crucial in disseminating nationalist ideas.

Statement 3 is correct.  Nationalists consistently argued for greater Indian representation in higher administrative positions, emphasizing economic efficiency (lower salaries for Indian officials), political responsiveness (a government more attuned to Indian needs), and moral arguments (ending the sense of racial inferiority among Indians).  Gopal Krishna Gokhale eloquently articulated the moral aspects of this demand.


**3. With reference to the methods and goals of the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists' demand for Swaraj initially implied complete independence from British rule.
2.  The Swadeshi movement aimed to promote Indian industries by boycotting British goods and advocating for the use of Indian-made products.
3.  The early nationalists' approach to economic reform primarily focused on dismantling the existing zamindari system and redistributing land to the peasantry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early nationalists' initial articulation of Swaraj did not necessarily mean complete independence.  It often referred to self-government within the British Empire, similar to the dominion status enjoyed by some other colonies.  The demand for complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) emerged later in the movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a key component of the early nationalist economic strategy, focused on promoting Indian industries through boycotts of British goods and the use of domestically produced alternatives.  This was seen as a way to improve the Indian economy and reduce reliance on Britain.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the early nationalists did criticize the zamindari system and advocate for peasant welfare, their primary economic focus was not on immediate land redistribution.  Their efforts were more on promoting Indian industries, reducing the economic drain to Britain, and advocating for fairer taxation policies.  Land reform became a more prominent issue in later phases of the nationalist movement.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the pre-Congress nationalist organizations:**

1. The British India Association primarily focused on advocating for the interests of Bengal's landlords.
2. The Indian Association, founded in Calcutta, played a significant role in mobilizing public opinion and unifying Indians across provincial lines on a shared political platform.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association, based in London, primarily focused on promoting industrialization in India through government support.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the British India Association did address broader public interests, its initial focus and membership were heavily weighted towards the interests of the Bengal landowning class.  It evolved to address broader issues, but its origins were firmly rooted in landlord concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Association, led by figures like Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, was instrumental in creating a broader national consciousness and uniting Indians across different provinces around common political goals.  Its low membership fees aimed to include a wider segment of the population.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association did advocate for India's economic interests, its primary focus was not on promoting industrialization through direct government support.  Naoroji's work emphasized exposing the economic drain of British rule on India and advocating for fairer economic policies.  His focus was on overall economic justice and highlighting British exploitation.


**5. With reference to the impact of the rediscovery of India’s past on the nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rediscovery of India's past solely focused on glorifying ancient India, neglecting the achievements of the medieval period.
2.  This rediscovery played a crucial role in countering British narratives that portrayed India as inherently incapable of self-governance.
3.  The uncritical glorification of India’s past fostered a sense of national unity, transcending religious and regional differences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there was a tendency to emphasize ancient India's achievements, the rediscovery of the past was not solely focused on that period.  The work of scholars also brought to light the contributions of the medieval period, although this aspect was sometimes overshadowed by the focus on antiquity.

Statement 2 is correct. The rediscovery of India's rich cultural and historical heritage served to counter the British narrative that depicted Indians as inherently incapable of self-rule and possessing a backward culture.  Highlighting India's past achievements in various fields helped to foster self-confidence and national pride among Indians.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the rediscovery of the past contributed to a sense of national identity, the uncritical glorification of the past also inadvertently exacerbated communal tensions.  The selective focus on certain periods of history and the neglect of others led to the development of separate narratives among different religious groups, particularly Hindus and Muslims, hindering the creation of a truly unified national identity that transcended religious differences.  The selective appropriation of historical narratives contributed to communal divisions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of the early Indian National Congress and the nationalist movement.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level with plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the early Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INC's foundation in 1885 marked the first organized, all-India expression of the nationalist movement, preceding numerous smaller, regional associations.
2.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the INC's formation, primarily motivated by a desire to act as a "safety valve" for growing Indian discontent.
3.  Early INC leaders, while advocating for greater Indian participation in governance, primarily employed constitutional methods and avoided direct challenges to British rule, hoping for gradual progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INC's establishment in 1885 was indeed a significant milestone, unifying various pre-existing regional movements under a single national banner.  However, it built upon the groundwork laid by numerous smaller organizations and conferences, such as the Indian Association and the Indian National Conference.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While A.O. Hume was instrumental in the INC's founding, the "safety valve" theory, while a contributing factor in some interpretations, doesn't fully capture the complexities of Hume's motivations or the nationalist aspirations driving Indian participation.  The INC represented a genuine desire for self-governance and national advancement, even if it initially pursued constitutional means.

Statement 3 is correct. The early INC, characterized by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, adopted a moderate approach, focusing on constitutional reforms and petitions rather than direct confrontation with British authority. This strategy reflected a calculated approach to avoid immediate suppression of their movement and to build support for gradual reforms.  Their methods included working within the existing legislative councils to advocate for increased Indian representation and influence.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement's economic critique of British rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "drain of wealth" theory, popularized by Dadabhai Naoroji, argued that British policies systematically transferred India's resources to Britain, contributing to India's impoverishment.
2.  Early nationalists advocated exclusively for complete protectionist policies, demanding complete severance of all economic ties with Britain to foster indigenous industries.
3.  The Swadeshi movement, although primarily focused on promoting Indian-made goods, also had a significant political dimension, symbolizing resistance to British economic control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory was a cornerstone of the early nationalists' economic critique.  It meticulously documented how British policies, such as high taxation, unequal trade practices, and the remittance of profits back to Britain, led to a systematic transfer of India's wealth, hindering its economic development and contributing to widespread poverty.  This analysis formed a crucial basis for the nationalist movement's demands for economic reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While early nationalists strongly advocated for the development of Indian industries and reduced dependence on British goods, the approach wasn't exclusively protectionist.  Their demands included a mix of strategies such as tariff protection, government aid for industries, and the promotion of Swadeshi (use of Indian goods).  Complete severance of all economic ties with Britain was not a universally held position.

Statement 3 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, while promoting the use of Indian goods and supporting indigenous industries, also held a powerful political significance. It represented a form of economic resistance to British control, symbolizing national self-reliance and challenging the exploitative nature of colonial economic policies.  The movement's success in mobilizing public support demonstrated the effective linkage between economic and political aspects of the nationalist struggle.


**3. With reference to the aims and objectives of the early Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The INC aimed to create a unified national identity, transcending religious, caste, and regional differences, to present a united front against British rule.
2.  The INC initially focused solely on achieving complete independence ("Purna Swaraj") as its primary goal, rejecting any form of compromise or gradualist approach.
3. The INC sought to utilize existing legislative councils to advocate for reforms, recognizing them as potential avenues for influencing British policy and gaining a greater share in governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A central aim of the early INC was to foster a sense of national unity and identity among diverse Indian populations.  This involved promoting a shared political vision and goals that transcended religious, caste, and regional divisions.  The INC's annual sessions in different parts of the country and its inclusive membership reflected this strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The early INC did not initially advocate for "Purna Swaraj" (complete independence).  Instead, it adopted a more gradualist approach, initially focusing on securing greater Indian participation in governance through constitutional means and advocating for reforms within the existing system. The demand for complete independence emerged later in the movement.

Statement 3 is correct.  The early INC did utilize existing legislative councils as platforms to advocate for reforms and greater Indian representation.  While not abandoning the goal of self-governance, the INC recognized the importance of working within the existing political structures to achieve incremental gains and influence British policy.  This pragmatic approach was a key characteristic of the early Congress strategy.


**4. With reference to the "Moderates" within the early Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderates, such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, believed in achieving self-governance through gradual constitutional means, emphasizing loyalty to the British Crown.
2.  The Moderates' approach involved solely focusing on peaceful petitions and appeals to the British government, rejecting any form of agitation or public protest.
3.  The Moderates' economic critique of British rule included exposing the "drain of wealth" and advocating for the development of Indian industries through measures like tariff protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Moderates were indeed committed to achieving self-governance, but through a gradual and constitutional approach.  While they did not advocate for immediate independence, their loyalty to the Crown was conditional; it was contingent upon the British government's willingness to introduce meaningful reforms that addressed Indian grievances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Moderates’ approach was not limited to peaceful petitions.  While they emphasized constitutional methods, their strategies also included public meetings, resolutions, and organized campaigns to raise public awareness and pressure the British government.  Their actions were designed to raise public awareness and create political pressure.

Statement 3 is correct. The Moderates conducted a detailed critique of British economic policies.  This included exposing the "drain of wealth" and advocating for the development of Indian industries through measures such as tariff protection and government support. They argued that British economic policies were systematically impoverishing India and hindering its economic progress.  Their work laid the foundation for later nationalist economic policies.


**5. With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British India Association, formed through the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily represented the interests of wealthy landowners and focused on administrative reforms.
2. The Indian Association, founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose, advocated for broader public interests beyond the concerns of the elite, including issues related to tenants' rights and workers' conditions.
3.  All pre-Congress organizations were strictly provincial in scope and failed to establish any all-India coordination or collaborative efforts before the formation of the INC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British India Association, a product of the merger of two earlier organizations, primarily represented the interests of the wealthy and influential landed gentry.  While it did advocate for administrative reforms, its focus remained largely on issues affecting the elite classes.  Its influence was also largely confined to Bengal.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Association, in contrast to the British India Association, broadened the scope of nationalist activism.  It championed the rights of tenants and workers, extending its concerns beyond the elite, and actively engaged in public campaigns on a range of issues.  This broader approach is a key difference between it and the British India Association.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many pre-Congress organizations were primarily regional in their influence, they did engage in some forms of all-India coordination and collaborative efforts.  The Indian Association, for instance, organized the first all-India National Conference in 1883, demonstrating a move toward broader national collaboration before the INC's formation.  This early attempt at all-India coordination laid the groundwork for the future INC.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission proposed the immediate transfer of effective power to Indians, a key Congress demand.
2. The breakdown of negotiations between Cripps and Congress leaders stemmed primarily from disagreements over the future status of princely states.
3. The failure of the Cripps Mission directly led to the Congress passing the "Quit India" Resolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission explicitly *rejected* the Congress demand for the immediate transfer of power, offering instead a plan for dominion status after the war. This fundamental difference was a major point of contention.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the princely states were a factor in the broader Indian political landscape, the primary reason for the Cripps Mission's failure was the British refusal to immediately cede power to Indians, coupled with the Congress's dissatisfaction with promises of future self-governance while the Viceroy retained significant authority.  Disagreements over princely states were a secondary issue.

Statement 3 is correct. The failure of the Cripps Mission, demonstrating a lack of British willingness to meet Indian aspirations for independence, directly fueled the Congress's decision to launch a more assertive campaign for independence, culminating in the "Quit India" Resolution.  The resolution was a direct response to the perceived betrayal and deadlock created by the mission's failure.


**2. With reference to the "Quit India" Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Quit India" Resolution was passed by the All India Congress Committee in Calcutta in August 1942.
2.  Gandhi's "Do or Die" call directly incited widespread violence and significantly undermined the movement's non-violent nature.
3. The immediate arrest of top Congress leaders after the resolution's passage contributed to the movement's largely spontaneous and leaderless nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quit India" Resolution was passed in Bombay (Mumbai), not Calcutta.  The location is a crucial detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "Do or Die" call was indeed assertive, it did not directly incite widespread violence.  The movement's violent aspects were a complex outcome of several factors, including the arrests of leaders, pre-existing grievances, and the intense repression by the British.  To attribute the violence solely to Gandhi's call is an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is correct. The swift arrest of Gandhi and other key leaders following the resolution created a vacuum in leadership, leading to a largely spontaneous and decentralized nature of the protests.  This leaderless nature significantly shaped the movement's trajectory and intensity.


**3. With reference to the post-World War II Indian political scenario, consider the following statements:**

1. The Labour government's ascension to power in Britain in 1945 immediately led to the granting of complete independence to India.
2. The INA trials significantly contributed to the rise of widespread anti-British sentiment and mass movements across India.
3. The Wavell Plan successfully resolved the constitutional deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Labour government's arrival did shift the British stance towards greater Indian autonomy, but complete independence was not granted immediately.  A series of negotiations and events followed before independence was achieved.

Statement 2 is correct. The trials of INA officers, who were perceived as national heroes, galvanized widespread anti-British sentiment and fueled various mass movements, including protests, strikes, and ultimately, contributed to the pressure for independence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Wavell Plan, while an attempt at resolving the constitutional crisis, ultimately failed to achieve a lasting agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League, leaving the path to independence still fraught with complexities.  The plan's failure further exacerbated the political tensions.


**4. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Mission Plan explicitly endorsed the creation of Pakistan as a separate independent state.
2. The plan proposed a three-tier system of governance, involving provincial, sectional, and union levels.
3.  The plan's provisions regarding the grouping of provinces were interpreted differently by the Congress and the Muslim League, leading to further conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Mission Plan did *not* endorse the creation of Pakistan as a separate state. It proposed a framework for a united India with substantial autonomy for provinces, but the interpretation of the "grouping" clause proved to be a major point of contention.

Statement 2 is correct. The plan's core structure involved a three-tier system: provincial, sectional (grouping of provinces), and a union government at the center. This complex structure was intended to balance unity and autonomy.

Statement 3 is correct. The ambiguity surrounding the compulsory or optional nature of the grouping of provinces led to significantly different interpretations by the Congress and the Muslim League, ultimately contributing to the plan's failure and the escalation of the conflict leading to partition.  The differing interpretations highlight the inherent challenges in negotiating a solution acceptable to all parties.


**5. With reference to the Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1. Mohan Singh initiated the formation of the INA, primarily recruiting Indian soldiers who had surrendered to the Japanese.
2. Subhas Chandra Bose's leadership of the INA was instrumental in its military successes in the Imphal campaign.
3. The INA's activities significantly influenced the post-war political climate in India, contributing to increased pressure for independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mohan Singh, an Indian officer, took the initiative to form the INA initially, largely from Indian prisoners of war who had surrendered to the Japanese forces. His actions laid the groundwork for Bose's later involvement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bose's leadership boosted the INA's morale and international recognition, the Imphal campaign was ultimately a military defeat for the INA and the Japanese.  Attributing military success solely to Bose's leadership ignores the broader military context and limitations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The INA's activities, despite their military failure, had a profound impact on the post-war political landscape. The trials of INA officers and the widespread public support for their release significantly contributed to the growing pressure on the British to grant independence.  The symbolic significance of the INA's struggle resonated deeply with the Indian populace.


**1. With reference to British colonial policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British adopted a policy of "Divide and Rule" by exploiting existing religious and caste divisions, exacerbating conflicts over scarce resources like education and administrative jobs.
2.  The British initially supported social reforms but later withdrew their support, aligning themselves with conservative elements to maintain social stability and quell opposition to their rule.
3. The British consistently prioritized military expenditure over social services like education and healthcare, resulting in widespread underdevelopment of these sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of British colonial policy in India.  The "Divide and Rule" strategy is well-documented, with the British actively manipulating religious and caste differences to weaken any unified opposition to their rule.  This involved favoring certain groups over others, creating tensions, and diverting attention from the overarching issue of colonial oppression.  The manipulation of scarce resources like education and jobs further fueled these divisions.

The initial support for some social reforms, like the abolition of Sati, is also historically accurate. However, this support was often pragmatic and self-serving, designed to project a more progressive image.  As nationalist sentiment grew, the British shifted their stance, increasingly aligning with conservative social forces to suppress dissent. This strategic shift is crucial to understanding the complex interplay between British policy and Indian society.

Finally, the disproportionate emphasis on military spending at the expense of social development is undeniable.  A significant portion of India's revenue was consistently allocated to maintaining the army and suppressing rebellion, leaving limited resources for crucial social services. This neglect led to widespread underdevelopment in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which continues to have long-lasting consequences for India.  Therefore, all three statements are demonstrably correct.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars complete ownership rights over their land, leading to increased agricultural productivity and improved tenant conditions.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, ensuring equitable distribution of tax burden and preventing exploitation by intermediaries.
3. The Mahalwari System, adopted in parts of North India, assessed revenue collectively from village communities, promoting communal harmony and efficient revenue collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements accurately describe the outcomes of the British revenue systems.  The Permanent Settlement, while granting zamindars proprietary rights, did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or improved tenant conditions.  Instead, it led to widespread exploitation of peasants by absentee landlords and the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few.  The fixed revenue demand often exceeded the land's productive capacity, leading to impoverishment and widespread indebtedness among the peasantry.

The Ryotwari System, although aiming for direct collection from cultivators, did not ensure equitable distribution of the tax burden.  The assessment of land revenue was often inaccurate, leading to over-assessment and exploitation. The system also failed to prevent the emergence of exploitative intermediaries.

The Mahalwari System, while assessing revenue collectively, did not promote communal harmony or efficient revenue collection. The system often led to conflicts within village communities and inaccuracies in revenue assessment, resulting in exploitation and widespread indebtedness.  Each system, despite its intentions, resulted in significant negative consequences for the Indian peasantry and contributed to widespread rural poverty.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently promoted Western education and cultural values, leading to a rapid decline of traditional Indian culture and the widespread adoption of Western lifestyles.
2. The activities of Christian missionaries played a significant role in promoting Western education and social reforms, converting large sections of the Indian population to Christianity.
3. The British policy towards princely states involved complete subjugation of their sovereignty and the imposition of direct British rule, eliminating any semblance of autonomy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements accurately represent the nuances of British social and cultural policies. While the British did introduce Western education, it didn't lead to a complete decline of traditional Indian culture.  Instead, a complex interaction occurred, with elements of both Western and Indian cultures coexisting and influencing each other.  The adoption of Western lifestyles was selective and largely confined to certain sections of Indian society.

Christian missionaries did play a role in promoting Western education and social reforms, but their success in converting large sections of the population to Christianity was limited.  While some conversions occurred, the vast majority of Indians retained their traditional faiths.

The British policy toward princely states was not one of complete subjugation and direct rule.  While the British exerted significant control and influence over princely states through the doctrine of paramountcy, the rulers retained considerable autonomy in managing their internal affairs.  The relationship was complex, involving a combination of control, cooperation, and manipulation. Therefore, all three statements contain significant inaccuracies or oversimplifications.


**4. With reference to the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalist movement was primarily led by Moderates who advocated for constitutional methods of achieving self-government, focusing on petitions, public opinion, and gradual reforms.
2. The Moderates enjoyed widespread support among the masses, effectively mobilizing peasants and workers into the national movement to achieve significant political and economic gains.
3. The British government initially ignored the nationalist movement but later adopted a policy of repression, actively suppressing nationalist leaders and publications through arrests and censorship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the leadership and methods of the early nationalist movement. The Moderates, primarily comprised of educated Indians, favored constitutional means like petitions, public meetings, and reasoned appeals to the British government.  Their approach emphasized gradual reform within the existing political framework.

Statement 2 is inaccurate. While the Moderates did aim to build a broad-based movement, their support among the masses was limited.  Their focus on constitutional methods and elite leadership meant that the movement did not effectively penetrate rural areas or mobilize large sections of the peasantry and working class.  Significant political and economic gains remained elusive during this phase.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the British government's response.  Initially, the British authorities largely underestimated the nationalist movement. However, as the movement gained momentum and began to challenge colonial authority, the government resorted to increasingly repressive measures.  This included arresting nationalist leaders, suppressing publications, and employing other methods to stifle dissent.  Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was instrumental in uniting Hindus and Muslims under a common platform of non-violent non-cooperation against the British.
2. The Non-Cooperation Movement saw widespread participation from all sections of Indian society, including peasants, workers, students, and women, leading to the immediate achievement of swaraj.
3. Gandhi's decision to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement following the Chauri Chaura incident was widely supported by other nationalist leaders who agreed with his assessment of the movement's increasingly violent trajectory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Khilafat issue, due to its religious significance for Indian Muslims, played a crucial role in bringing Hindus and Muslims together in opposition to British rule.  The shared grievance over the treatment of Turkey provided a powerful unifying factor, leading to a joint struggle against the colonial government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement did involve participation from various segments of society, it did not lead to the immediate achievement of swaraj.  The movement was ultimately withdrawn by Gandhi after the Chauri Chaura incident.  The movement's impact was significant in galvanizing nationalist sentiment and challenging British authority, but it fell short of its immediate goal of achieving independence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement was met with considerable opposition from other nationalist leaders, many of whom felt that the movement had gained significant momentum and should have continued, despite the violence at Chauri Chaura.  The decision caused significant divisions within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**1. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission aimed for the earliest possible realization of self-government in India, but negotiations failed due to the British refusal to immediately transfer effective power.
2. The failure of the Cripps Mission led to the Congress's decision to launch a non-violent mass struggle for complete independence, culminating in the Quit India Movement.
3.  The immediate arrest of Gandhi and other Congress leaders following the passing of the Quit India Resolution significantly hampered the movement's organized execution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect events surrounding the Cripps Mission and the subsequent Quit India Movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the mission's stated aim and the key reason for its failure: the British unwillingness to cede immediate power. The British government's desire to maintain control, even while promising future self-governance, was a major point of contention.  Statement 2 accurately captures the fallout from the mission's failure. The Congress, frustrated by the lack of concrete progress, resolved to launch a mass struggle for complete independence, leading directly to the Quit India Resolution and the subsequent movement.  Statement 3 is also correct. The preemptive arrest of Gandhi and other key leaders on August 9, 1942, severely disrupted the planned non-violent mass movement, although spontaneous protests did erupt across the country. The lack of organized leadership, due to these arrests, significantly altered the course and effectiveness of the Quit India Movement.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate representations of historical events.


**2. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first stage of the post-CDM debate focused on immediate strategies during a period of non-mass struggle (1934-35), encompassing Gandhian constructive work and constitutional struggle.
2.  The second stage debate (1937), centered on the acceptance of office in provincial governments following the 1935 Government of India Act, saw a significant ideological divide between left and right factions within the Congress.
3. Jawaharlal Nehru, a prominent leftist, opposed the 'struggle-truce-struggle' strategy, advocating for continuous direct action against imperialism until its overthrow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Indian National Congress.  Statement 1 correctly describes the first phase of the debate, which occurred during a period of relative political calm after the CDM's withdrawal. This phase saw discussions centered around Gandhi's emphasis on constructive work and the more moderate approach of constitutional struggle and participation in elections. Statement 2 accurately reflects the second phase of the debate, which arose in 1937 around the issue of whether the Congress should accept office in provincial governments formed under the Government of India Act, 1935. This debate revealed a significant ideological split between the left and right wings of the Congress, highlighting differing views on the most effective path to independence.  Statement 3 accurately portrays Nehru's position. He was a vocal critic of the 'struggle-truce-struggle' strategy, arguing that a continuous confrontation with imperialism was necessary until its complete overthrow.  His preference for a 'struggle-victory' approach demonstrated his distinct leftist ideology within the Congress.  Therefore, all three statements are correct in their depiction of the post-CDM strategic debates.


**3. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lahore Congress session of 1929 formally declared complete independence (Purna Swaraj) as the Congress's goal and decided to boycott the Round Table Conferences.
2. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1931 resulted in the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and Congress participation in the Second Round Table Conference, but failed to secure the release of all political prisoners or a commutation of Bhagat Singh's death sentence.
3. The Third Round Table Conference, held in 1932 without Congress participation, led to the formulation of the Government of India Act, 1935, which introduced provincial autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately represent key events and outcomes related to the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Round Table Conferences. Statement 1 correctly states that the Lahore Congress session of 1929 marked a significant turning point by formally adopting Purna Swaraj as the Congress's goal and deciding to boycott the first Round Table Conference, rejecting dominion status as insufficient. Statement 2 correctly describes the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, which temporarily halted the Civil Disobedience Movement in exchange for some concessions from the British government.  However, the pact did not achieve all of Gandhi's objectives, notably the release of all political prisoners and the commutation of Bhagat Singh's death sentence, illustrating the limitations of negotiation with the colonial power. Statement 3 correctly notes that the Third Round Table Conference, boycotted by the Congress, ultimately contributed to the passage of the Government of India Act, 1935, a landmark legislation that introduced significant constitutional changes, including provincial autonomy.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate depictions of historical events.


**4. With reference to British policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their land, but led to issues like high revenue demands and the growth of absentee landlordism.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed for direct revenue collection from individual cultivators but resulted in overassessment and exploitation of the peasantry.
3. The Mahalwari System, implemented in parts of North India, aimed to assess revenue collectively from village communities but often led to inaccurate assessments and corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the characteristics and consequences of the three major British land revenue systems in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Permanent Settlement's core feature—granting zamindars proprietary rights—and highlights its negative consequences, such as excessively high revenue demands and the rise of absentee landlordism, which led to widespread exploitation of tenant farmers. Statement 2 accurately portrays the Ryotwari System's direct revenue collection approach and its flaws, including overassessment of land revenue and the subsequent hardship faced by the peasantry due to unrealistic tax demands. The system, despite its intention of efficiency, often led to severe exploitation. Statement 3 accurately summarizes the Mahalwari System, emphasizing its attempt at collective revenue assessment from village communities. However, the system suffered from practical issues such as inaccurate assessments, corruption among officials, and ultimately contributed to the economic hardship of the villagers.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate accounts of the British land revenue systems and their impact.


**5. With reference to the post-World War II national scenario in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The release of INA prisoners and the RIN revolt demonstrated widespread anti-British sentiment and significantly weakened the British government's authority.
2.  The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed a three-tier structure for India's governance and a constituent assembly to frame the constitution, but failed to resolve the critical issue of the partition of India.
3. The formation of the Nehru-led Interim Government in 1946, despite the Muslim League's initial opposition, ultimately led to a smooth transfer of power in 1947.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of the post-World War II period in India, while statement 3 is incorrect. Statement 1 correctly highlights the significance of the INA trials and the RIN revolt.  These events showcased the depth of anti-British feeling among Indian soldiers and sailors, directly challenging the British military's authority and undermining its credibility. The widespread public support for the INA prisoners and the participation in the RIN revolt put immense pressure on the British government. Statement 2 correctly describes the Cabinet Mission Plan's key features—a three-tier governance structure and the establishment of a constituent assembly. The plan, however, ultimately failed in its primary objective of preventing the partition of India, as the differences between the Congress and the Muslim League remained irreconcilable. Statement 3 is incorrect. The formation of the Nehru-led Interim Government was far from a smooth transition.  The Muslim League's participation was fraught with tensions and obstructionist tactics, ultimately contributing to the escalating communal violence and the partition of India.  The transfer of power was anything but smooth, marked by significant violence and upheaval. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, such as petitions and public meetings, to press for reforms within the existing British framework.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent early nationalist leader, played a crucial role in educating British public opinion about India's grievances through his work in England.
3. The government's initial response to the nationalist movement was largely tolerant, with the Viceroy even inviting Congress delegates to a garden party in 1886.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict characteristics of the early Indian nationalist movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary approach of early nationalists, who largely favored constitutional methods of political action, working within the legal system to press for reforms.  Their focus was on creating public opinion and petitioning the British government for gradual changes. Statement 2 accurately highlights Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution to the movement.  He dedicated a considerable portion of his time and resources to educating the British public about India’s plight and advocating for its cause in England.  This trans-national engagement was a crucial aspect of the early nationalist strategy. Statement 3 correctly describes the initial, relatively tolerant attitude of the British government towards the nascent nationalist movement.  This initial tolerance, however, did not last, as the movement gained strength and began to challenge British authority more directly.  The garden party invitation to Congress delegates in 1886 reflects this early phase of relative openness. Therefore, all three statements are accurate reflections of this historical period.


**7.  With reference to the emergence of new forces in the Indian national movement during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajist party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for entering legislative councils to obstruct the government's functioning from within.
2. The No-Changers, opposed to council entry, focused on constructive work such as khadi production and national education, preparing for future mass movements.
3. The rise of socialist and communist ideas, influenced by the Russian Revolution, led to the formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the emergence of a left wing within the Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly identify significant developments within the Indian national movement during the 1920s. Statement 1 accurately describes the Swarajist party's strategy.  Led by prominent figures like C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, the Swarajists adopted a policy of entering legislative councils not to cooperate with the government but to obstruct its functioning from within, using the councils as a platform for political struggle. Statement 2 correctly highlights the No-Changers' approach.  This faction, opposing council entry, focused on constructive work aimed at strengthening the national movement's grassroots base and preparing for future mass actions.  Their emphasis on activities like khadi production and the establishment of national educational institutions reflects this strategy. Statement 3 correctly points to the growing influence of socialist and communist ideas, inspired largely by the Russian Revolution.  This led to the formation of the CPI and the emergence of a distinct left wing within the Congress, advocating for more radical socio-economic reforms alongside the struggle for national independence.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the diverse forces shaping the Indian national movement during the 1920s.


**8. With reference to the revolutionary activities in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), aimed to overthrow the colonial government and establish a federal republic based on adult franchise.
2.  The HSRA's activities included the Kakori train robbery, the assassination of John Saunders (mistaken for James Scott), and the throwing of bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly.
3.  In Bengal, the Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, demonstrated the emergence of a more organized and militaristic approach to revolutionary activity, involving significant participation of women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of revolutionary activities in India during the 1920s. Statement 1 correctly identifies the aims of the HRA/HSRA.  This revolutionary organization sought to overthrow British rule through armed struggle and establish a federal republic in India, based on the principle of adult franchise, reflecting their commitment to democratic ideals. Statement 2 accurately lists some of the HSRA's most notable actions. These included the Kakori train robbery, a daring act of defiance aimed at acquiring funds for the revolutionary cause; the assassination of John Saunders (mistaken for James Scott), a response to the death of Lala Lajpat Rai; and the throwing of bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly, a symbolic act of protest against repressive legislation. Statement 3 correctly describes the significance of the Chittagong Armoury Raid.  Led by Surya Sen, this raid in Bengal marked a shift towards a more organized and overtly military approach to revolutionary action.  The raid also involved significant participation of women revolutionaries, demonstrating the growing role of women in the struggle for independence.  Therefore, all three statements accurately represent the multifaceted nature of revolutionary movements in the 1920s.


**9. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

2. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a Congress procession was attacked by police and a police station was burned, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.
3. The suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement was met with mixed reactions, with some younger leaders expressing disappointment and resentment while others remained supportive of Gandhi's decision.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the course of the Non-Cooperation Movement and its impact. Statement 1 correctly describes the broad participation in the movement.  It involved diverse groups, including peasants, students, and significant segments of the Muslim community, united by shared grievances such as the Khilafat issue (concerning the Ottoman Caliphate) and the aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  The movement represented a significant surge of mass mobilization. Statement 2 correctly points to the Chauri Chaura incident as the pivotal event leading to the movement's suspension. This incident, involving violence against police, deeply concerned Gandhi, who believed that adherence to non-violence was crucial for the movement's success and moral integrity.  The incident highlighted the challenges of maintaining discipline within a large-scale mass movement. Statement 3 accurately captures the diversity of reactions to Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement. While many remained supportive of Gandhi's leadership and commitment to non-violence, others, particularly younger and more radical leaders, expressed frustration and disappointment at the perceived retreat, showcasing the internal tensions within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, all three statements provide an accurate portrayal of this historical period.


**10. With reference to the communal situation in India and the development of the two-nation theory, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth of communalism in India was fueled by socio-economic factors such as competition for jobs and resources, exacerbated by British policies of divide and rule.
2.  The Muslim League's demand for separate electorates, initially granted in the Morley-Minto Reforms, gradually evolved into the demand for Pakistan, culminating in the Lahore Resolution of 1940.
3. The Congress's attempts to address communal concerns, such as the Lucknow Pact, ultimately failed to prevent the rise of extreme communalism and the partition of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the complex evolution of communal politics and the two-nation theory in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the socio-economic roots of communalism.  Competition for limited resources like jobs and educational opportunities, often along religious lines, fueled communal tensions.  This was further exacerbated by the British government's deliberate policies of divide and rule, which exploited existing religious differences for their own political advantage. Statement 2 correctly traces the progression of the Muslim League's demands.  The initial demand for separate electorates, granted in the Morley-Minto Reforms, eventually escalated into the more radical demand for a separate Muslim state—Pakistan—formalized in the Lahore Resolution of 1940.  This marked a significant shift in the League's political goals. Statement 3 accurately assesses the limitations of the Congress's attempts at reconciliation.  While efforts such as the Lucknow Pact attempted to address Muslim concerns, they ultimately proved insufficient to prevent the rise of extreme communalism and the eventual partition of India, highlighting the failure of efforts to maintain national unity despite attempts at compromise.  Therefore, all three statements offer accurate insights into this crucial historical development.

2. The 1945-46 elections saw the Congress securing a majority in most provinces, while the Muslim League emerged as the dominant party among the Muslim population. The INA trials and the subsequent agitation played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing the British government's decision-making process.
3. The Cabinet Mission Plan, proposed in 1946, aimed at creating a united India with a three-tier structure (provincial, sectional, and union levels) and a Constituent Assembly to frame the constitution.  However, differences in interpretation of the grouping clause, particularly regarding the formation of Pakistan, led to the plan's eventual failure and escalating communal tensions.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on diverse aspects of the Quit India Movement, Cripps Mission, and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA, demanding factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Cripps Mission:**

1. The Cripps Mission aimed for the "earliest possible realisation of self-government in India," but negotiations failed due to the British refusal to immediately transfer effective power.
2. Indian leaders were dissatisfied with future promises while the Viceroy retained autocratic powers, hindering cooperation in the war effort despite the Japanese threat to Indian territory.
3. The Cripps Mission's failure stemmed primarily from disagreements over the timeframe for independence, with the Congress demanding immediate independence and the British offering a post-war timeline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the circumstances surrounding the Cripps Mission's failure.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the stated British aim of eventual self-government, contrasting it with the reality of the British refusal to cede immediate power. This discrepancy was a major point of contention. Statement 2 accurately captures the Indian leaders' perspective:  promises of future self-rule were insufficient while the Viceroy's autocratic powers remained.  The desire to cooperate in the war effort was conditional upon the formation of a national government, reflecting a pragmatic approach to national interests. Statement 3 correctly identifies the core issue of the disagreement: the timing of independence. While the British envisioned a post-war transfer of power, the Congress insisted on immediate action, making a compromise impossible.  The failure of the mission was a complex event, but these three statements accurately reflect its key components.


**2. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee in August 1942 passed the 'Quit India' Resolution, initiating a non-violent mass struggle under Gandhi's leadership.
2.  The immediate arrest of Gandhi and other Congress leaders after the resolution's passage led to spontaneous, leaderless protests across India, often escalating into violence against symbols of British authority.
3. The movement's success was primarily due to the establishment of well-organized, centrally-controlled parallel governments in various regions, effectively challenging British rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe key aspects of the Quit India Movement. Statement 1 correctly notes the passage of the 'Quit India' Resolution at the Bombay session and the intended non-violent nature of the ensuing struggle.  The resolution's core demand was the immediate end of British rule. Statement 2 accurately describes the government's swift and decisive response of arresting key leaders, which resulted in spontaneous and largely leaderless protests. These protests, while initially non-violent, often turned violent due to police repression and the lack of centralized leadership to guide the movement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While some parallel governments emerged in certain regions, they were largely short-lived, localized, and not the primary reason for the movement's impact.  The movement's significance lay in its widespread, spontaneous nature, even without centralized control.


**3. With reference to Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose escaped India in 1941, initially seeking Soviet support, but later allied with Germany and Japan to organize an armed struggle against British rule.
2. The INA, initially formed by General Mohan Singh, gained significant strength with Bose's arrival in Singapore, where it was renamed the Azad Hind Fauj.
3.  The INA’s military campaign, despite initial successes including the hoisting of the INA flag on Indian soil, ultimately ended in defeat with the collapse of Japan in 1945, resulting in Bose's death in an air crash.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate depictions of Subhas Chandra Bose's activities and the INA's trajectory. Statement 1 correctly outlines Bose's escape from India and his shifting alliances, initially seeking Soviet support before turning to the Axis powers due to the changing geopolitical landscape.  Statement 2 correctly identifies General Mohan Singh's role in the INA's initial formation and the boost it received from Bose's leadership in Singapore, including the name change to Azad Hind Fauj. Statement 3 accurately summarizes the INA's military campaign, its limited successes, its ultimate defeat alongside the Japanese, and the reported death of Bose in an air crash.  The INA's story, while ultimately unsuccessful in its primary goal of liberating India, remains a significant chapter in India's struggle for independence.


**4. Consider the following statements about the impact of the 1942 Quit India Movement:**

1. The movement demonstrated the depth of nationalist sentiment and the people's capacity for struggle and sacrifice, even in the face of brutal repression.
2. The movement’s widespread participation, including from students, workers, and peasants, significantly eroded the loyalty of sections within the British Indian administration and armed forces.
3. The movement’s success in establishing long-term parallel governments across India ultimately led to the granting of independence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately capture significant consequences of the Quit India Movement. Statement 1 rightly points out that despite its ultimate suppression and the intense repression faced by participants, the movement served as a powerful demonstration of the widespread nationalist sentiment and the Indian people's capacity for both sustained struggle and great sacrifice. Statement 2 accurately notes that the movement's broad-based participation, especially among the lower strata, led to a significant erosion of loyalty within the British Indian administration and armed forces, highlighting the impact of the movement on the colonial power structure.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the movement was undeniably impactful, it did not lead to the establishment of lasting parallel governments across India.  Independence came about through a complex interplay of factors following the movement, but the movement itself did not directly result in the establishment of a fully functioning alternative administration.



**5. With reference to the post-World War II period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wavell Plan aimed to reconstruct the Viceroy's Executive Council with a majority of Indians, but failed due to the Muslim League's demand for exclusive representation of Muslim members.
2. The trials of INA officers, initially perceived as traitors by the British, were met with massive popular protests, highlighting the changing political landscape and influencing the British Government's decision to release them.
3. The changed attitude of the British Government towards granting Indian independence was solely due to the military and economic weakening of Britain after the war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key events and their implications in the post-World War II period. Statement 1 correctly describes the Wavell Plan's objective of reconstructing the Viceroy's Executive Council, highlighting the League's demand for exclusive Muslim representation as the key reason for the plan's failure. This demonstrates the increasing communal tensions and the British government's attempts to navigate them. Statement 2 accurately captures the public reaction to the INA trials, underscoring the shift in the political dynamics. The outpouring of support for the INA officers, initially considered traitors by the British, significantly influenced the government's decision to release them, reflecting the growing tide of Indian nationalism. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Britain's weakened military and economic position after the war undoubtedly played a role, other factors, such as international pressure and the changing political climate within Britain itself (with the Labour Party's ascent to power), significantly contributed to the changed British attitude toward Indian independence. The decision was a complex one with multiple contributing causes.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for a constitutional struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature as a means to maintain political interest and morale.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend within the Congress, criticized both constructive work and council entry, favoring the resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later conceded to it, allowing Congressmen to participate in legislatures while cautioning against being drawn into constitutionalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the multifaceted debates within the Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies a significant group of Congress leaders who favored a constitutional approach, utilizing elections and legislative participation to maintain public engagement and build the Congress's presence.  Their argument was not simply about faith in constitutional politics but a strategic move to maintain political momentum during a period of relative calm.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Nehru's leftist stance, emphasizing his opposition to both Gandhian constructive work and electoral politics in favor of continued mass action. He viewed these alternative strategies as a retreat from the revolutionary struggle against colonialism, particularly given the continuing economic crisis and the potential for mass mobilization.  Statement 3 correctly describes Gandhi's evolving position on office acceptance. While initially resistant, he ultimately allowed Congress participation in legislatures, but with the crucial caveat that this should not be equated with acceptance of the existing constitutional framework or a compromise on the ultimate goal of independence.  His approach was a pragmatic attempt to balance the differing factions within the Congress and maintain its overall political strength. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, but this federation never materialized due to non-fulfillment of preconditions regarding princely state participation.
2.  At the federal level, the Governor-General held significant power, controlling reserved subjects like foreign affairs and defense, while transferred subjects were administered by ministers responsible to the federal legislature.
3. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, and granted provinces considerable financial independence, but the Governor retained significant powers, including the ability to override legislative decisions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 was a complex piece of legislation with far-reaching consequences. Statement 1 accurately describes the proposed All-India Federation as a key feature of the Act.  The Act's ambition to unite British India and the princely states into a single federation was ultimately thwarted by the failure to meet the preconditions for princely state participation, leaving the federation unrealized. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Act's structure at the federal level, highlighting the Governor-General's considerable power over reserved subjects and the limited responsibility of the ministers to the legislature. This division of power reflected the British government's continued desire to maintain ultimate control.  Statement 3 correctly explains the Act's introduction of provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system. While granting provinces greater autonomy and financial powers, the Act also included significant safeguards for the British government, granting Governors extensive powers to intervene in provincial matters, especially concerning minorities and law and order. The Governor's power to override legislative decisions ensured that British interests remained paramount.  Therefore, all three statements are correct representations of the Act's provisions and outcomes.


**3. With reference to the nationalist response to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Congress, while opposing the Act, participated in the 1937 provincial elections, using the opportunity to demonstrate its popularity and garner support.
2. The Congress ministries formed after the 1937 elections implemented significant agrarian reforms, completely abolishing the zamindari system and drastically reducing rural indebtedness.
3.  The Congress ministries' approach to labor issues involved balancing the promotion of workers' interests with the maintenance of industrial peace, often utilizing mediation and arbitration to mitigate labor unrest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Congress's response to the Government of India Act, 1935, and its subsequent rule in the provinces are complex and require nuanced understanding. Statement 1 is accurate: despite its strong opposition to the Act, the Congress strategically participated in the 1937 elections. This was a calculated move to demonstrate popular support, expose the Act's shortcomings, and gain control of provincial governments.  The Congress's sweeping victory in many provinces highlighted its dominance in Indian politics. Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While Congress ministries did attempt agrarian reforms, they did *not* completely abolish the zamindari system.  The limitations of their power, insufficient resources, and the need for political maneuvering with landowning classes prevented a complete overhaul of the agrarian structure. Debt relief measures were implemented, but they were far from eliminating rural indebtedness entirely. Statement 3 is accurate: the Congress ministries adopted a pragmatic approach to labor issues.  They aimed to improve workers' conditions and secure wage increases, but simultaneously prioritized industrial peace.  This often involved mediation, arbitration, and sometimes the use of repressive measures to control militant trade union activities. The balance between supporting workers and maintaining stability was a defining aspect of their approach. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the debates within the Indian National Congress regarding strategies for the freedom struggle during World War II:**

1. Subhas Chandra Bose advocated for a six-month ultimatum to Britain to grant independence, threatening a mass civil disobedience movement if the ultimatum was rejected.
2.  Gandhi opposed Bose's approach, arguing that neither the Congress organization nor the Indian masses were prepared for such a decisive confrontation during a period of international crisis.
3.  The Tripuri Congress session saw a resolution passed reaffirming faith in Gandhian policies and requesting Bose to form a working committee in accordance with Gandhi's wishes, leading to a significant internal crisis within the Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The divergence in strategies within the Congress during World War II highlights a critical juncture in the Indian freedom struggle. Statement 1 accurately reflects Bose's more militant approach.  He believed in leveraging the international situation to pressure Britain for immediate independence, advocating for a strong ultimatum and a mass movement if Britain refused to yield.  Statement 2 correctly describes Gandhi's opposition to Bose's strategy.  Gandhi believed that the Congress and the Indian masses were not adequately prepared for a large-scale confrontation during the war, citing concerns about communal disharmony and the lack of a unified vision.  Statement 3 is also accurate. The Tripuri Congress session witnessed a resolution that, while seemingly conciliatory, ultimately exacerbated the internal crisis.  The resolution called for Bose to form a working committee aligned with Gandhi's preferences, which Bose refused, leading to his resignation and the further polarization of the Congress. Therefore, all three statements correctly depict the complex internal dynamics and differing viewpoints within the Congress during this period.


**5. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission proposed the formation of an Indian Union with dominion status, granting it the right to secede from the Commonwealth after the war.
2.  The Cripps Mission's proposals for a constituent assembly included a provision allowing provinces unwilling to join the Indian Union to have separate constitutions and form separate unions.
3.  The Congress's rejection of the Cripps Mission's proposals was primarily due to its insistence on immediate transfer of power and its opposition to the provision allowing provinces to secede.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Cripps Mission, though ultimately unsuccessful, represents a crucial moment in the negotiations leading to Indian independence. Statement 1 is accurate; the mission proposed an Indian Union with dominion status, allowing for the possibility of eventual secession from the Commonwealth. This option, though not explicitly stated as immediate independence, was a significant concession. Statement 2 is also correct; a key provision of the Cripps proposals was the option for provinces to opt out of the Indian Union and negotiate separate constitutional arrangements. This provision was a blueprint for the later partition of India. Statement 3 is also accurate; the Congress's rejection of the Cripps proposals stemmed from multiple factors, including the lack of immediate transfer of power and the unacceptable provision allowing provinces to secede.  While the Congress desired independence, the offer of dominion status and the potential for partition were major points of contention. The Congress also criticized the continued British control over defense and the lack of meaningful power sharing in the interim period. Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Cripps Mission and its reception by the Congress.


**6. With reference to the post-World War II national scenario in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Army (INA) trials and the subsequent mass agitation significantly impacted the morale of the British armed forces and contributed to the growing perception of the British Raj's vulnerability.
2. The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt of 1946, characterized by widespread participation and unity across religious lines, demonstrated the weakening of British authority and the rising tide of Indian nationalism.
3.  The Cabinet Mission Plan, while aiming for a united India, included a provision for the grouping of provinces, which was interpreted differently by the Congress and the Muslim League, ultimately contributing to the failure of the plan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic shift in the power dynamics in India.  Statement 1 is correct; the INA trials and the massive public support for the accused soldiers severely undermined British authority and prestige. The widespread nature of the agitation, involving diverse social groups and even sections within the British armed forces, demonstrated the fragility of British control and fueled the nationalist movement. Statement 2 is also correct; the RIN revolt was a watershed moment, showcasing the extent of Indian nationalist sentiment and the erosion of British control. While the revolt displayed significant unity among Indian sailors across religious lines, it was ultimately short-lived due to internal divisions and the British ability to regain control.  However, it remains a potent symbol of the weakening British authority and the growing power of Indian nationalism. Statement 3 is also accurate; the Cabinet Mission Plan's attempt at a united India was complicated by the provision for the grouping of provinces. The Congress and the Muslim League interpreted the grouping clause differently, with the League viewing it as a step towards Pakistan and the Congress emphasizing its optional nature. This difference in interpretation, along with other issues, led to the failure of the plan and further exacerbated communal tensions. Therefore, all three statements correctly reflect significant events and processes in the final years of British rule.


**7.  With reference to the emergence of communalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British policy of divide and rule, using communal differences to weaken the nationalist movement, played a significant role in the growth of communalism in India.
2.  The socio-economic disparities between Hindus and Muslims, exacerbated by colonial policies, contributed to the rise of communal ideologies that presented religious differences as incompatible with national unity.
3.  The development of the two-nation theory, advocating for the creation of separate Hindu and Muslim states, was a gradual process, influenced by political maneuvering, socio-religious reform movements, and interpretations of history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The rise of communalism in India is a complex phenomenon with deep historical roots.  Statement 1 is accurate; the British policy of divide and rule actively exploited existing communal tensions and created new ones to weaken the nationalist movement.  By favoring certain communities over others, offering concessions, and promoting religious divisions, the British exacerbated communal differences and made it more difficult for a unified national identity to emerge. Statement 2 is also correct; socio-economic disparities between Hindus and Muslims were a crucial factor in the rise of communal ideologies. Colonial economic policies and the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities created resentment and fostered a sense of separate interests among different religious communities.  These disparities were often interpreted through a religious lens, leading to the belief that religious differences were irreconcilable with national unity. Statement 3 is also accurate; the two-nation theory, advocating for the partition of India, did not emerge suddenly. It was a gradual evolution influenced by various factors, including political strategies of the Muslim League, socio-religious reform movements that sometimes reinforced communal identities, and interpretations of history that emphasized religious differences over shared national experiences.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the multifaceted causes of the growth of communalism in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the post-CDM debates within the Indian National Congress.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the two-phased nature of the debate, highlighting the immediate post-movement strategy discussions (1934-35) and the later debate surrounding participation in the 1937 provincial elections.  Statement 2 accurately captures Nehru's opposition to the S-T-S strategy and his advocacy for a continuous struggle until victory (S-V), a crucial ideological divergence within the Congress. Statement 3 correctly points to the AICC's decision in Patna, which effectively resolved the internal conflict regarding participation in elections, leading to the formation of a Parliamentary Board. The formation of the board marked a significant step towards Congress' participation in electoral politics.  There were apprehensions and disagreements but they were resolved before 1937 elections.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established an All-India Federation, encompassing British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, but its formation was contingent upon the accession of Indian states representing 50% of the total Indian states' population.
2.  At the federal level, the Governor-General held significant power, including the ability to act in his individual judgment on matters concerning the security and tranquillity of India, and controlled 80% of the budget.
3.  Provincial autonomy replaced dyarchy, granting provinces significant financial powers and independent legal identities, but Governors retained extensive powers, including the right to take over and indefinitely run administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of the key features of the Government of India Act, 1935. Statement 1 correctly describes the proposed All-India Federation and the conditions attached to its formation, which ultimately prevented its realization.  The Act envisioned a federation including British Indian provinces, chief commissioner provinces and Indian states.  The conditionality of the federation's establishment based on the accession of states with a combined population of 50% was a significant aspect that hindered its implementation. Statement 2 accurately describes the substantial powers vested in the Governor-General at the federal level, including his individual judgment powers and control over a significant portion (80%) of the budget. This underscores the limitations on Indian self-governance despite the introduction of certain reforms. Statement 3 accurately details the shift from dyarchy to provincial autonomy, highlighting the increased financial and legal autonomy granted to the provinces. However, it also points out the retention of extensive powers by the Governors, maintaining a significant degree of British control over provincial administrations.  The Governor's power to take over and run the administration indefinitely demonstrates the limitations on provincial autonomy.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission proposed the creation of an Indian Union with dominion status after World War II, with the option for provinces unwilling to join the Union to have separate constitutions and form separate Unions.
2.  A key condition for granting independence with full sovereign status to India after the war was the active participation and cooperation of the Indian people, communities, and political parties in the British war efforts.
3. The mission's proposals included a detailed plan for a constituent assembly, where members would be partly elected by provincial assemblies and partly nominated by the princely states to frame a new constitution for a free India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the Cripps Mission's proposals. Statement 1 correctly outlines the offer of dominion status for an Indian Union, with the crucial provision allowing provinces to opt out and form separate unions—a significant element contributing to the mission's failure and foreshadowing the partition of India.  Statement 3 accurately describes the proposed constituent assembly, highlighting the method of electing members (partly through provincial assemblies and partly through princely state nominations). This hybrid approach, along with other aspects of the proposal, proved contentious and contributed to the mission's failure. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Indian cooperation in the war effort was undoubtedly a consideration, it wasn't presented as a *condition* for granting full sovereign status after the war. The mission's failure stemmed from fundamental disagreements over the nature of independence, immediate power transfer, and the treatment of princely states.


**4. With reference to the post-World War II struggle for Indian independence, consider the following statements:**

1. The trial of INA officers at the Red Fort in Delhi, initially perceived as a show of British strength, ultimately led to their release due to the changing global power dynamics and growing pressure from the US and USSR.
2.  The changed attitude of the British government towards India after the war was influenced by Britain’s weakened economic and military position, a change in government in Britain (Conservatives replaced by Labour), and the diminished reliability of the Indian personnel in the British Indian Army and civil administration.
3. Subhash Chandra Bose's formation of the Azad Hind Fauj (INA), though ultimately unsuccessful due to Japan's defeat, significantly boosted Indian morale and revealed the heroism and determination of the Indian people, inspiring renewed calls for independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict aspects of the post-war struggle. Statement 1 correctly explains the trial of INA officers and its outcome.  The trial was initially intended to assert British authority, but the shifting global power dynamics and international pressure forced a change in policy, leading to the release of the INA officers.  Statement 2 accurately identifies the factors contributing to the British government's changed attitude: Britain's weakened position after the war, the Labour Party's ascent to power (with its more sympathetic stance toward Indian independence), and the erosion of loyalty within the Indian army and civil services (as demonstrated by the INA).  Statement 3 accurately assesses the impact of Subhash Chandra Bose's INA.  While the INA's military campaign failed, its symbolic significance in boosting Indian morale and demonstrating the people's determination was immense, influencing the subsequent phases of the independence movement.  The INA's actions significantly impacted the morale of the Indian people and played a role in pressuring the British government.


**5. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  While Gandhi championed ahimsa and satyagraha as the primary means to achieve independence, Bose believed that violent resistance was necessary to overthrow British rule and saw the opportunity presented by Britain's wartime vulnerabilities.
2.  Gandhi adhered strictly to the principle that means and ends must be equally virtuous, while Bose prioritized the outcome, justifying his collaboration with the Axis powers as a strategic necessity to achieve independence.
3.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for a socialist future for India, albeit with differing interpretations and approaches, with Gandhi favoring a decentralized, village-based economy and Bose endorsing industrialization and state-controlled economic planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately highlight the key ideological differences between Gandhi and Bose.  Statement 1 correctly contrasts their approaches to the freedom struggle: Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence versus Bose's belief in the necessity of violent resistance, particularly given Britain's weakened state during the war. Statement 2 correctly points to the contrasting philosophies regarding means and ends. Gandhi's emphasis on ethical means, even if it meant a slower path to independence, contrasted sharply with Bose's pragmatism, which prioritized the end goal of independence even if it meant aligning with forces he ideologically opposed. Statement 3 correctly notes their shared socialist vision, but also their divergent approaches: Gandhi's preference for a decentralized, village-based economy versus Bose's advocacy for industrialization and state-led economic planning.  Their differing views on the role of the state and the nature of economic development further underscore their ideological divergence.


**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1858-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Ilbert Bill controversy primarily concerned the jurisdiction of European judges over Indian citizens.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's work significantly contributed to exposing the economic drain of British rule on India.
3. The Indian Association, founded in Bombay, played a crucial role in shaping early nationalist thought.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ilbert Bill, introduced in 1883, aimed to grant Indian magistrates the power to try European British citizens.  The controversy that erupted highlighted the deep-seated racial discrimination within the colonial judicial system and fueled nationalist sentiment.  The bill's defeat showed the limits of British willingness to grant legal equality to Indians.


Statement 2 is also correct. Dadabhai Naoroji, a pioneer of Indian nationalism, is renowned for his meticulous analysis of India's economic condition under British rule. His work, notably "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," effectively demonstrated the systematic drain of wealth from India to Britain, a crucial factor in shaping nationalist economic thought and fueling the movement.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian Association, a key organization in the early nationalist movement, was founded in Calcutta, not Bombay.  The Bombay Presidency had its own influential associations contributing to nationalist sentiment, but the specific association mentioned is incorrectly located.  The error in the location makes the statement factually incorrect.


**2. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anushilan Samiti was primarily active in Bengal and had a vast network of branches.
2. V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a secret society that advocated for assassinating unpopular British officials.
3. Shyamji Krishna Verma, while based in London, actively promoted revolutionary ideas and provided support to Indian revolutionaries abroad.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the rise of revolutionary terrorism in India.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent revolutionary organization, was indeed heavily concentrated in Bengal and boasted an extensive network of branches, demonstrating the widespread nature of the movement within that region.  Their activities included both propaganda and direct action.


V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a significant secret society that actively promoted revolutionary terrorism, including the assassination of unpopular British officials. This reflects a strategy of targeting specific individuals perceived as symbols of oppression.  Their methods and ideology were influential in shaping the revolutionary movement.


Shyamji Krishna Verma's contributions to the cause are also accurately depicted. Based in London, he played a vital role in disseminating revolutionary ideas among Indian students and intellectuals abroad, providing crucial support and resources to the revolutionary underground within India. His activities represent the international dimension of the movement.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Andolan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, severely curtailed civil liberties in India, contributing to widespread discontent.
2. The Hunter Committee, appointed to investigate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was widely considered to be a whitewash.
3. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, implemented in 1919, fully addressed Indian demands for self-government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Rowlatt Act, enacted in 1919, allowed the government to imprison individuals without trial, severely restricting fundamental rights. This draconian measure heightened public anger and resentment against the British, creating a fertile ground for the Non-Cooperation Movement. The act's repressive nature directly contributed to the growing anti-colonial sentiment.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Hunter Committee, established to investigate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was widely criticized for its biased and inadequate findings. The committee's report largely exonerated the British authorities responsible for the massacre, fueling further outrage and distrust among Indians.  Its perceived lack of impartiality undermined public faith in the colonial government's willingness to address grievances fairly.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing some limited self-governance measures (dyarchy), fell far short of meeting Indian aspirations for complete self-rule. The reforms were widely seen as inadequate and did not alleviate the growing demand for independence, thus failing to satisfy the burgeoning nationalist sentiment. The reforms' shortcomings only further intensified the desire for complete self-governance.


**4. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for a constitutional struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru strongly opposed both Gandhian constructive work and council entry, advocating for the continuation of mass struggle.
3. Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later conceded, allowing Congressmen to participate in legislatures while maintaining a commitment to combating the 1935 Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the diverse perspectives and evolving strategies within the Indian National Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The first statement correctly identifies a faction within the Congress, including prominent leaders like M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai, who advocated for a strategy involving constitutional engagement, participation in elections, and working within the existing legislative framework. This group believed that even limited participation could maintain political momentum and influence.


The second statement accurately portrays Jawaharlal Nehru's stance. He was critical of both the Gandhian emphasis on constructive work and the strategy of entering legislative councils. Nehru argued that these approaches would divert attention from the primary goal of achieving independence through mass struggle and criticized them as reformist rather than revolutionary.


The third statement correctly describes Gandhi's evolving position on office acceptance. While initially opposed to the idea of Congress participation in the legislatures, Gandhi ultimately agreed to allow Congressmen to contest elections and potentially form ministries in the provinces.  However, this decision was made with the explicit understanding that this participation would not signify acceptance of the 1935 Act but would instead serve as a tactical maneuver in the ongoing struggle for independence.


**5. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution, passed in August 1942, demanded an immediate end to British rule in India and the formation of a provisional government.
2.  The arrest of top Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, resulted in a spontaneous and widespread movement, often characterized by underground activities and the establishment of parallel governments.
3. The Muslim League actively supported the Quit India Movement, viewing it as a crucial step towards achieving Indian independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Resolution, passed at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Bombay in August 1942, unequivocally demanded an immediate end to British rule and proposed the formation of a provisional government to govern India after British withdrawal. The resolution clearly articulated the Congress's demand for immediate independence and laid the groundwork for a mass movement.


Statement 2 is also correct. The swift arrest of top Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, did not prevent a massive upsurge.  The movement that followed was largely spontaneous, lacking centralized leadership.  It was marked by widespread underground activities, the establishment of parallel governments in various regions, and a significant level of popular participation despite the absence of established leadership.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League did *not* support the Quit India Movement.  The League was apprehensive of a Congress-led independent India, fearing the potential for the oppression of Muslim minorities.  Their opposition stemmed from their pursuit of a separate Muslim state (Pakistan) and distrust of the Congress's intentions regarding minority rights.  The League's stance highlights the growing communal divide within the Indian nationalist movement.


**6. With reference to the post-war national scenario in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt of 1946 was a significant event demonstrating widespread anti-British sentiment within the armed forces.
2. The Cabinet Mission Plan, proposed in 1946, aimed for a united India with a three-tier system of governance (provincial, sectional, and union).
3. The Desai-Liaqat Pact proposed parity between Congress and Muslim League representation in an interim government at the center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the post-World War II national scenario in India. The RIN revolt of February 1946 was a landmark event, demonstrating the erosion of loyalty within the armed forces and highlighting the widespread anti-British sentiment that had permeated even the ranks of the military. The revolt's impact on the British decision to withdraw was significant.


The Cabinet Mission Plan, presented in 1946, aimed to create a united India with a complex three-tier system of governance. This plan involved a federal structure with provincial, sectional, and union levels, reflecting an attempt to balance the demands of different regions and communities while maintaining a unified nation.  Its failure to achieve its goals is well-documented.


The Desai-Liaqat Pact, an attempt at compromise between the Congress and the Muslim League, aimed to establish parity in representation within an interim government at the center.  This reflects efforts towards power-sharing and an attempt to resolve the growing political deadlock.  The pact, while ultimately unsuccessful in achieving its goals, is important in understanding the dynamics of the time.  The failure of this pact reveals the deepening chasm between the two major political forces.


**1. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian nationalist movement after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, S. Satyamurthy, and B.C. Roy advocated for a constitutional struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature, arguing that it would maintain political interest and morale during periods of political apathy.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend within the Congress, criticized both constructive work and council entry, advocating for the resumption of non-constitutional mass struggle to maintain the revolutionary character of the movement.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later, through conciliation, allowed Congressmen to participate in legislatures, provided they didn't compromise with imperialism or get sucked into constitutionalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the multifaceted debates within the Indian National Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies a group of Congress leaders who championed council entry as a strategic tool to maintain political momentum and influence during periods of non-mass struggle. Their arguments emphasized using elections and council work to keep the political spirit alive and build the Congress's strength.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Nehru's leftist perspective, which sharply contrasted with the more moderate views.  Nehru's critique focused on the potential for council entry to derail mass action and dilute the revolutionary fervor necessary for achieving complete independence. He advocated for a continuous, non-constitutional struggle. Statement 3 correctly describes Gandhi's evolving position on office acceptance.  Initially hesitant, he eventually reconciled with the idea of council entry as a tactical maneuver, emphasizing that it should not lead to a compromise of the movement's ultimate goals.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate representations of the historical events and differing viewpoints within the Congress.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, with the federation's formation contingent upon the accession of princely states representing 50% of the total Indian states population.
2.  At the federal level, the Governor-General held significant powers, including reserved subjects (foreign affairs, defense, etc.) administered solely on the advice of executive councillors not responsible to the legislature, and the power to act in his individual judgment on matters of security and tranquillity.
3. Provincial autonomy under the Act replaced dyarchy, granting provinces separate legal identities, independent financial powers, and the ability to administer all provincial subjects through councils of ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of the Government of India Act, 1935. Statement 1 correctly outlines the Act's ambitious plan for an All-India Federation, a crucial element that ultimately failed due to the non-fulfillment of the conditions regarding the accession of princely states.  The conditional nature of the federation's formation is a key aspect of the Act's legacy. Statement 2 accurately highlights the substantial powers retained by the Governor-General, emphasizing the division between reserved and transferred subjects and the Governor-General's ability to act independently in matters of security, reflecting the continued British control over key areas. Statement 3 correctly explains the shift from dyarchy to provincial autonomy, detailing the enhanced powers granted to provinces in terms of administration, finance, and legislative responsibility.  The replacement of dyarchy and the significant increase in provincial autonomy are defining characteristics of the Act.  Therefore, all three statements are correct and provide a comprehensive overview of the Act's main features.


**3. With reference to the events leading up to the partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Clement Attlee's statement of February 20, 1947, fixed a deadline of June 30, 1948, for the transfer of power, indicating a willingness to grant independence even without an agreement on the constitutional framework between Indian political parties.
2.  The Mountbatten Plan of June 3, 1947, proposed that the Legislative Assemblies of Punjab and Bengal vote on the partition of their respective provinces, with a simple majority in either Hindu or Muslim group sufficient to trigger partition.
3.  The Indian Independence Act of 1947, passed by the British Parliament and implemented on August 15, 1947, formally established the independent dominions of India and Pakistan, with each dominion having a Governor-General responsible for the Act's implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect crucial events leading to the partition of India. Statement 1 correctly describes Attlee's significant announcement, which set a firm deadline for the transfer of power, irrespective of the ongoing political deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League. This demonstrated a clear intent to withdraw from India, even if it meant a partitioned transfer of power. Statement 2 accurately outlines the core mechanism of the Mountbatten Plan, which involved the crucial decision-making process within the Legislative Assemblies of Punjab and Bengal regarding partition, highlighting the role of the separate Hindu and Muslim majorities in determining the fate of these provinces.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the Indian Independence Act as the formal legal instrument that created independent India and Pakistan, specifying the key role of the Governors-General in implementing the Act's provisions.  The Act's passage and implementation marked the end of British rule and the beginning of two independent nations.  Thus, all three statements are historically accurate and essential for understanding the events leading to the partition.


**4. With reference to the post-World War II national scenario in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The release of Congress leaders from jail in June 1945, following the end of World War II in Europe, was met with a resurgence of popular energy and heightened expectations, which were not met by the Wavell Plan.
2. The INA trials, particularly the trial of Prem Kumar Sehgal, Shah Nawaz Khan, and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon at the Red Fort, sparked a massive pro-INA agitation across India, significantly eroding the morale of the British armed forces and administration.
3.  The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt of February 18, 1946, in Bombay, involving approximately 1100 ratings, was triggered by issues such as racial discrimination, poor food, and the INA trials, and demonstrated a widespread anti-British sentiment within the armed forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the volatile post-World War II political climate in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the situation following the release of Congress leaders. The pent-up popular energy and heightened expectations were indeed not satisfied by the Wavell Plan, contributing to further political unrest.  Statement 2 accurately captures the significant impact of the INA trials. The trial of the three named officers at the Red Fort did indeed galvanize widespread public support for the INA and severely damaged the morale of the British forces and administration. The agitation was truly massive and had a profound impact.  Statement 3 accurately recounts the events of the RIN revolt, highlighting the specific grievances of the ratings and the clear demonstration of anti-British sentiment within the armed forces, which was a serious blow to British authority. The revolt's scale and impact on British morale are well-documented.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate and illustrate the escalating challenges faced by the British government in India.


**5. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan rejected the demand for a full-fledged Pakistan due to concerns about the large non-Muslim populations in the proposed areas, potential disruption of regional ties, and the complexities of partitioning the armed forces.
2.  The plan proposed grouping the existing provincial assemblies into three sections (A, B, and C), with a three-tier executive and legislature at provincial, sectional, and union levels, and a constituent assembly elected by proportional representation.
3. The plan granted provinces full autonomy and residual powers, with the common center controlling only defense, communication, and external affairs, and allowing provinces to leave a group after the first general elections and reconsider the group or union constitution after ten years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately reflect the key provisions and rationale behind the Cabinet Mission Plan. Statement 1 correctly identifies the plan's rejection of a full-fledged Pakistan and the reasons behind this decision. The concerns about non-Muslim populations, disruption of regional ties, and the complexities of partitioning the armed forces were indeed central to the Mission's decision to propose an alternative framework. Statement 2 correctly describes the plan's proposed grouping of provinces into three sections and the structure of the three-tier executive and legislature, as well as the method of electing the constituent assembly.  The emphasis on proportional representation is a key aspect of the plan. Statement 3 correctly outlines the plan's provisions regarding provincial autonomy, the powers of the common center, and the provisions for provinces to leave a group or reconsider the constitution in the future.  These provisions highlight the plan's attempt to balance unity and autonomy.  Therefore, all three statements are correct in their description of the Cabinet Mission Plan's crucial aspects.


**6.  With reference to the growth of communalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "drain theory," advanced by early Indian nationalists, highlighted the economic exploitation of India by British rule, but failed to address the underlying socio-economic factors that contributed to the growth of communalism.
2.  The British government's policy of "divide and rule" involved using concessions, favors, and reservations to fuel communal and separatist tendencies, exploiting existing socio-religious distinctions to maintain control and weaken the nationalist movement.
3. The Communal Award of 1932, which granted separate electorates and reserved seats for various religious and caste groups, exacerbated communal tensions and further entrenched communal identities, despite opposition from many nationalist leaders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the "drain theory" was a powerful critique of British economic exploitation, it didn't directly address the socio-economic roots of communalism.  Statement 1 is therefore partially incorrect; while the drain theory was important, it wasn't directly focused on communalism.  However, statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Statement 2 correctly identifies the British government's deliberate use of "divide and rule" tactics to exploit existing social divisions for political advantage. This policy contributed significantly to the growth of communalism. Statement 3 accurately describes the Communal Award and its negative impact. The Award's provisions for separate electorates deepened communal cleavages and strengthened sectarian identities, despite the concerns raised by many nationalists.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct, highlighting the role of British policy and the Communal Award in exacerbating communal tensions.


**7. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was launched in response to the failure of the Cripps Mission, widespread popular discontent due to wartime hardships, and news of British reverses in South-East Asia, which undermined British prestige and fueled anti-colonial sentiment.
2.  The "Quit India" resolution, passed at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Bombay on August 8, 1942, demanded an immediate end to British rule, declared commitment to fighting fascism and imperialism, and sanctioned a mass civil disobedience movement under Gandhi's leadership.
3. The movement's widespread participation encompassed students, workers, peasants, and even some government officials, leading to the establishment of parallel governments in several regions, and resulted in widespread government repression, including arrests, violence, and punitive measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the context, goals, and impact of the Quit India Movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies the key factors that propelled the launch of the movement. The failure of the Cripps Mission, widespread public discontent due to wartime hardships, and news of British defeats in South-East Asia were all crucial catalysts in fostering the conditions for a mass movement. Statement 2 correctly describes the content of the "Quit India" resolution, highlighting its key demands and the authorization of a mass civil disobedience movement under Gandhi's leadership. The resolution's clear call for immediate independence is a central element.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the diverse participation in the movement and the government's brutal response.  The involvement of various sections of society, the establishment of parallel governments, and the widespread repression are all well-documented aspects of the movement.  Therefore, all three statements provide a correct and comprehensive account of the Quit India Movement.


**8. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat Movement, though not directly linked to Indian politics, provided a crucial platform for Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule, leveraging the widespread anger among Indian Muslims over the post-World War I treatment of Turkey.
2. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, involved boycotting British institutions (schools, colleges, law courts, legislative councils), foreign goods, and government titles, and promoting swadeshi and constructive work, with a goal of achieving Swaraj.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident of February 5, 1922, where a mob of protestors attacked a police station, resulting in the deaths of policemen, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to concerns about escalating violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

The movement's goals and methods are accurately described.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the Chauri Chaura incident as a turning point, explaining Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement due to concerns about the growing violence and the need to uphold the principle of non-violence.  The incident's impact on the movement's trajectory is well-established.  Therefore, all three statements are correct and provide a comprehensive overview of these two significant movements.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the Non-Cooperation Movement and related historical events.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Khilafat issue, though not directly linked to Indian politics, significantly contributed to Hindu-Muslim unity during the movement.
2.  The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee report all fueled widespread discontent and strengthened anti-British sentiment.
3.  The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, despite aiming for dyarchy, successfully addressed the Indian demand for self-government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, resonated deeply with Indian Muslims and provided a crucial platform for uniting Hindus and Muslims against British rule. This unity was a key factor in the success of the Non-Cooperation Movement's initial stages.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rowlatt Act, which allowed for detention without trial, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a brutal act of violence against peaceful protestors, and the perceived whitewash of the Punjab atrocities by the Hunter Committee all significantly contributed to the widespread anger and resentment that fueled the Non-Cooperation Movement. These events exposed the brutality of British rule and galvanized the Indian population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms introduced the system of dyarchy, dividing power between Indian and British officials. However, these reforms fell far short of satisfying the growing Indian demand for self-government, which was a major cause of the discontent leading to the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The reforms were seen as inadequate and insufficient to address the fundamental issues of colonial rule.


**2. With reference to the participants and leaders of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah, a staunch supporter of the movement, actively participated in its various phases.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi played a pivotal role in uniting the Khilafat leaders and the Congress, leading to the joint movement.
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, initially skeptical of the movement’s religious dimension and the method of Satyagraha, later became a key figure in its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi was instrumental in bringing together the Khilafat leaders and the Indian National Congress, recognizing the potential of a unified movement against British rule. His leadership and advocacy were crucial in launching the joint Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement but later withdrew his support due to disagreements over the movement's approach and strategy. He was not a continuous and unwavering supporter of the movement throughout its course.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak passed away before the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched. Although there were initial discussions about the movement and his potential involvement, his death prevented him from playing any direct role.


**3. With reference to the impact and aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence against the police, led to the movement's immediate and complete suspension by Gandhi.
2.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from diverse sections of society, including peasants, students, and women.
3.  The Khilafat issue remained a central motivating factor for the movement until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924, significantly impacting its duration and intensity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the deaths of policemen, prompted Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. He believed that the movement's non-violent nature was being compromised.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement saw participation from a broad spectrum of Indian society, including peasants, students, and women, demonstrating the movement's wide reach and appeal.  This broad-based participation is a key feature often highlighted in historical analyses.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Khilafat issue was initially a major driving force behind the movement, its relevance diminished considerably after the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924.  The movement's momentum had already significantly waned before this event, primarily due to the Chauri Chaura incident and other factors. The abolition of the Caliphate served as a confirmation of the changing political landscape, not a major determinant of the movement's end.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the objectives of the Khilafat Movement:**

1.  A primary objective was to rouse anti-British sentiment among Indian Muslims.
2.  The movement aimed to reform Muslim society along modern lines.
3.  The movement's central goal was to preserve the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat Movement successfully tapped into the existing anti-British sentiment among Indian Muslims, leveraging their religious feelings to mobilize support against the British government.  This is a key factor in understanding the movement's success.

Statement 3 is correct. The preservation of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate were central to the Khilafat Movement's aims.  The perceived threat to the Ottoman Empire, seen as the center of the Islamic world, deeply resonated with Indian Muslims, providing a powerful religious and political motivation for the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some individual Khilafat leaders may have had personal goals regarding social reform, the movement itself did not have a central agenda of reforming Muslim society.  The primary focus remained on protecting the Caliphate and the Ottoman Empire.  Social reform was not a core component of the movement's stated objectives.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement's program, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement advocated for the boycott of government-run educational institutions and law courts.
2.  It promoted the use of Khadi and the boycott of foreign cloth as a means of economic self-reliance.
3.  The movement initially included participation in elections to legislative councils, later abandoned due to disagreements among leaders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Non-Cooperation Movement actively promoted the boycott of British institutions, including educational institutions and law courts, as a form of non-violent resistance.  This boycott was a significant aspect of the movement's strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. The promotion of Khadi (hand-spun cloth) and the boycott of foreign cloth were central to the movement's economic program. This aimed to promote Indian industries and reduce dependence on British goods.  This aspect of the movement is often highlighted as a means of achieving economic self-sufficiency.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Non-Cooperation Movement initially *excluded* participation in elections to legislative councils. This was a point of contention among some leaders but was not initially part of the movement's program.  The decision to boycott councils was a deliberate strategy to distance the movement from British institutions.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the historical context.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the post-World War I era in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The economic hardship faced by Indians after World War I stemmed primarily from a sharp increase in industrial production, leading to oversupply and price crashes.
2. The Rowlatt Act, enacted in 1919, significantly curtailed civil liberties and fueled widespread discontent.
3. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1919 fully satisfied the Indian demand for self-governance, leading to a period of political stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The post-World War I era in India saw a sharp *decrease* in industrial production, coupled with a rise in prices, leading to severe economic hardship.  The war-time boom ended, and the sudden influx of cheaper British goods devastated Indian industries.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, allowed the government to imprison individuals without trial for up to two years, severely restricting civil liberties and sparking widespread protests, including the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  This act is a significant example of the repressive policies of the British Raj.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing elements of self-governance (dyarchy), fell far short of satisfying the growing Indian demand for complete self-rule.  The reforms were widely seen as inadequate and fueled further nationalist aspirations.  The limited nature of the reforms and the continued British control over key areas significantly contributed to the escalating tensions.


**2. With reference to the Khilafat Movement and Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat Movement primarily focused on securing greater autonomy for Indian princely states within the British Empire.
2. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched by Mahatma Gandhi, involved a complete boycott of all British goods and services.
3.  The movements successfully cemented Hindu-Muslim unity throughout their duration, preventing any communal clashes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khilafat Movement centered on protecting the Ottoman Caliphate and protesting British actions against the Ottoman Empire after World War I.  It leveraged religious sentiment to mobilize support for wider anti-British sentiments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement involved boycotts of British institutions (schools, courts, etc.), it did not encompass a complete boycott of all British goods and services. The use of Khadi as a symbol of Swadeshi was a key element, but the boycott was selective and not absolute.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the movements initially fostered Hindu-Muslim unity, communal tensions and violence did erupt during their course, highlighting the fragility of the unity and the underlying social fault lines. The Moplah Rebellion in Malabar is a stark example of this. The failure to maintain complete unity underscores the complexities of navigating religious and political identities within a national movement.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement led to the immediate establishment of  Swaraj (self-rule) within a year, as predicted by Gandhi.
2.  The movement witnessed mass participation from diverse sections of Indian society, including peasants, workers, and students.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the suspension of the movement by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's prediction of achieving Swaraj within a year proved overly optimistic. The movement ultimately fell short of its immediate goals, though it significantly impacted the national movement's trajectory.

Statement 2 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement was notable for its broad-based participation, drawing in peasants, workers, students, and various other social groups.  This mass mobilization was a crucial aspect of its significance.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob attacked a police station, resulting in fatalities, prompted Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to his commitment to non-violent methods.  This decision, while controversial at the time, reflected his steadfast adherence to non-violence as a core principle of the struggle.


**4. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Revolutionary terrorism emerged solely as a response to the economic policies of the British Raj.
2.  The Ghadar Party, primarily comprised of Sikh soldiers and peasants, aimed to overthrow British rule through armed rebellion.
3. Bhagat Singh and his associates were primarily motivated by purely religious goals in their revolutionary activities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic exploitation was a major factor contributing to the overall discontent, revolutionary terrorism also arose from political repression, the failure of constitutional methods, and a desire for immediate independence.  It was a multifaceted response to the colonial situation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ghadar Party, with a predominantly Sikh membership but diverse leadership, aimed at an armed rebellion against British rule.  Their transnational network and mobilization efforts represent a significant aspect of the revolutionary movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bhagat Singh and his colleagues, while drawing on nationalist sentiments, were also significantly influenced by socialist and anti-imperialist ideologies. Their actions were motivated by a desire for social and economic justice, alongside national liberation.  Their revolutionary goals transcended purely religious objectives.



**5. Consider the following statements regarding the events leading up to Indian Independence:**

1. The Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 proposed the immediate creation of a fully independent Pakistan.
2.  The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt of 1946 demonstrated widespread discontent within the Indian armed forces.
3. The Indian National Congress consistently and unequivocally supported the upsurges of violent protests during the period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Mission Plan did *not* propose the immediate creation of Pakistan. It suggested a three-tiered structure with options for grouping provinces, ultimately falling short of satisfying the Muslim League's demand for a separate state.  The failure to resolve the issue of partition contributed to the escalating political crisis.

Statement 2 is correct. The RIN revolt of 1946 was a significant event showcasing the growing unrest within the Indian armed forces, adding to the pressure on the British government. The revolt demonstrated the erosion of the British Raj's authority and the rise of nationalist sentiment within its own military.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Congress benefited from the upsurge of nationalist sentiment, its official stance did not fully support the violent nature of the protests. The Congress leadership generally advocated for non-violent resistance, even while acknowledging the widespread anger and frustration fueling the actions.  The contrasting approaches highlight the internal debates within the national movement regarding strategies for achieving independence.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, though not directly related to Indian politics, strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule.
2. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee report fueled widespread Indian discontent.
3.  The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms successfully addressed Indian demands for self-government, thus contributing to the movement's relative failure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat movement, focused on the plight of the Ottoman Caliph after World War I, resonated deeply with Indian Muslims.  While not directly linked to Indian self-rule, it provided a powerful unifying factor with the Hindu nationalist movement, creating a broader anti-British front. This joint action significantly amplified the Non-Cooperation Movement's impact.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rowlatt Act, authorizing indefinite detention without trial, the brutal Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the perceived whitewash by the Hunter Committee investigating the Punjab atrocities greatly intensified anti-British sentiment across various segments of Indian society. These events created a fertile ground for widespread dissent and fueled the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced in 1919, fell far short of satisfying Indian aspirations for self-government.  The reforms' limited nature, particularly the system of dyarchy (dual governance), only heightened the sense of frustration and injustice, further motivating the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The reforms' inadequacy, rather than their success, contributed to the movement's rise.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement's programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement included the boycott of British goods, legislative councils, and government educational institutions.
2.  Gandhi's initial non-cooperation programme explicitly included mass civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes from the outset.
3. The movement successfully maintained complete non-violence throughout its duration, achieving its primary goal of Swaraj within a year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement encompassed a wide range of non-violent non-cooperation tactics.  These included boycotting British goods (especially cloth), refusing to participate in government-run educational institutions, and abstaining from elections to legislative councils.  This multi-pronged approach aimed to exert significant pressure on the British administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While mass civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes were envisioned as potential later phases of the movement, they were not part of Gandhi's initial programme in 1920. The initial focus was on non-cooperation through boycotts and withdrawal of support from British institutions. The escalation to mass civil disobedience was a later development.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Non-Cooperation Movement did not maintain complete non-violence. While Gandhi consistently emphasized non-violence, instances of violence occurred, most notably the Chauri Chaura incident, which led to Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement.  Furthermore, the movement did not achieve its goal of Swaraj within a year, falling short of its ambitious timeline.


**3. With reference to the participants and their roles in the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement but later withdrew his support.
2.  Rabindranath Tagore actively supported the burning of foreign clothes as a form of protest during the movement.
3.  Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru were among the lawyers who gave up their legal practice to participate in the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement, seeing it as a potential avenue for Hindu-Muslim unity and advancement of Indian interests. However, he later withdrew his support due to disagreements with Gandhi's approach and the increasing emphasis on mass mobilization.  His departure highlights the internal tensions and evolving political dynamics within the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rabindranath Tagore, while a prominent figure in Indian intellectual life, publicly opposed the more extreme actions of the Non-Cooperation Movement, including the burning of foreign clothes.  He believed such actions were counterproductive and went against the principles of non-violent resistance.  His opposition underscores the diverse perspectives within the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct.  Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru were among the many lawyers who gave up their lucrative legal practices to actively participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This act of sacrifice symbolized their commitment to the cause of Indian independence and their willingness to prioritize national interests over personal gain.  Their participation demonstrates the movement's ability to attract prominent figures from various sectors of society.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement (1942), consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's failure to secure a constitutional settlement directly contributed to the launch of the Quit India Movement.
2. The Quit India Resolution, moved by Jawaharlal Nehru and seconded by Sardar Patel, demanded an immediate end to British rule in India.
3. The movement was characterized by widespread non-violent civil disobedience and complete adherence to Gandhi's principles of non-violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The failure of the Cripps Mission to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Indian National Congress regarding India's future status significantly fueled the momentum for the Quit India Movement.  The mission's perceived inadequacy and the British government's unwillingness to concede substantial power intensified the Congress' resolve to demand immediate independence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Quit India Resolution, indeed moved by Jawaharlal Nehru and seconded by Sardar Patel, explicitly called for an immediate end to British rule in India.  This bold demand marked a significant escalation in the nationalist struggle and signaled the Congress' determination to achieve complete independence without further delay.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Quit India Movement was initially conceived as a non-violent movement, the arrest of Congress leaders led to widespread spontaneous protests that often turned violent.  The government's harsh repression and the lack of centralized leadership contributed to this shift, resulting in instances of sabotage, clashes with authorities, and other forms of violence.  The movement's deviation from strict non-violence is a critical aspect of its historical context.



**5.  With reference to the Indian National Army (INA) and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mohan Singh initiated the formation of the INA, recruiting Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia.
2.  Rash Behari Bose played a crucial role in establishing the Indian Independence League in Tokyo, facilitating Subhas Chandra Bose's collaboration with Japan.
3. The INA's military campaign successfully liberated a significant portion of Indian territory before its eventual surrender in 1945.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mohan Singh, an Indian officer in the British Indian Army, played a pivotal role in the early stages of the INA's formation.  He capitalized on the opportunity presented by the large number of Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese in Southeast Asia, successfully recruiting them to fight for Indian independence. His efforts laid the groundwork for the INA's later expansion and prominence.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rash Behari Bose, a veteran Indian revolutionary who had fled to Japan, made significant contributions to the INA's development.  He established the Indian Independence League in Tokyo, creating a crucial organizational and political framework for Subhas Chandra Bose's collaboration with the Japanese.  His networking and diplomatic efforts were essential in securing Japanese support for the INA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INA did make some advances into Indian territory, notably reaching Moirang in Manipur, its military campaign ultimately failed to liberate any significant portion of India.  The INA's efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, the changing tide of the war in favor of the Allies, and the Japanese army's own strategic setbacks. The INA's defeat alongside Japan's surrender marked the end of its military campaign.



**6. With reference to the post-Non-Cooperation Movement period (1922 onwards), consider the following statements regarding the Swarajists and No-Changers:**

1. The Swarajists, led by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for entering legislative councils to obstruct government policies and mobilize public support.
2. The No-Changers, including Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad, emphasized constructive work and opposed participation in legislative councils.
3. The Swarajist strategy proved highly effective in achieving immediate self-governance, leading to a rapid transfer of power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Following the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru led the Swarajist faction within the Congress, advocating for a shift in strategy.  They argued that entering legislative councils, even under limited powers, provided a platform to obstruct government legislation, expose its weaknesses, and ultimately mobilize public support for the nationalist cause.  This approach represented a divergence from Gandhi's focus on mass mobilization.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The No-Changers, a faction within the Congress led by figures like Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad, strongly opposed the Swarajists' council-entry strategy.  They believed that participation in legislative councils would compromise the nationalist movement's integrity and divert attention from constructive work aimed at grassroots mobilization and self-reliance.  Their emphasis on constructive programs highlights a different approach to achieving self-rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swarajist strategy, while achieving some successes in legislative councils, did not lead to immediate self-governance or a rapid transfer of power.  Their efforts primarily focused on obstructionist tactics and raising public awareness, not on directly challenging British authority or securing major constitutional concessions.  The achievement of independence required a much broader and longer struggle.


**7. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation that successfully brought together British Indian provinces and princely states.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy.
3. The Act fully granted self-governance to India, paving the way for immediate independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did propose an All-India Federation, which would have included both British Indian provinces and princely states. However, this federation never materialized due to the failure to secure the participation of a sufficient number of princely states.  The Act's inability to achieve federation highlights the limitations of constitutional reforms in addressing the central issue of Indian self-rule.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant feature of the 1935 Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy. This replaced the earlier system of dyarchy (dual governance), granting provinces greater control over their internal affairs.  Provincial autonomy, while not granting full self-governance, represented a step towards greater Indian participation in administration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 1935 Act did not grant self-governance to India. While it introduced significant constitutional changes, it retained substantial British control over key areas like defense and foreign affairs.  The Act's limitations fueled continued nationalist demands for complete independence and did not lead to immediate self-rule.  The Act's provisions ultimately served as a temporary structure that lasted until the end of World War II.


**8. With reference to the debates within the Indian National Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement (1934-1937), consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance (joining provincial governments) but later relented, seeing it as a strategic maneuver.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose strongly supported office acceptance, believing it essential for effective governance and social reform.
3.  The Congress's decision to contest the 1937 provincial elections was preceded by a significant internal debate on the strategy of office acceptance or rejection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In the aftermath of the Civil Disobedience Movement, there was significant debate within the Congress regarding the future strategy. Gandhi initially opposed the idea of Congress leaders accepting office in provincial governments, fearing that it might compromise the nationalist movement's revolutionary character. However, later he changed his stance, seeing office acceptance as a potential tool to influence governance and advance the cause of self-rule. This change in attitude reflects a pragmatic approach to navigating the complexities of the political landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose were initially strongly opposed to office acceptance.  They believed that participating in the provincial governments established under the 1935 Act would legitimize a system that fundamentally denied India's right to self-determination.  Their opposition highlights the ideological differences within the Congress regarding the best path toward independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Congress's decision to participate in the 1937 provincial elections was indeed preceded by considerable internal debate on the question of office acceptance.  This debate reflected the fundamental ideological differences within the Congress regarding the most effective strategy for achieving independence.  Some favored a continued focus on mass movements and non-cooperation, while others believed that engaging with the existing political system could be a strategic advantage.  The resolution of this internal struggle shaped the Congress's approach to the elections and its subsequent role in provincial governments.


**9. With reference to the differences between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Bose advocated for a militant approach to achieving independence, contrasting with Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance.
2. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II reflected his pragmatism, prioritizing the achievement of independence over ideological alignment.
3. Both Gandhi and Bose shared similar views on the importance of religion in public life and the role of the State in society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A fundamental difference between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi lay in their approach to achieving Indian independence.  Bose believed that a more militant and assertive approach, potentially involving armed struggle, was necessary to dislodge British rule.  Gandhi, on the other hand, championed non-violent resistance (Satyagraha) as the most effective and morally justifiable means of achieving self-rule. This difference in approach reflects contrasting philosophies of political action.

Statement 2 is also correct. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers (Germany and Japan) during World War II is a complex and controversial aspect of his life.  However, it can be interpreted as a reflection of his pragmatism.  He prioritized the achievement of Indian independence, seeing an opportunity to exploit the weakening of British power during the war.  His alliance with the Axis powers, despite their ideologies, demonstrates a strategic calculation to achieve his ultimate goal.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While both Gandhi and Bose were influenced by Indian religious and philosophical traditions, their views on the role of religion in public life and the ideal form of the state differed significantly.  Gandhi's vision of society was deeply rooted in his religious beliefs, while Bose, while respectful of religious traditions, advocated for a secular state.  Their contrasting perspectives on the relationship between religion and politics highlight a significant divergence in their worldviews.


**10. With reference to the Poona Pact (1932), consider the following statements:**

1.  The pact resolved the conflict between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar over the issue of separate electorates for the depressed classes.
2.  The pact resulted in the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes, but increased reserved seats for them in legislatures.
3. The pact was universally welcomed by all Indian political groups, immediately resolving the issue of minority representation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Poona Pact directly addressed the conflict between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, who represented the depressed classes.  The conflict centered on the issue of separate electorates for the depressed classes, as proposed in the Communal Award.  Gandhi's fast unto death played a crucial role in pressuring Ambedkar to negotiate a compromise.  The pact represents a significant moment of negotiation and compromise within the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Poona Pact ultimately resolved the conflict by abandoning the system of separate electorates for the depressed classes.  However, it did increase the number of reserved seats allocated for them in both provincial and central legislatures.  This compromise attempted to balance the demands for representation with the broader goal of maintaining national unity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Poona Pact averted a potentially disastrous conflict, it did not achieve universal acceptance among all Indian political groups.  Some groups continued to express reservations about the compromise, highlighting the complexities of minority representation and the enduring challenges of caste politics within the Indian social structure.  The pact, while significant, did not entirely resolve the issue of minority representation.


**1. With reference to the ideological differences between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Bose advocated for an immediate mass struggle for independence, leveraging the international crisis, while Gandhi believed the time was not ripe due to internal divisions and unpreparedness.
2.  Gandhi's Ramrajya envisioned a stateless society based on self-governance and moral enlightenment, contrasting with Bose's inclination towards a potentially authoritarian state for initial nation-building.
3. Both Gandhi and Bose supported socialist ideals, but differed on their approach: Gandhi favoured decentralized village economies and rejected Western-style socialism, while Bose championed industrialization and state control of key industries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the core ideological differences between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi.  Statement 1 highlights their contrasting approaches to the timing and method of the freedom struggle. Bose's impatience and belief in seizing opportunities during the international crisis clashed with Gandhi's emphasis on internal unity and preparedness before launching a major movement.  Statement 2 correctly contrasts their visions of the ideal state. Gandhi's Ramrajya was a utopian vision of a stateless society governed by morality and self-rule, a stark contrast to Bose's pragmatic view that an initial authoritarian structure might be necessary for rapid nation-building and addressing poverty and social inequality.  Statement 3 accurately captures their shared belief in socialism while emphasizing their differing approaches. Gandhi's vision of socialism was rooted in decentralized village industries and a rejection of Western industrial models, while Bose advocated for industrialization and state-led economic planning, drawing inspiration from the Soviet model.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its impact on the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission proposed dominion status for India, with the option for provinces to secede and form separate unions, a significant departure from previous proposals.
2.  The Congress's rejection of the Cripps Mission stemmed primarily from its offer of dominion status instead of complete independence and the right of provinces to secede, which threatened national unity.
3. The Muslim League's opposition to the Cripps Mission was based on its failure to explicitly offer the creation of Pakistan and concerns about the proposed constituent assembly's structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Cripps Mission and its reception by major Indian political forces. Statement 1 correctly points out the key feature of the Cripps proposal: the offer of dominion status with the option for provinces to secede and form independent unions. This was a significant departure from prior offers and laid the groundwork for the eventual partition of India. Statement 2 accurately captures the Congress's primary objections. The offer of dominion status, rather than complete independence, was unacceptable, and the provision for provincial secession directly challenged the Congress's vision of a unified India. Statement 3 accurately describes the Muslim League's position.  The League's main objections were the lack of explicit mention of Pakistan and concerns about the structure and process of the proposed constituent assembly.  Therefore, the correct option is (c) as all three statements are accurate reflections of historical events.


**3. With reference to the political ideologies of Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bose's admiration for the discipline and organization of Fascist and Nazi regimes, despite his opposition to their ideologies, influenced his strategic choices in the freedom struggle.
2. Gandhi's concept of Swaraj emphasized self-governance at the individual and community levels, advocating for a decentralized political and economic system.
3. Bose believed that violence was the only effective means to achieve complete independence for India, while Gandhi remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violence as both a means and an end.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the contrasting political ideologies of Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi. Statement 1 correctly points to Bose's pragmatic approach. While vehemently opposing the racist and authoritarian aspects of Nazism and Fascism, Bose admired their organizational discipline and efficiency, a factor that influenced his strategic alliances during World War II.  Statement 2 accurately describes Gandhi's vision of Swaraj.  His concept went beyond mere political independence and encompassed self-rule at the individual and community levels, advocating for a decentralized political and economic system rooted in village republics. Statement 3 accurately highlights their fundamental difference on the use of violence. Bose believed that violent resistance was necessary to overthrow British rule, contrasting sharply with Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence as both a means and an end in the freedom struggle.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all three statements are accurate representations of their respective ideologies.


**4. With reference to the post-independence challenges faced by India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Radcliffe Boundary Award, hastily drawn with limited knowledge of local conditions, resulted in widespread communal violence and displacement of populations on both sides of the border.
2. The division of resources and assets between India and Pakistan, including financial assets, defense personnel, and equipment, led to significant tensions and disputes.
3. The rehabilitation and resettlement of millions of refugees who were displaced due to partition posed a massive administrative and logistical challenge for the newly independent nation, particularly in East Punjab and Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly identify significant challenges faced by India immediately after independence. Statement 1 accurately describes the problems created by the Radcliffe Boundary Award.  The rushed demarcation of the border, based on incomplete data and without adequate consideration for local realities, fueled widespread communal violence and displacement of massive populations, particularly in Punjab and Bengal. Statement 2 correctly points to the difficulties arising from the division of resources. The partition led to complex and contentious issues concerning the division of financial assets, defense personnel, and equipment, causing significant tensions between India and Pakistan.  Statement 3 accurately highlights the massive refugee crisis. The partition resulted in the displacement of millions of people, creating a huge challenge for the new Indian government in terms of providing relief, rehabilitation, and resettlement.  Therefore, the correct option is (c), as all three statements accurately reflect the significant post-partition challenges faced by India.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Moderates, while advocating for constitutional reforms, believed in gradual progress through persuasion and constitutional means, rather than direct confrontation with the British.
2. The early nationalists, including Dadabhai Naoroji and R.C. Dutt, developed the ‘drain theory’ to expose the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while increasing the number of Indian members in legislative councils, still retained the official majority, limiting the effectiveness of Indian representation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate regarding the early nationalist movement in India. Statement 1 correctly characterizes the Moderate approach. The Moderates, unlike the later Extremists, favored a gradual and constitutional approach to achieving self-government, relying on persuasion and appeals to the British government and public opinion rather than direct confrontation. Statement 2 accurately describes the ‘drain theory’.  Prominent early nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji and R.C. Dutt meticulously analyzed the British economic policies and developed the ‘drain theory’ to highlight the systematic transfer of wealth from India to Britain.  Statement 3 accurately assesses the Indian Councils Act of 1892.  The Act did increase Indian representation in legislative councils, but it crucially maintained the official majority, significantly limiting the influence and effectiveness of Indian members in challenging British policies. Therefore, option (c) is correct, as all three statements accurately reflect aspects of the early nationalist movement.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for a socialist future for India, although their interpretations of socialism differed significantly.
2.  Bose openly admired the discipline of Fascist and Nazi regimes, while Gandhi vehemently opposed their ideologies.
3.  Gandhi's vision of Ramrajya emphasized a stateless society, while Bose, in his later years, envisioned an initially authoritarian state for nation-building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the ideological divergence between Gandhi and Bose.  Statement 1 highlights their shared socialist leanings, but emphasizes the crucial difference in their approaches.  Gandhi's socialism was rooted in village self-sufficiency and non-violent resistance, while Bose, influenced by modern industrialization and nation-building models, initially envisioned a more centralized and potentially authoritarian state to achieve rapid economic progress. Statement 2 correctly points out Bose's pragmatic admiration for the discipline of Fascist and Nazi regimes, contrasting sharply with Gandhi's firm rejection of their totalitarian ideologies.  While Bose sought to utilize their organizational strengths strategically, he did not endorse their racial policies. Statement 3 correctly contrasts Gandhi's utopian vision of Ramrajya—a decentralized, stateless society based on morality and self-governance—with Bose's pragmatic belief that a more structured, potentially authoritarian state might be necessary in the initial stages of independent India's development.  The differences in their approaches to achieving independence and their visions for the future governance of India are central to understanding their contrasting legacies.


**2. With reference to the Congress' response to World War II, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress Working Committee's Wardha resolution unconditionally supported Britain's war effort, believing the Allied cause to be just.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose and leftist members of the Congress advocated for leveraging Britain's wartime difficulties to launch a mass movement for independence.
3.  Jawaharlal Nehru, while recognizing the imperialist nature of the war, opposed exploiting Britain's vulnerabilities for immediate action, preferring a conditional approach towards supporting the war effort.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Wardha resolution did *not* unconditionally support the war effort. It was conditional on Britain granting India substantial power and independence after the war.  Gandhi, while personally sympathetic to Britain due to his anti-fascist stance, initially favored conditional support.  The Congress's stance was a complex balancing act between opposing fascism and pursuing India's independence. Statement 2 accurately reflects Bose's and the leftists' perspective. They believed Britain's vulnerability during the war presented a unique opportunity to launch a decisive struggle for independence, rather than offering conditional support.  They saw the war as an imperialist conflict, regardless of the participants. Statement 3 correctly describes Nehru's position. He recognized the war's imperialist dimensions but opposed taking immediate advantage of Britain's weaknesses.  He advocated for a conditional approach, linking Indian participation to concrete steps towards independence, while avoiding actions that might undermine the Allied war effort.  The differing responses within the Congress highlight the internal tensions and diverse strategies within the nationalist movement during this critical period.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission's proposals explicitly offered complete independence to India after the war.
2.  The Congress's rejection of the Cripps Mission was primarily due to its offer of dominion status instead of complete independence and the right of provinces to secede.
3.  The Muslim League welcomed the Cripps Mission, viewing it as a step toward the creation of Pakistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission offered dominion status, not complete independence, after the war. While the proposal implied a path towards eventual independence, the immediate offer was dominion status within the Commonwealth, a point of major contention for the Congress. Statement 2 is correct. The Congress's rejection stemmed from several key factors, including the offer of dominion status rather than immediate independence, the provision for provinces to secede (which threatened national unity), and the lack of a clear plan for immediate power transfer.  These concerns reflected the Congress's commitment to complete self-determination and a unified India. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League's response was more nuanced. While it initially seemed welcoming, the League ultimately had significant reservations about the proposals, primarily because the plan didn't explicitly address the creation of Pakistan and because of concerns about the proposed machinery for the creation of the Constituent Assembly. The League's position ultimately highlighted the growing divide between the Congress and the Muslim League. The failure of the Cripps Mission underscored the deepening political chasm and the insurmountable difficulties in achieving a unified vision for India's future.


**4. With reference to Gandhi and Bose's views on women's role in society, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for women's emancipation and opposed social practices like purdah.
2.  Gandhi's view of women's role emphasized their traditional role as homemakers, while Bose championed their equal participation in all aspects of national life, including military service.
3.  Bose established a women's regiment in the Indian National Army (INA), demonstrating his commitment to women's active role in the freedom struggle.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Both Gandhi and Bose were proponents of women's emancipation, but their approaches differed substantially. While both opposed practices like purdah, the extent of their commitment to women's participation in public life differed significantly.  Gandhi, while advocating for women's rights, viewed their primary role as homemakers, although he championed their participation in the freedom struggle. Statement 2 correctly highlights this contrast. Gandhi, despite advocating for women's rights, held more traditional views on their primary role in society, whereas Bose firmly believed in gender equality and active women's participation in all areas of life, including military service. This difference reflects their differing perspectives on social reform and the role of women in nation-building. Statement 3 is correct. Bose's formation of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in the INA demonstrates his commitment to integrating women fully into the freedom struggle, going beyond mere symbolic participation. This action stands in stark contrast to Gandhi's more cautious approach to women's involvement in active combat roles. The contrasting views of Gandhi and Bose on women's roles highlight the complexities of gender dynamics within the Indian nationalist movement and the spectrum of opinions regarding social reform during that era.


**5. With reference to the post-Non-Cooperation Movement period and the emergence of new political forces, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajist Party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for a complete boycott of legislative councils, believing participation would compromise the nationalist struggle.
2.  The No-Changers, led by figures like Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad, focused on constructive work and continued to advocate for non-cooperation with the colonial government.
3.  The rise of socialist and communist ideologies in India during this period was significantly influenced by the Russian Revolution and the activities of the Comintern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2, 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swarajist Party, contrary to the statement, advocated for entering legislative councils to utilize them as platforms for political struggle and to expose the weaknesses of the colonial system.  Their strategy of "end or mend" aimed at either forcing reforms or disrupting the functioning of the councils from within. Statement 2 is correct. The No-Changers, indeed, focused on constructive work, emphasizing activities like khadi production, national education, and social reform, while maintaining their commitment to non-cooperation with the colonial government. Their approach emphasized building a strong grassroots movement through various social initiatives. Statement 3 is correct. The Russian Revolution and the Comintern's activities played a pivotal role in introducing and popularizing Marxist and communist ideas in India. These ideologies resonated with many Indians who sought radical solutions to India's social and economic problems, impacting the political landscape significantly.  The emergence of these diverse political forces during this period reflects the complex interplay of different ideologies and strategies within the Indian nationalist movement.  The divergence between Swarajists and No-Changers demonstrates the internal debates and evolving approaches to the freedom struggle.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, though not directly related to Indian politics, strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule.
2. The Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre fueled widespread discontent and contributed to the movement's impetus.
3.  The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms successfully addressed Indian demands for self-government, thus mitigating the need for the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat movement, focused on the plight of the Ottoman Caliph after World War I, resonated deeply with Indian Muslims.  Its alignment with the Non-Cooperation Movement fostered a crucial period of Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule, a key factor in the movement's success.  However, this unity was ultimately fragile and didn't last beyond the movement's conclusion.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rowlatt Act, authorizing detention without trial, and the horrific Jallianwala Bagh massacre exemplified the brutal nature of British rule, igniting widespread anger and resentment among Indians. These events significantly contributed to the atmosphere of defiance that fueled the Non-Cooperation Movement. The lack of justice and accountability for these actions further solidified anti-British sentiment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing some limited self-government (dyarchy), fell far short of satisfying Indian aspirations for substantial autonomy.  The reforms' shortcomings, perceived as inadequate and insufficient, actually contributed to the growing dissatisfaction that culminated in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The reforms' failure to address core grievances fueled the movement's momentum rather than diminishing it.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement's impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement resulted in increased Hindu-Muslim unity, lasting well into the 1930s.
2. It led to a significant expansion of elected members in the Central Legislative Assembly.
3. The movement saw the establishment of numerous national educational institutions as alternatives to government-run schools and colleges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement did initially foster a degree of Hindu-Muslim unity, this was short-lived and ultimately fractured due to various socio-political factors. The unity was instrumental in the movement's early success but didn't endure as a long-term outcome.  Communal tensions and differences in political goals ultimately undermined the initial unity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement did not directly lead to a significant increase in elected members in the Central Legislative Assembly.  The movement focused on non-cooperation with the British government, including boycotting legislative councils.  Changes in the composition of the Assembly came about through later constitutional reforms.

Statement 3 is correct.  A significant outcome of the Non-Cooperation Movement was the establishment of numerous national educational institutions, such as Jamia Millia Islamia, Kashi Vidyapeeth, and Gujarat Vidyapeeth. These institutions were created as alternatives to government-run schools and colleges, reflecting a broader movement to create parallel systems outside British control and promote Indian nationalism.  This aspect of the movement highlights its broader socio-cultural impact beyond just political action.



**3. With reference to the Simon Commission and the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The Simon Commission, appointed in 1927, included Indian members to ensure representation of diverse viewpoints.
2. The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, unequivocally advocated for complete independence as the goal of the Indian National Congress.
3.  The Simon Commission's recommendations were largely accepted by the Indian National Congress and led to significant constitutional reforms before the 1935 Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Simon Commission was entirely composed of British members, which led to widespread protests in India.  The absence of Indian representation was a major point of contention and a key reason for the boycott of the commission.  The all-British composition of the commission highlighted the British government's unwillingness to fully engage with Indian political leaders on an equal footing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nehru Report was a significant attempt to draft a constitution for India, it did not unequivocally advocate for complete independence.  It primarily proposed dominion status, although there was some internal debate within the committee about the ultimate goal of independence.  The report reflected the internal disagreements within the Indian National Congress regarding the pace and nature of political progress.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Simon Commission's recommendations were largely rejected by the Indian National Congress. The Congress, along with other major nationalist groups, boycotted the commission and its report due to its all-British composition and perceived inadequacy.  The 1935 Act, while incorporating some aspects of the discussions that followed the Simon Commission, was ultimately a product of the broader political context and not a direct result of the Commission's recommendations.  The Congress's rejection of the Simon Commission played a significant role in shaping the subsequent political landscape.



**4. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "No-Changers" faction advocated for continued boycott of legislative councils and a focus on constructive work.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru strongly supported the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy advocated by Gandhi.
3. The Congress's decision to contest the 1937 provincial elections was based on a complete acceptance of the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "No-Changers" within the Indian National Congress opposed participation in legislative councils and emphasized the importance of constructive work, such as khadi production and social reform, as a means to strengthen the nationalist movement. This faction prioritized non-cooperation with the British government and focused on building grassroots support for future mass movements.  Their approach reflected a more radical and less compromising stance compared to the "Swarajists."

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jawaharlal Nehru was critical of Gandhi's "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy. Nehru advocated for a more continuous and less intermittent approach to the struggle for independence, arguing that a constant confrontation with imperialism was necessary to achieve the goal of complete independence. His perspective reflected a more radical and socialist outlook.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Congress's decision to contest the 1937 provincial elections was not based on an acceptance of the Government of India Act, 1935.  The Congress's participation was strategic, aiming to utilize the electoral process to further its goals of self-governance while maintaining its opposition to the Act itself.  The Congress sought to use its electoral success to build political pressure and ultimately challenge the colonial government from within the existing system.  The decision reflected a complex balancing act between participating in the existing system and maintaining its commitment to complete independence.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent federal structure for India, granting complete autonomy to the provinces.
2. The Act introduced a bicameral legislature at the center, with the Council of States having a larger number of members than the Federal Assembly.
3. The Act significantly expanded the franchise, enfranchising a substantial portion of the Indian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, did not establish a fully independent federal structure for India.  It proposed a federal system, but it retained significant powers for the Governor-General and included numerous safeguards that limited Indian autonomy. The federal structure was never fully implemented because of the princely states' reluctance to join. The Act's provisions reflected the British government's desire to retain substantial control over Indian affairs while making some concessions to Indian demands.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act introduced a bicameral legislature at the center, but the Council of States (upper house) did *not* have a larger number of members than the Federal Assembly (lower house). The Federal Assembly had a larger number of members, reflecting the greater democratic representation sought by the British.  The composition of the legislature reflected the complex power dynamics between the British government and Indian political groups.

Statement 3 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, significantly expanded the franchise, enfranchising a larger proportion of the Indian population compared to previous acts.  While still a limited franchise, this expansion was a step towards greater democratic participation and had a significant impact on the political landscape.  The expanded franchise allowed for a larger number of Indians to participate in the 1937 provincial elections, significantly altering the political dynamics.


**6. With reference to the Princely States during the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, worked to promote complete independence for the princely states.
2.  The All India States' Peoples' Conference actively advocated for democratic rights and popular governments within the princely states.
3. The Congress consistently opposed the integration of princely states into independent India after 1947.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes, established by the British, was designed to coordinate the policies of the princely states and to act as a counterweight to the growing Indian nationalist movement.  It did not advocate for independence of the princely states but rather for their continued relationship with the British government. The Chamber reflected the British strategy of using the princely states to contain the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The All India States' Peoples' Conference played a crucial role in advocating for democratic reforms and self-governance within the princely states.  This organization represented the interests of the people living within the princely states and actively worked to challenge the autocratic rule of the princes.  The Conference's activities demonstrate the broader nationalist sentiment that extended beyond British India and encompassed the princely states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Congress, after initially focusing on the independence of British India, eventually included the integration of the princely states into independent India as a key goal.  The Congress actively worked towards the integration of the princely states into the newly independent nation, recognizing that their continued existence as separate entities would undermine national unity and stability. This policy reflected the Congress's commitment to a unified and independent India.


**7. With reference to the growth of communalism in India during the period leading up to partition, consider the following statements:**

1. The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan was first formally articulated in 1940.
2. The Hindu Mahasabha actively promoted the concept of a separate nation for Hindus.
3. The Congress consistently failed to win a significant number of seats reserved for minorities in the provincial elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore Resolution of 1940, passed by the Muslim League, formally proposed the creation of Pakistan as a separate Muslim state. This resolution marked a significant turning point in the political landscape of India and laid the groundwork for the partition of the country.  The Lahore Resolution signaled the Muslim League's definitive shift towards demanding a separate state for Indian Muslims.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist organization, expressed views that mirrored the Muslim League's separatist tendencies.  While not explicitly advocating for a separate Hindu state in the same way as the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha promoted a Hindu-centric view of Indian nationalism and often worked against efforts to accommodate the concerns of minority groups.  The Hindu Mahasabha's rhetoric contributed to the growing communal polarization in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Congress, despite its commitment to inclusive nationalism, consistently struggled to win a significant number of seats reserved for minorities in the provincial elections. This failure contributed to the rise of communal politics and further fueled the demands for separate representation and ultimately, partition.  The Congress's inability to effectively mobilize minority support demonstrated the limitations of its inclusive approach in the face of growing communal divisions.


**8. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early phase (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a significant role in the founding of the Indian National Congress.
2. The early Congress primarily focused on armed rebellion against British rule.
3.  Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and other early leaders advocated for self-government on the lines of the self-governing British colonies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress. While his motivations are debated, his efforts in bringing together prominent Indian leaders were instrumental in the Congress's establishment.  Hume's involvement highlights the complex interplay between British officials and Indian nationalists in the early stages of the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian National Congress was characterized by constitutional and non-violent methods of political action.  The early Congress leaders primarily focused on petitions, resolutions, and constitutional agitation within the existing political framework.  Armed rebellion was not the primary focus of the early Congress.  The emphasis on constitutional methods reflected the pragmatic approach of the early nationalist leaders.

Statement 3 is correct.  By the beginning of the 20th century, leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale began advocating for self-government in India, drawing parallels to the self-governing colonies of the British Empire. This shift towards demanding greater autonomy marked a significant evolution in the Congress's political objectives. The demand for self-government reflected the growing confidence and maturity of the Indian nationalist movement.


**9. With reference to the Indian National Congress's response to World War II, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress initially supported the British war effort unconditionally.
2. The Cripps Mission, sent to India in 1942, successfully negotiated a complete transfer of power to Indian hands.
3.  The Congress launched the Quit India Movement in response to the failure of the Cripps Mission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Congress did not initially support the British war effort unconditionally.  While the Congress was sympathetic to the fight against fascism, it made its support conditional on India being granted greater autonomy or independence.  The Congress's conditional support reflected its commitment to Indian self-determination.  The Congress leaders believed that an enslaved nation could not effectively aid in the fight for freedom elsewhere.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission, while offering some concessions towards self-government after the war, failed to achieve a complete transfer of power to Indian hands.  The mission's proposals were considered insufficient by the Congress, leading to the breakdown of negotiations. The Cripps Mission's failure reflected the enduring differences between British and Indian political goals.

Statement 3 is correct. The failure of the Cripps Mission to meet the Congress's demands for a substantial transfer of power led to the launch of the Quit India Movement in 1942. This mass movement represented a significant escalation of the struggle for independence and demonstrated the Congress's determination to achieve freedom from British rule. The Quit India Movement marked a decisive shift in the struggle for independence, showcasing the Congress's resolve to secure freedom from British rule.


**10.  With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dandi March was primarily focused on protesting against the high taxes imposed on cotton textiles.
2.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact led to the immediate and complete grant of independence to India.
3.  The movement witnessed significant participation from women, students, and various sections of the Indian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dandi March, a pivotal event in the Civil Disobedience Movement, primarily focused on protesting the British government's salt tax and its monopoly on salt production.  The salt tax was a particularly significant grievance as it affected a wide section of the population, especially the poor.  The symbolic nature of the salt tax made it an effective rallying point for the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, while representing a significant step in the negotiations between the Congress and the British government, did not lead to the immediate and complete grant of independence to India.  The Pact resulted in a temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and Congress's participation in the Second Round Table Conference.  The Pact, while achieving some concessions, did not resolve the core issue of Indian independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Civil Disobedience Movement saw widespread participation from women, students, and various sections of the Indian population.  The movement's success was largely due to the mass mobilization of people from different social groups, highlighting the movement's inclusive and widespread nature.  The participation of women and students was particularly significant, demonstrating the movement's capacity to mobilize diverse segments of society.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the Swarajist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajist Party, formed after the Gaya session of the Congress in 1922, advocated for the complete boycott of legislative councils.
2.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were prominent leaders of the Swarajist faction, initially opposing Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement.
3.  The Swarajists' strategy involved entering legislative councils to obstruct government functioning and expose its weaknesses, a tactic later termed 'ending or mending'.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swarajist Party, formed after the Gaya session of the Congress (December 1922), *opposed* the complete boycott of legislative councils. Their core strategy was to enter these councils, not boycott them.  Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were key figures in advocating for council entry, initially differing from Gandhi's approach. Their strategy aimed to "end or mend" the councils from within through obstruction and exposure of governmental flaws. This approach differed significantly from the "No-Changers" who favored continued non-cooperation and constructive work.  The Swarajists' actions represent a significant shift in Indian nationalist strategy during the interregnum between major mass movements. Their participation in the legislative process, albeit with a confrontational approach, marked a new phase in the struggle for independence.

**2. With reference to the No-Changers during the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  The No-Changers, led by figures like Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad, wholeheartedly supported the Swarajists' decision to enter legislative councils.
2.  Their primary focus was on constructive work, including promoting khadi, national education, and Hindu-Muslim unity, while maintaining the boycott of legislative councils.
3.  The No-Change philosophy emphasized gradual constitutional reforms as the primary path to Swaraj.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The No-Changers strongly *opposed* the Swarajists' decision to enter legislative councils, believing it would dilute the nationalist movement's focus and potentially lead to corruption. Statement 2 is correct. The No-Changers prioritized constructive work as a means of strengthening the national movement and preparing for future mass struggles.  Their emphasis was on grassroots mobilization and social reform, not parliamentary politics. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the No-Changers were not against constitutional reforms, their primary focus was not on gradual, constitutional change. Their strategy was fundamentally different from the Swarajists', emphasizing mass mobilization and social reform over participation in the colonial legislative system.  The No-Changers' approach highlights the diverse strategies within the Indian nationalist movement and the debate over the most effective path towards independence.


**3. With reference to the early 20th-century socialist and communist movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Communist Party of India (CPI) was founded in 1920 in Moscow, under the direct guidance of the Comintern.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose were prominent figures within the Congress who were significantly influenced by Marxist and socialist ideologies, advocating for Purna Swaraj.
3.  The Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case of 1924 involved the arrest and trial of several prominent trade unionists and communists, significantly impacting the early communist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the CPI's formation was influenced by the Comintern, its founding was in Tashkent (now in Uzbekistan), not Moscow. The timing is also slightly off, with  founding activities spanning across different locations and times. Statement 2 is correct.  Nehru and Bose were key figures within the Congress who embraced socialist and Marxist ideas, advocating for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and critiquing Gandhian methods.  Statement 3 is correct. The Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case (1924) saw the arrest of several prominent communists and trade unionists, marking a significant event in the early development of the communist movement in India.  The case highlighted the government's crackdown on communist activities and the growing influence of socialist and communist ideologies within the broader Indian nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The HRA, founded in 1928, was primarily focused on achieving complete independence through non-violent means.
2.  The Kakori train robbery in 1925 was a significant action undertaken by the HRA, leading to the arrest and execution of several key members.
3.  Bhagat Singh's assassination of John Saunders was a pivotal event in the HSRA’s shift towards a focus on mass mobilization rather than individual acts of violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HRA, founded in 1924 (not 1928), was explicitly committed to armed revolution and overthrowing the colonial government, not non-violent methods.  Statement 2 is correct. The Kakori train robbery (1925) was a key event for the HRA, leading to widespread arrests and executions.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the assassination of John Saunders (1928) was undertaken by Bhagat Singh and his associates, it did not mark a shift towards mass mobilization.  The HSRA, formed after the Kakori setback, initially continued with targeted assassinations before shifting towards a broader strategy that included mass mobilization, but the Saunders assassination itself was not indicative of this later shift. The evolution of the HRA/HSRA demonstrates the complexities of revolutionary nationalism in India, the interplay between individual action and mass mobilization, and the shifting ideological influences on the movement.  The organization’s trajectory reflects the internal debates and evolving strategies within revolutionary circles.


**5. With reference to the Chittagong Armoury Raid, consider the following statements:**

1. The raid, led by Surya Sen in 1932, was a complete failure, resulting in minimal impact on the revolutionary movement.
2.  The Chittagong group, under Surya Sen, was primarily composed of Hindu revolutionaries, reflecting the limited participation of Muslims in the revolutionary movement at that time.
3.  The raid involved the capture of significant arms and ammunition, briefly establishing a provisional revolutionary government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chittagong Armoury Raid (April 1930, not 1932) was a significant event, although it was eventually suppressed. Its impact on the revolutionary movement, particularly in inspiring young people to join the cause, was substantial. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Surya Sen was a key figure, the Chittagong group included a notable number of Muslim revolutionaries, demonstrating a degree of Hindu-Muslim cooperation within the revolutionary movement.  Statement 3 is correct. The raid successfully captured arms and ammunition, and the revolutionaries briefly declared a provisional government, although this was short-lived. The Chittagong Armoury Raid showcases the daring actions of Indian revolutionaries and the significant role played by women in the movement.  The event also highlights the diverse composition of revolutionary groups and their willingness to challenge the British directly, even with limited resources.


**6. With reference to the debates within the Indian National Congress after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement (1934-35), consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru strongly advocated for the continuation of the Civil Disobedience Movement as the primary method of struggle, rejecting both constructive work and council entry.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed council entry, but later allowed Congressmen to participate in elections to the Central Legislature, viewing it as a supplementary activity.
3.  The socialists and communists within the Congress largely supported Gandhi's position of immediate mass satyagraha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While Nehru did not completely reject all forms of political activity, he was critical of the emphasis on constructive work and council entry as substitutes for mass action and viewed them as potentially diverting resources from the main goal of independence. Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi, initially opposed to council entry, later permitted it as a secondary strategy, recognizing the need to maintain political activity during a period of relative inactivity.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Socialists and communists within the Congress largely opposed Gandhi's preference for a period of relative inactivity before launching another mass movement; they advocated for a more continuous struggle.  The post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Congress reflect the tension between different strategic approaches to the freedom struggle.  The divergence of opinions highlights the ideological diversity within the nationalist movement and the challenge of maintaining unity while pursuing different paths to independence.



**7.  With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established a fully independent Indian Federation, granting complete self-governance to all provinces.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the system of dyarchy and granting significant powers to provincial legislatures.
3. The Act fully conceded the Congress's demand for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act did *not* establish a fully independent Indian Federation. The proposed federation was conditional upon the accession of princely states, which did not materialize.  The central government retained significant control, and the Act included various safeguards that limited Indian autonomy.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy.  Provincial legislatures were granted greater control over provincial affairs. However, governors retained considerable powers, particularly concerning law and order and minority interests. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act did not fully concede the Congress's demand for a constituent assembly. While it outlined a process for constitutional reform, it did not grant the power to draft a constitution for a fully independent India to an assembly elected by the Indian people. The Government of India Act, 1935, represents a complex piece of legislation that attempted to balance British interests with the growing demands for Indian self-governance.  Its provisions were a source of both hope and frustration for Indian nationalists, contributing to the continued struggle for independence.


**8. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mission offered complete independence to India immediately upon its conclusion.
2.  The mission proposed a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution for India, with representation from both British India and the princely states.
3.  The Congress fully endorsed the Cripps proposals, viewing them as a satisfactory step towards independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* offer immediate complete independence. It proposed dominion status after the war, with the possibility of later independence. Statement 2 is correct. The mission proposed a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution for India, which would include representation from both British India and the princely states.  However, the method of representation for the princely states was a point of contention. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Congress *rejected* the Cripps proposals due to several key objections, including the offer of dominion status rather than immediate independence, the right of provinces to secede, and the lack of immediate power transfer. The failure of the Cripps Mission is a significant event in India's struggle for independence, highlighting the growing gap between British intentions and Indian aspirations. The mission's failure ultimately contributed to the escalation of the demand for complete independence and the intensification of the freedom struggle.


**9. With reference to the differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi and Bose were fundamentally united in their vision of a socialist India, differing only in their preferred methods of achieving it.
2.  Bose advocated for a more militant approach to the freedom struggle, while Gandhi remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violent resistance.
3.  Gandhi strongly opposed Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II, while Bose viewed it as a pragmatic strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both Gandhi and Bose expressed support for socialist ideals, their conceptions of socialism differed significantly. Gandhi favored a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose supported industrialization and state-led economic planning.  Statement 2 is correct. Bose advocated for a more aggressive, militant approach to the freedom struggle, believing that non-violent methods alone were insufficient to achieve independence. Gandhi remained committed to non-violent resistance, believing it to be the most ethically sound and effective method for mass mobilization. Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi vehemently opposed Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers, viewing it as morally reprehensible and strategically unsound. Bose justified his actions as a pragmatic strategy to leverage the weaknesses of the British Empire during World War II. The contrasting approaches of Gandhi and Bose exemplify the diverse strategies and ideologies within the Indian independence movement. Their differences highlight the complex debates surrounding the most effective path to freedom and the ethical considerations involved in the struggle against colonial rule.


**10. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement primarily involved urban elites and did not significantly involve the peasantry or other marginalized groups.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash occurred between protestors and police, led Gandhi to suspend the movement.
3.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, played a crucial role in mobilizing Muslim participation in the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the movement was initially led by urban elites, it did involve significant participation from peasants, students, and other marginalized groups, especially in rural areas.  Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence, prompted Gandhi to suspend the movement due to concerns about the increasing instances of violence that undermined the principle of non-violent resistance. Statement 3 is correct. The Khilafat issue, related to the post-World War I treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate, served as a powerful mobilizing factor, drawing in large numbers of Indian Muslims and contributing to Hindu-Muslim unity within the movement. The Non-Cooperation Movement is a crucial event in Indian history, demonstrating the capacity for mass mobilization and the complexities of managing a large-scale movement based on non-violent principles. The movement's successes and failures highlight the challenges of maintaining unity and discipline within a diverse movement, and the impact of unforeseen events on the course of the struggle for independence.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  However, efforts have been made to ensure these questions are challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905):**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on achieving complete independence from British rule through immediate and radical action.
2.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils, largely failed to satisfy nationalist demands for substantial Indian representation and power.
3.  The early nationalist movement exclusively relied on the Indian National Congress as its platform for expressing grievances and advocating for reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase (1885-1905) of the Indian National Congress is characterized by a moderate approach.  The focus was on gradual constitutional reforms within the existing British framework, not immediate complete independence.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others advocated for increased Indian participation in legislative councils and administrative reforms, hoping to achieve self-government through evolutionary means.  Radical calls for immediate independence emerged later.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the Legislative Councils, increasing the number of members and allowing for some indirect elections of Indian representatives. However, the act fell far short of nationalist aspirations.  The British maintained a significant official majority, limiting the actual power and influence of Indian members. The councils' powers remained restricted, failing to address the core concerns of the nationalists regarding control over the budget and meaningful participation in governance.  This led to widespread dissatisfaction among nationalists who viewed the act as a mere token gesture.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Indian National Congress played a central role, it wasn't the *exclusive* platform for nationalist expression during this period. Provincial conferences, local associations, and nationalist newspapers also played significant roles in articulating nationalist sentiment and mobilizing public opinion. These diverse platforms contributed to the growth of the nationalist movement, creating a wider network of influence and action beyond the Congress.


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory primarily focused on the negative impact of British policies on Indian agriculture, neglecting the industrial sector.
2.  The Swadeshi movement, primarily associated with the anti-partition agitation of Bengal, involved the boycott of British goods and the promotion of Indian industries.
3.  The early nationalists consistently demanded complete independence (Swaraj) from British rule, rejecting any form of cooperation with the colonial government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain of wealth" theory encompassed both the agricultural and industrial sectors. He argued that British policies systematically extracted India's wealth, hindering its economic development in various sectors. His analysis highlighted the exploitation of India's resources and labor, leading to impoverishment and underdevelopment across the economy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a significant part of the anti-partition agitation in Bengal, promoted the use of Indian-made goods (Swadeshi) and boycotted British products. This movement aimed to strengthen Indian industries and reduce economic dependence on Britain, demonstrating a clear link between economic and political freedom.  It was a crucial element in mobilizing mass support against British policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the demand for self-government (Swaraj) grew stronger over time, the early nationalists' approach was more moderate.  They initially sought gradual reforms within the existing system, hoping to achieve a larger share in governance and improve the lives of Indians.  While advocating for greater autonomy, they did not initially reject all forms of cooperation with the British government.  The complete independence demand became more prominent later in the nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in India (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolutionary terrorist movement primarily focused on assassinating high-ranking British officials, neglecting broader mass mobilization strategies.
2.  The partition of Bengal directly led to the rise of revolutionary terrorism, with no other contributing factors.
3.  Aurobindo Ghose advocated for passive resistance as the sole method for achieving Indian independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the revolutionary terrorist movement did involve assassinations of British officials as a tactic, it’s important to note that it wasn't their *sole* focus.  However, their efforts in mass mobilization were limited and less effective compared to their acts of violence. The movement lacked a coherent and widespread organizational structure to effectively mobilize the masses.  Their activities were largely confined to smaller groups and networks, focusing primarily on targeted acts of violence against specific British officials or symbols of authority.  The lack of a broader mass base contributed to the movement's limited long-term impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the partition of Bengal certainly acted as a catalyst and fueled the rise of militant nationalism, it wasn't the sole cause of revolutionary terrorism.  Other factors like increasing government repression, frustration with the slow pace of constitutional reforms, and the influence of revolutionary ideologies from other parts of the world also played crucial roles in shaping the movement. The partition served as a powerful trigger, but not the only reason.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Aurobindo Ghose, while initially advocating for passive resistance, later shifted towards a more radical and even revolutionary approach.  His views evolved, embracing a broader range of methods to oppose British rule.  He believed in utilizing all means necessary to achieve India's liberation, recognizing that passive resistance alone might not suffice.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922):**

1.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, played a crucial role in unifying Hindus and Muslims within the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Non-Cooperation Movement exclusively focused on non-violent methods, with no instances of violence reported during its course.
3.  The movement's success in achieving Swaraj was hampered by the British government's immediate and decisive response, leading to its early termination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat issue, stemming from the post-World War I treatment of Turkey by the British, became a powerful unifying factor between Hindus and Muslims.  The shared concern over the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate and the perceived injustice against Muslims created a common cause, leading to unprecedented Hindu-Muslim unity in opposing British rule. This collaboration was a significant aspect of the Non-Cooperation Movement’s success in its initial stages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the movement emphasized non-violent methods, the Chauri Chaura incident demonstrated that violence did occur.  The incident, where a mob set fire to a police station, killing policemen, significantly influenced Gandhi’s decision to suspend the movement. This highlighted the challenges of maintaining complete non-violence during a mass movement of this scale.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The British government did respond with repressive measures, arresting key leaders and suppressing the movement. However, to say the movement's failure was *solely* due to the British response is an oversimplification. Internal factors such as the Chauri Chaura incident, the movement's inherent limitations, and the waning of the Khilafat issue also contributed to its eventual decline.  The British response was a major factor, but not the only one.


**5. With reference to the Second Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), consider these statements:**

1. The Dandi March symbolized the Indian people's defiance of British salt laws, but had minimal impact on the overall movement’s scope.
2.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from various sections of Indian society, including women and peasants, but excluded industrial workers.
3.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the complete fulfillment of all major Congress demands, leading to the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dandi March was a highly symbolic act of defiance that captured the imagination of the Indian people and galvanized the Second Civil Disobedience Movement.  It was a powerful act that significantly broadened the movement's scope. It captured global attention and demonstrated the determination of the Indian people to resist British rule. The symbolic nature of the Salt Satyagraha resonated deeply with the Indian masses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Second Civil Disobedience Movement involved broad-based participation from various sections of society, including women, peasants, and *also* industrial workers.  The movement's impact extended to different parts of the country and included diverse social groups.  The participation of women was particularly noteworthy, challenging traditional gender roles and demonstrating their commitment to the freedom struggle.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, while a significant event, did not lead to the complete fulfillment of all major Congress demands.  The British government made some concessions, but many critical demands remained unaddressed.  The pact led to a temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement, but the underlying tensions and disagreements persisted, leading to the resumption of the movement later.  The pact was a temporary truce, not a complete resolution of the conflict.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Swarajists, No-Changers, and other political movements of the 1920s in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Swarajist and No-Changer factions within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajists, led by prominent figures like Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das, advocated for participating in legislative councils to expose the weaknesses of the colonial system.
2.  The No-Changers, including C. Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Patel, emphasized constructive work and the continuation of boycott and non-cooperation as the primary methods of resistance.
3.  The disagreement between the Swarajists and No-Changers led to a major split in the Congress similar to the 1907 Surat split, permanently dividing the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the core differences between the Swarajist and No-Changer factions. The Swarajists believed that working within the legislative councils could be a strategic tool to challenge colonial rule, while the No-Changers prioritized non-cooperation and constructive programs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While there was significant tension and disagreement, the Swarajist-No-Changer conflict did not result in a permanent split like the 1907 Surat split.  Both factions remained within the Congress, albeit with differing approaches, and eventually found common ground.  The absence of a complete schism allowed for a degree of unity when the time was right for renewed mass movements. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances of the nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the Swarajist Party's activities in the legislative councils, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajists consistently obstructed government legislation, leading to frequent deadlocks and effectively crippling the colonial administration's ability to govern.
2.  Vithalbhai Patel's election as Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1925 significantly strengthened the Swarajist Party's position and influence within the colonial legislature.
3.  The Swarajists successfully implemented a comprehensive policy that coordinated their legislative actions with mass movements outside the councils, leading to widespread anti-colonial mobilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially true; the Swarajists did employ an obstructionist strategy within the councils. However, it's an overstatement to say they "crippled" the administration.  While they caused disruptions and highlighted the weaknesses of the system, the colonial government was still able to function. Statement 2 is correct; Vithalbhai Patel's election as Speaker was a significant achievement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swarajists lacked a well-defined strategy to coordinate their legislative activities with mass movements outside the councils, a significant drawback of their approach.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to distinguish between partially true and completely accurate statements.



**3. With reference to the rise of socialist and communist ideas in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in 1920 was directly influenced by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the activities of the Comintern.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose were prominent figures within the Congress who were influenced by socialist and communist thought, advocating for more radical solutions to India's problems.
3.  The Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case and the Meerut Conspiracy Case were major government crackdowns on communist activities, leading to the imprisonment of numerous communist and left-wing leaders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually correct. The CPI's formation was directly linked to the Russian Revolution and Comintern influence.  Nehru and Bose, while not strictly communists, were influenced by socialist ideas and advocated for more radical approaches within the Congress.  The Kanpur and Meerut Conspiracy Cases were significant government attempts to suppress communist activities in India.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the historical context of the rise of leftist ideologies within the Indian national movement.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary activities in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was primarily active in the Punjab, United Provinces, and Bihar.
2.  The Kakori train robbery, orchestrated by the HRA, was a major turning point, leading to widespread arrests and executions of key revolutionary figures.
3.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant event in Bengal, demonstrating the revolutionary movement's capacity for coordinated armed action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the revolutionary movement in the 1920s. The HRA/HSRA's geographical focus and the significance of the Kakori robbery are well-documented.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid is also a key event showcasing the revolutionary movement's armed activities in Bengal.  This question tests factual knowledge and understanding of the different strands of revolutionary nationalism in India.


**5.  With reference to the No-Changers' constructive program after the Non-Cooperation Movement's withdrawal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The No-Changers primarily focused on establishing national schools and colleges to provide an alternative to colonial education.
2.  The No-Changers' efforts to promote khadi and hand-spinning were highly successful in quickly replacing imported textiles and achieving economic self-sufficiency.
3.  The No-Changers' constructive work significantly contributed to the organizational strength of the nationalist movement, laying the groundwork for future mass movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the No-Changers did prioritize establishing national educational institutions. Statement 3 is also largely correct; their constructive work did strengthen the organizational base of the nationalist movement.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the No-Changers promoted khadi, it was not a quick or complete replacement for imported textiles due to the cost and scale of production.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to evaluate the success and limitations of the No-Changers' program.  It tests understanding of the complexities of the nationalist movement beyond simple narratives of success or failure.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the debates on the future strategy of the Indian nationalists after the Civil Disobedience Movement:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for a solely Gandhian approach to constructive work, rejecting any engagement with the existing legislative structures.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru vehemently opposed the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy, advocating instead for a continuous, non-constitutionalist mass struggle.
3.  Gandhi initially opposed council entry but eventually conceded, allowing Congressmen unable to participate in Satyagraha to engage in parliamentary work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi did advocate for constructive work, Ansari, Ali, and Desai argued for a *constitutional* struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature, not solely a Gandhian approach.  Their argument was strategic—to maintain political interest and morale during a period of political apathy, gain prestige for the Congress, and build a platform for future action.

Statement 2 is correct. Nehru strongly criticized the "struggle-truce-struggle" (S-T-S) strategy proposed by Gandhi and his followers, viewing it as a cyclical and ultimately ineffective approach.  He believed in a continuous confrontation with imperialism until its complete overthrow, advocating a "struggle-victory" (S-V) strategy.  His vision emphasized the need for sustained mass action and the incorporation of class struggle into the anti-imperialist struggle.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi initially held reservations about entering the legislative councils, fearing it might lead to a compromise with imperialism. However, he later recognized the strategic value of council entry for those Congressmen who couldn't participate in Satyagraha, emphasizing that this engagement should not equate to faith in constitutional politics.  This pragmatic approach helped reconcile differing factions within the Congress.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act successfully established the proposed All-India Federation, encompassing British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and princely states.
2. Provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, granted provinces separate legal identities and significant financial powers.
3. The Act significantly expanded the franchise, enfranchising over 50% of the British Indian population and granting women equal voting rights with men.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The All-India Federation proposed under the Act never materialized due to the failure to meet the conditions of sufficient princely state participation. The central government continued to function under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1919.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system. This granted provinces greater self-governance, including separate legal identities and increased financial independence, allowing them to borrow money on their own security.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act did expand the franchise and grant women the right to vote on the same basis as men, it only enfranchised approximately 14% of the British Indian population, not over 50%. This limited enfranchisement highlights the continued limitations on democratic participation under British rule.


**3. With reference to the Swarajist Party and the "No-Changers," consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajists, led by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for a complete boycott of legislative councils, focusing solely on constructive work.
2.  The "No-Changers," opposed to council entry, emphasized constructive work, the continuation of boycott and non-cooperation, and quiet preparation for future civil disobedience.
3. The compromise reached in 1924 allowed Swarajists to contest elections as a group within the Congress, accepting the Congress program except for their council participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Swarajists advocated for *entry* into legislative councils, not a boycott. Their strategy was to use the councils as a platform to expose the weaknesses of the system and to obstruct government policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The "No-Changers" were indeed opposed to council entry, preferring to focus on constructive work and non-cooperation while preparing for future mass movements.  Their strategy prioritized grassroots mobilization and building organizational strength.

Statement 3 is correct.  A compromise was reached in 1924 that allowed the Swarajists to function as a group within the Congress, participating in elections while adhering to the broader Congress program. This demonstrates the internal dynamics and attempts at reconciliation within the nationalist movement.


**4. Consider the following statements about the events surrounding the launching of the Civil Disobedience Movement:**

1.  Gandhi's eleven demands presented to the Viceroy included a 50% reduction in land revenue, but not a reduction in military expenditure.
2. The Dandi March primarily focused on violating the salt tax, symbolically linking the struggle for Swaraj with the economic grievances of the poor.
3.  The immediate response to Gandhi's arrest in May 1930 was largely peaceful and limited to protests in major urban centers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi's eleven demands *did* include a 50% reduction in both military expenditure and land revenue, reflecting a broad-based approach targeting both general and specific grievances.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dandi March, culminating in the symbolic violation of the salt law, effectively linked the broader struggle for Swaraj with the concrete economic hardship faced by millions due to the salt tax.  The choice of salt was strategic—it was a universally used commodity, impacting even the poorest sections of society.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While some protests were initially peaceful, Gandhi's arrest sparked widespread and often violent protests across the country, notably in Sholapur, where a virtual parallel government was established for a time.  The response was far from limited to urban centers.


**5. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference saw significant participation from the Indian National Congress, which played a crucial role in shaping the outcome.
2.  The Second Round Table Conference, attended by Gandhi, resulted in a comprehensive agreement on the future constitutional framework for India.
3.  The Third Round Table Conference, boycotted by the Congress, led to the formulation of the Government of India Act, 1935.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress boycotted the First Round Table Conference, viewing the conference's objectives as inadequate.  The conference involved numerous other Indian groups and representatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Second Round Table Conference, while attended by Gandhi, did not result in a comprehensive agreement.  Key disagreements, particularly on minority representation (separate electorates), led to a deadlock and ultimately failed to produce a concrete constitutional framework.

Statement 3 is correct. The Third Round Table Conference was indeed boycotted by the Congress, and the subsequent deliberations led to the formulation and enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935.  This Act, however, was far from satisfactory to the Congress and other nationalist groups.


**6.  With reference to the differences between Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Gandhi and Bose wholeheartedly supported the concept of dominion status for India.
2. Bose favored a more militant approach to the freedom struggle, believing that violence was necessary to secure independence, while Gandhi remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violence.
3.  Both shared a deep dislike for communism and fascism but differed on the role of religion in public life and the ideal form of government for independent India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bose was a staunch advocate of *complete independence*, rejecting dominion status as inadequate. Gandhi, while initially willing to consider dominion status, ultimately shifted his focus to complete independence.

Statement 2 is correct. Bose strongly advocated for a more militant approach, even considering alliances with Axis powers to achieve independence, while Gandhi remained unequivocally committed to non-violence as the most effective and morally justifiable method.

Statement 3 is correct.  While both opposed communism and fascism, their views on religion and the ideal state differed significantly. Gandhi emphasized the centrality of religion in public life and envisioned a decentralized, almost stateless society, while Bose, though respecting traditional Indian spirituality, favored a more secular approach and considered an authoritarian state possibly necessary during the initial stages of nation-building.


**7. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution was passed at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Delhi in August 1942.
2. The spontaneous outbreak of protests following the arrests of Gandhi and other Congress leaders was largely non-violent and peaceful.
3. The movement's impact was limited to urban areas, with minimal participation from rural populations and workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Quit India Resolution was passed in August 1942, it was at the All India Congress Committee meeting in *Bombay*, not Delhi.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The movement, while initially inspired by Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence, quickly escalated into widespread violence and civil unrest in many parts of the country due to the lack of leadership and organization after the arrests of the Congress leaders.  The government's brutal repression further fueled the violence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement saw significant participation from rural populations and workers, who formed the backbone of the protests and uprisings in many areas. The movement's impact was widespread, extending far beyond urban centers.


**8. With reference to the impact of the Communal Award and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award granted separate electorates to the depressed classes, a provision strongly opposed by Gandhi.
2.  The Poona Pact, negotiated by Gandhi and Ambedkar, retained separate electorates for the depressed classes but increased their reserved seats.
3. The Poona Pact's impact on the depressed classes was overwhelmingly positive, resulting in their immediate social and economic upliftment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Communal Award did grant separate electorates to the depressed classes, a move that Gandhi vehemently opposed, fearing it would perpetuate social segregation and hinder the eradication of untouchability.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Poona Pact *abolished* separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with increased reserved seats in joint electorates. This compromise aimed to maintain the unity of the Hindu community while still providing some political representation for the depressed classes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Poona Pact provided increased political representation, its impact on the social and economic upliftment of the depressed classes was limited and complex.  It did not address the root causes of their marginalization, and in some ways, it reinforced existing power structures.  Ambedkar himself expressed reservations about the Pact in later years.


**9.  Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1. The movement saw widespread participation from all sections of society, including peasants, workers, students, and women, with near-universal Hindu-Muslim unity.
2.  The movement's primary focus was on achieving dominion status through constitutional means.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led Gandhi to suspend the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement did involve widespread participation from various sections of society, including peasants, workers, students, and women,  Hindu-Muslim unity, though significant, was not near-universal.  Incidents like the Moplah Rebellion highlighted the limitations of communal harmony within the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The movement's primary goal was not dominion status but the achievement of *Swaraj* (self-rule) through non-violent non-cooperation. Dominion status was a later political goal.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving the violent killing of policemen by protestors, deeply troubled Gandhi, leading him to believe that the movement had deviated from its non-violent principles and needed to be suspended to prevent further violence and its potential negative consequences.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru and seconded by Sardar Patel, called for the immediate end of British rule and the formation of a provisional government.
2.  Gandhi's instructions to government servants were to resign immediately and openly declare allegiance to the Congress.
3. The arrest of top Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, immediately preceded the launch of widespread, organized violence across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Resolution, indeed drafted by Nehru and seconded by Patel, demanded an immediate end to British rule and envisioned a provisional Indian government post-British withdrawal.  This was a crucial shift towards a more assertive demand for complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi's instructions to government servants were nuanced. He advised them *not* to resign en masse but to subtly shift their allegiance towards the Congress.  This was a strategic move to gradually weaken the colonial administration from within, without causing immediate disruption.  Open resignations would have been easily countered by the British.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the arrest of Congress leaders did lead to widespread protests, it's inaccurate to say these protests immediately manifested as widespread, *organized* violence. The initial response was spontaneous and largely leaderless, evolving into diverse forms of resistance, including both non-violent and violent actions.  The movement lacked centralized, coordinated direction after the arrests. The scale and intensity of violence varied regionally.


**2. With reference to the Rajagopalachari Formula, consider the following statements:**

1. The formula proposed a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas to decide the question of partition after the war.
2. Jinnah's rejection of the formula stemmed primarily from the Congress's refusal to accept the two-nation theory.
3. The formula explicitly stipulated a common centre for defence, commerce, and communications, even in the event of partition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajagopalachari Formula (CR Formula) proposed a post-war plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas of North-West and North-East India to determine whether they wished to form a separate state. This was a significant attempt to address the Muslim League's concerns.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While Jinnah's primary objection was the Congress's unwillingness to fully accept the two-nation theory, his rejection also stemmed from other aspects of the CR Formula such as the inclusion of non-Muslims in the plebiscite and the proposal of a common centre,  The two-nation theory was the core issue but other points contributed to his rejection.

Statement 3 is correct. A crucial component of the CR Formula was the agreement to have a common centre for defence, commerce, and communications even if partition occurred. This was intended to maintain some semblance of unity and cooperation between the proposed states post-partition.


**3. With reference to the Wavell Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan proposed an all-Indian executive council, excluding only the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief.
2. The Congress rejected the plan primarily because it sought to reduce the Congress to a purely caste Hindu party.
3.  The Muslim League's opposition stemmed from its fear that the plan would give other minorities equal representation and reduce the League's influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Wavell Plan aimed to reconstruct the Governor-General's executive council with all members being Indian, except for the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief. This was intended as a step towards greater Indian participation in governance.

Statement 2 is partially correct but oversimplifies the Congress's position.  While the Congress did object to the plan's implication that it represented only caste Hindus, their primary concern was the plan's overall inadequacy in addressing the issue of power transfer and the lack of a clear path towards independence. The caste Hindu aspect was one of several objections.

Statement 3 is correct. The Muslim League's main objection was its fear that the proposed equal representation for caste Hindus and Muslims would dilute the League's position, as other minorities might align with the Congress. This highlights the League's focus on securing Muslim dominance and its apprehension of being marginalized.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Mohan Singh initiated the formation of the INA using Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese.
2.  Rash Behari Bose played a crucial role in establishing the Indian Independence League in Tokyo, which later provided organizational support to the INA.
3.  The INA's advance into Indian territory culminated in the hoisting of the INA flag at Moirang, Manipur, in 1944, marking a symbolic victory for the movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mohan Singh, an Indian army officer, took the initiative to form the INA, primarily recruiting Indian prisoners of war held by the Japanese in Southeast Asia.  This was a significant development in the Indian independence struggle, utilizing a military approach.

Statement 2 is correct. Rash Behari Bose, a prominent revolutionary, played a pivotal role in establishing the Indian Independence League in Tokyo, providing crucial organizational and logistical support to the INA. His efforts in Japan helped garner Japanese support for the INA.

Statement 3 is correct.  The INA, under Subhas Chandra Bose, did make advances into Indian territory, culminating in the symbolic hoisting of the INA flag at Moirang, Manipur, in 1944. This event, though ultimately short-lived, held immense significance as a demonstration of the INA's reach and the aspirations of the movement.


**5. With reference to the post-war national scenario in India (1945-47), consider the following statements:**

1. The Labour government's ascent to power in Britain in 1945 marked a significant shift towards greater sympathy for Indian demands for independence.
2. The INA trials sparked widespread protests across India, significantly eroding the morale of the British armed forces and civil administration.
3. The RIN mutiny in Bombay in 1946, while initially displaying Hindu-Muslim unity, ultimately highlighted the growing communal divide in the country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Labour Party's victory in the 1945 British elections brought a government more amenable to Indian independence.  The Conservatives' earlier policies were far less sympathetic to the nationalist cause.

Statement 2 is correct. The trials of INA personnel ignited massive protests across India, severely impacting the morale of the British forces and the civil administration.  The widespread support for the INA demonstrated the shifting power dynamics and the waning support for British rule.

Statement 3 is correct. While the initial phases of the RIN mutiny showed some degree of Hindu-Muslim unity, the events also highlighted the growing communal tensions and the separate appeals made to different religious communities.  The mutiny's outcome reflects the complex interplay of nationalist and communal sentiments.


**6. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan rejected the demand for a fully independent Pakistan due to concerns about the significant non-Muslim population in the proposed territories.
2.  The plan proposed a three-tier structure of governance with executive and legislative bodies at the provincial, sectional, and union levels.
3. The Congress initially accepted the plan but later withdrew its acceptance after Nehru's statement suggesting that the grouping of provinces was optional.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cabinet Mission Plan rejected the creation of a separate Pakistan as envisioned by the Muslim League, primarily due to the substantial non-Muslim populations in the proposed territories.  This was a significant point of contention.

Statement 2 is correct. The plan proposed a three-tiered structure of government, comprising provincial, sectional (grouping of provinces), and union levels, each with its own executive and legislative bodies. This was intended to balance the demands of unity and autonomy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Congress initially accepted the long-term proposals of the Cabinet Mission. However, Nehru's subsequent statement implying that the grouping of provinces was optional led to the Muslim League withdrawing its acceptance, ultimately contributing to the breakdown of the plan.  This highlights the differing interpretations of the plan's key provisions.


**7.  With reference to the Quit India Movement's features, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement witnessed the establishment of parallel governments in several regions, briefly challenging British authority.
2.  The movement's participation was largely confined to urban centers, with limited involvement from rural areas.
3. The movement saw significant participation from various social groups, including students, workers, and peasants, but lacked substantial Muslim League support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Quit India Movement did see the emergence of parallel governments in several regions of India, illustrating the extent of the challenge to British authority. These were temporary administrations established by the movement's participants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initial phase of the movement saw significant urban participation,  the Quit India Movement spread widely into rural areas, demonstrating a broad base of support across India.  The rural participation was a key aspect distinguishing it from earlier movements.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Quit India movement witnessed participation from diverse social groups, including students, workers, and peasants. However, the Muslim League largely opposed the movement due to its concerns about the potential consequences for minorities in a post-British India.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the reasons for launching the Quit India Movement in 1942:**

1. The failure of the Cripps Mission heightened popular discontent and exposed Britain's unwillingness to grant meaningful self-governance.
2.  The imminent threat of Japanese invasion created widespread fear and uncertainty, fueling the desire for immediate independence.
3. The widespread economic hardships caused by World War II, such as rising prices and food shortages, contributed significantly to public unrest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The failure of the Cripps Mission to satisfy Indian demands for self-governance significantly contributed to the decision to launch the Quit India Movement. It highlighted the deep-seated mistrust between the British and Indian leadership.

Statement 2 is correct. The Japanese advance in Southeast Asia and the real possibility of their invasion of India created a climate of fear and urgency, significantly influencing the decision to launch the movement.  The fear of a Japanese occupation fueled the call for immediate independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The severe economic hardships caused by World War II, including rising prices, food shortages, and other difficulties, played a crucial role in increasing public discontent and making the populace more receptive to the call for independence. The economic conditions exacerbated existing political tensions.


**9. With reference to the  Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, encompassing both British Indian provinces and princely states, although this aspect of the Act was never fully implemented.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy.
3. The Act completely eliminated the Governor's special powers in the provinces, granting full autonomy to provincial legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, envisioned an All-India Federation comprising British Indian provinces and princely states. However, due to the unwillingness of many princely states to join, this aspect of the Act remained unrealized.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced a significant shift towards provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchical system which had divided powers between elected ministers and the governor.  This was a step towards greater self-governance at the provincial level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act did grant significant autonomy to the provinces, it did *not* eliminate the Governor's special powers completely.  The Governor retained considerable authority, particularly concerning matters related to law and order, minorities, and British interests.  These 'safeguards' were a point of contention for Indian nationalists.


**10. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement (1934-37), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'No-Changers' advocated for a focus on constructive work and the continuation of the boycott of legislative councils.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru, along with other leftist elements within the Congress, strongly opposed council entry, emphasizing the need for continued mass struggle.
3. Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later shifted his position, agreeing to give a trial to the formation of Congress ministries in provinces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 'No-Changers' faction within the Congress advocated for a continued focus on constructive work, emphasizing the importance of grassroots development and the boycott of legislative councils as a means of maintaining pressure on the British government.

Statement 2 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru and other leftist members of the Congress vehemently opposed the entry into legislative councils, arguing that such a move would dilute the revolutionary spirit of the movement and hinder the pursuit of complete independence. They preferred direct mass action over constitutional means.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi, initially skeptical of council entry, eventually changed his stance, agreeing to allow Congress participation in provincial elections and the formation of ministries in provinces where the Congress held a majority. This marked a shift in the Congress's strategy, combining mass movements with participation in the existing political system.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the events leading up to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Calcutta Session of the Congress in December 1928 saw the Nehru Report's approval, but younger Congress members advocated for *Purna Swaraj*.
2.  Gandhi's 1929 activities included organizing constructive village work and addressing specific grievances, mirroring the Bardoli agitation's approach.
3. Lord Irwin's October 31, 1929, declaration explicitly stated a timeline for the attainment of Dominion Status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Calcutta Session indeed approved the Nehru Report, advocating for dominion status, but younger leaders, including Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, pushed for *Purna Swaraj* (complete independence).  This divergence of opinion set the stage for the subsequent events.

Statement 2 is also correct. Gandhi's extensive travels in 1929 were geared towards preparing the populace for direct political action. His efforts focused on organizing constructive work in villages and addressing specific grievances, reflecting strategies employed in the successful Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928.  This groundwork was crucial for mobilizing support for the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Lord Irwin's declaration did reiterate the eventual goal of Dominion Status, as implicit in the 1917 declaration, it notably lacked any specific timeframe for its achievement. This omission fueled the discontent among those who desired immediate independence and contributed to the decision to launch the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The absence of a concrete timeline was a key factor in the failure to reach a compromise.


**2. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1931, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pact resulted in the unconditional release of all political prisoners, irrespective of the nature of their offenses.
2. The Congress agreed to participate in the Second Round Table Conference as a key provision of the pact.
3.  The Government's refusal to conduct a public inquiry into police excesses during the Civil Disobedience Movement was a point of contention that remained unresolved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact led to the release of political prisoners *not* convicted of violence.  This crucial distinction highlights the limitations of the agreement and the continued government resolve to punish those deemed violent.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant outcome of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was the Congress' agreement to participate in the Second Round Table Conference.  This participation, albeit with conditions, represented a significant step in the negotiation process.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Government's refusal to conduct a public inquiry into police excesses during the Civil Disobedience Movement was a significant point of disagreement that remained unresolved in the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, demonstrating the limitations of the agreement and the continued tensions between the Congress and the British government. The exclusion of this critical demand reflects the power imbalance inherent in the negotiation.


**3. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Salt March was primarily a symbolic gesture with minimal impact on the British administration.
2.  The movement saw widespread participation from various sections of society, including women, students, and peasants.
3.  The government's response to the movement was characterized by minimal use of force and a willingness to engage in negotiations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Salt March, while symbolic, was far from having a minimal impact. It galvanized widespread participation, generated considerable international attention, and directly challenged British authority.  It significantly eroded British prestige and highlighted the injustices of the salt tax.

Statement 2 is correct. The Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed participation from a broad spectrum of Indian society.  Women played a crucial role, participating in large numbers.  Students and peasants also actively participated, defying British laws and facing severe repression. This broad-based support was a crucial factor in the movement's success in challenging the colonial regime.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The British response to the Civil Disobedience Movement was far from minimal.  The government employed widespread and brutal repression, including lathi charges, arrests, and imprisonment of thousands of participants. This violent response underscores the colonial government's unwillingness to compromise on its authority, despite the movement's widespread popularity and support.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was primarily orchestrated by the older, established Congress leadership.
2. The arrest of key Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, led to a spontaneous and largely leaderless upsurge of protests.
3.  The government's response involved the establishment of martial law across the country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Quit India Resolution was passed by the Congress, the mass arrests of top Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, left the movement largely leaderless. This resulted in a spontaneous and widespread outbreak of protests, often defying the Congress's official non-violent strategy.  The absence of leadership allowed for a more decentralized and sometimes more violent expression of discontent.

Statement 2 is correct. The arrest of Gandhi and other key Congress leaders immediately following the passage of the Quit India Resolution resulted in a spontaneous and largely leaderless upsurge of protests throughout India.  This highlights the depth of anti-British sentiment and the people's readiness to challenge colonial authority.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the government's response to the Quit India Movement was extremely brutal, involving widespread arrests, suppression of the press, and the use of force against protestors, it did *not* involve the imposition of martial law across the entire country.  The government instead relied on a combination of military and police action, targeted repression, and the use of ordinances to suppress the movement.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA) and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. The INA was solely formed and led by Subhas Chandra Bose from its inception.
2. The INA's activities included the hoisting of the Indian flag on Indian soil during the Second World War.
3. The INA's military campaign was a resounding success, contributing significantly to India's independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose played a pivotal role in leading the INA in its later stages, the INA's origins predate his involvement.  Mohan Singh, an Indian Army officer, initiated the formation of the INA from Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia. Bose's leadership significantly boosted the INA's profile and effectiveness, but he did not found the organization.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant achievement of the INA was the hoisting of the Indian flag on Indian soil in Manipur during the Second World War.  This symbolic act, though ultimately short-lived, significantly boosted Indian morale and demonstrated the possibility of challenging British rule militarily.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INA's symbolic and morale-boosting impact was significant, its military campaign ultimately failed to achieve its goal of liberating India.  The INA's activities were closely tied to the Japanese war effort, and with Japan's defeat in the Second World War, the INA's campaign ended in failure.  However, the INA trial and the subsequent public support for the INA soldiers played a significant role in shifting British public opinion towards granting India independence.


**6. With reference to the post-Quit India Movement period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajagopalachari Formula (CR Formula) explicitly rejected the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan.
2. The Desai-Liaqat Pact proposed equal representation for Congress and Muslim League nominees in an interim government.
3. The Wavell Plan successfully established an interim government with equal representation for Hindus and Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajagopalachari Formula (CR Formula) did *not* reject the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan. Instead, it proposed a plan that included a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas to decide on the creation of a separate state.  This tacit acceptance of the possibility of Pakistan was a significant step in the evolving political landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The Desai-Liaqat Pact, an attempt at compromise between the Congress and the Muslim League, proposed an interim government with equal representation for both parties' nominees in the central legislature. This agreement demonstrated a willingness to share power and find common ground during a period of intense political division.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Wavell Plan, aimed at forming an interim government, ultimately failed to achieve its goal due to disagreements between the Congress and the Muslim League regarding representation. The Muslim League's insistence on having all Muslim members be League nominees prevented a consensus from being reached. The plan's failure underscored the deepening divide between the two major political forces.


**7. With reference to the debates on the future strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru strongly advocated for a continuation of the Civil Disobedience Movement, rejecting both constructive work and council entry as viable alternatives.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance in the provincial elections but later relented, allowing Congressmen to participate in provincial legislatures.
3. The Government of India Act of 1935 was widely accepted by Indian nationalists as a significant step towards self-governance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nehru was critical of the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy and advocated for continuous direct action, he did not completely reject all forms of engagement outside mass movements. He recognized the potential of engaging in constitutional politics strategically.

Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi initially expressed reservations about office acceptance, but considering the political climate and the need for a pragmatic approach, he eventually allowed Congress to participate in provincial elections, and even form ministries in provinces where they won a majority, thus allowing for a strategic engagement with the political system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 was largely rejected by the Indian National Congress. Although it introduced provincial autonomy, it retained significant British control and failed to address the fundamental demand for independence.  The Act was criticized for its inherent limitations and its reinforcement of communal divisions.


**8. With reference to the Congress crisis on the method of struggle following the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President in 1938 was met with unanimous support from all factions within the Congress.
2.  The Tripuri Congress session witnessed a significant confrontation between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi over the future strategy of the nationalist movement.
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose's resignation from the Congress presidency led to the formation of the Forward Bloc.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose was elected President of the Congress in 1938, his election was not met with unanimous support.  Gandhi and several other prominent Congress leaders opposed his candidature, highlighting the deep ideological differences within the Congress.  Bose's victory signified a significant shift in the Congress's internal dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tripuri Congress session marked a major confrontation between Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, showcasing the stark difference in their approaches to the struggle for independence.  Bose's preference for a more immediate and potentially more forceful approach clashed with Gandhi's emphasis on non-violence and a more measured strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. Following his resignation from the Congress presidency, Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Forward Bloc, a new political party.  This action marked a formal split within the Congress and reflected Bose's determination to pursue his own vision for India's independence.


**9. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose were staunch advocates of non-violence as the primary method for achieving independence.
2.  Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during the Second World War was driven by a deep ideological alignment with their philosophies.
3. Both Gandhi and Bose believed in a socialist future for India, although they differed on the methods of achieving it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi was a staunch advocate of non-violence, Bose believed that violent resistance might be necessary to achieve independence. This fundamental difference in their approach to the struggle for freedom led to significant ideological clashes and ultimately a split within the Congress.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers was primarily a strategic move aimed at exploiting the opportunity presented by Britain's wartime difficulties. It was not driven by a deep ideological agreement with the Axis powers' philosophies.  Bose remained critical of the Axis powers' ideologies, but he believed that any opportunity to challenge British rule should be utilized.

Statement 3 is correct. Both Gandhi and Bose envisioned a socialist future for India.  However, they differed significantly on the means of achieving this goal. Gandhi advocated for a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose favored rapid industrialization and a more centralized approach, reflecting their differing views on the role of the state and the pace of social and economic change.


**10. With reference to the events leading to Indian independence, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission's proposals were wholeheartedly accepted by both the Congress and the Muslim League, paving the way for a smooth transfer of power.
2. The Attlee statement of February 20, 1947, fixed a deadline for the transfer of power, irrespective of an agreement between Indian political parties.
3.  The Mountbatten Plan formalized the partition of India into two independent dominions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission's proposals failed to garner widespread support, ultimately failing to resolve the constitutional deadlock. Both the Congress and the Muslim League expressed significant reservations about various aspects of the proposals, highlighting the deep-seated differences between them and the limitations of the British offer.

Statement 2 is correct. The Attlee statement of February 20, 1947, set a deadline for the transfer of power, even in the absence of a consensus among Indian political parties. This decision reflected the British government's determination to withdraw from India, irrespective of the ongoing political tensions.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mountbatten Plan, announced on June 3, 1947, formally proposed the partition of India into two independent dominions: India and Pakistan. This plan, while controversial, became the basis for the eventual division of the subcontinent.  The plan addressed the demand for Pakistan while attempting to minimize the extent of the partition.


**1. With reference to the socio-political conditions in Indian princely states during the British Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chamber of Princes was established in 1921 primarily to foster greater autonomy for princely states.
2.  The All-India States' Peoples' Conference, founded in 1927, aimed to coordinate political activities within princely states advocating for democratic reforms.
3.  The Government of India Act of 1935 granted princely states a majority of seats in the proposed federal legislature's upper house.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chamber of Princes, established in 1921, was not designed to promote princely state autonomy. Instead, it served as a forum for the British to engage with and indirectly control the rulers of princely states.  The British used the Chamber to maintain their influence and to counter the growing Indian nationalist movement.  The Chamber did not offer significant autonomy; rather, it reinforced British paramountcy.

Statement 2 is correct. The All-India States' Peoples' Conference, established in December 1927, played a crucial role in coordinating political activities across various princely states.  Its primary aim was to advocate for democratic rights and popular governance within these states, challenging the autocratic rule of the princes and pushing for greater self-determination. This organization played a significant role in awakening national consciousness within the princely states.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Government of India Act of 1935 aimed to incorporate princely states into a federal structure.  However, the Act gave princely states disproportionate representation in the federal legislature. The proposed structure allocated princely states 2/5th of the seats in the upper house (Council of States) and 1/3rd of the seats in the lower house (Federal Assembly). This was a deliberate attempt by the British to curb the influence of the nationalist movement within the federal structure.  The overrepresentation of princely states in the upper house was a strategic move by the British to dilute the power of elected representatives from British India.


**2. With reference to the growth of communalism in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress's electoral performance in seats reserved for Muslim minorities was exceptionally strong in the 1937 provincial elections.
2. The Muslim League, under Jinnah's leadership, increasingly propagated the "two-nation theory," arguing for the partition of India.
3. Hindu communal organizations like the Hindu Mahasabha echoed the Muslim League's separatist sentiments, furthering the division.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Congress's electoral performance in seats reserved for Muslim minorities was far from strong.  In the 1937 elections, the Congress won a meager 26 out of 482 seats reserved for Muslims. This poor showing, in contrast to their success in other constituencies, highlighted the growing influence of the Muslim League and the deepening communal divide.  This result underscored the Muslim League's successful appeals to Muslim voters based on religious identity and fears of Hindu dominance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah's leadership, played a pivotal role in escalating communal tensions.  The League increasingly promoted the "two-nation theory," asserting that Hindus and Muslims were distinct nations and therefore could not coexist peacefully within a unified India. This ideology became the cornerstone of the League's demand for the creation of Pakistan.  The propagation of this theory was a major factor leading to the partition of India.

Statement 3 is correct. The growth of communalism was not a one-sided phenomenon. Hindu communal organizations, notably the Hindu Mahasabha, mirrored the Muslim League's separatist tendencies.  They emphasized Hindu identity and often echoed the "two-nation theory" by claiming India as the land of Hindus. This reciprocal reinforcement of communal identities exacerbated the existing tensions and deepened the chasm between the two communities. The actions of both Hindu and Muslim communal organizations contributed significantly to the deterioration of communal harmony and ultimately facilitated the partition of India.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress's response to the Second World War, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress initially supported the Allied war effort against Fascism but demanded India's independence or substantial self-government as a precondition for active participation.
2. The Cripps Mission, sent to India in 1942, offered Dominion Status immediately upon the conclusion of the war, leading to the Congress's full support of the war effort.
3.  Following the British Government's refusal to meet its demands, the Congress ordered its provincial ministries to resign in 1939.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Congress was sympathetic to the victims of Fascist aggression and willing to support the Allied cause against Fascism. However, the Congress leaders argued that an enslaved nation could not credibly aid others in their fight for freedom. They therefore insisted on India's independence or at least effective self-government as a prerequisite for participation in the war effort.  This position reflected the Congress's commitment to national self-determination and its rejection of subservient participation in a war without commensurate political gains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission, sent to India in March 1942, did *not* offer immediate Dominion Status.  The proposal outlined a plan for eventual Dominion Status after the war, but this was contingent on the formation of a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution for a post-war India.  The Cripps Mission's offer was ultimately rejected by the Congress due to its perceived ambiguity and lack of immediate self-governance.  The failure of the Cripps Mission further exacerbated tensions between the Congress and the British government.

Statement 3 is correct.  In 1939, when Britain declared India a party to the Second World War without consulting the Indian leadership, the Congress, in protest, ordered its ministries in the provinces to resign. This action demonstrated the Congress's firm stance against the British government's unilateral decision and its commitment to upholding India's political autonomy.  The resignation of the Congress ministries marked a significant escalation in the political conflict between the Congress and the British Raj.


**4. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, including petitions and public meetings.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's contribution to the early nationalist movement primarily involved leading mass protests and organizing boycotts of British goods.
3. The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1897 significantly broadened his influence beyond Maharashtra, galvanizing nationwide support for the nationalist cause.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905) was dominated by leaders often described as "Moderates."  These leaders primarily focused on constitutional methods of political agitation. Their approach involved submitting petitions to the government, organizing public meetings and speeches, and working through established legal channels to advocate for reforms.  This approach, while less confrontational, aimed to influence British policy through reasoned argument and public pressure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's contribution to the early nationalist movement was multifaceted, but it did not primarily involve leading mass protests and boycotts.  While he was a strong advocate for Swadeshi, his most significant contributions lay in his economic analysis of British rule in India, exposing its exploitative nature through works like "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India." He also played a crucial role in advocating for India's cause in the British Parliament and among the British public.  His focus was more on intellectual and political advocacy rather than direct mass mobilization.

Statement 3 is correct. Bal Gangadhar Tilak's arrest in 1897 on charges of sedition had a profound impact on the nationalist movement.  While he was already a prominent figure in Maharashtra, his imprisonment transformed him into an all-India leader.  The widespread protests and outrage that followed his arrest significantly broadened his influence and galvanized nationalist sentiment across India.  His arrest became a rallying point for those who felt the British were suppressing freedom of speech and expression.  The event significantly elevated the nationalist movement to a new phase of activism.


**5. With reference to the impact of the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act immediately led to the establishment of a fully independent, self-governing India.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, but Governors retained significant powers, including the ability to veto legislative actions.
3. The federal component of the Act, involving the integration of princely states, was successfully implemented soon after its passage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did *not* lead to an independent India. It was a significant step towards self-governance, introducing provincial autonomy, but it did not grant India full independence.  The Act maintained British control over key areas such as defence and foreign affairs, and the Governor-General retained considerable power.  India's independence only came in 1947.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting provinces a greater degree of self-rule.  However, the Act included "safeguards" that ensured the Governor retained significant powers, which included the ability to veto legislative decisions.  This power allowed the Governor to intervene in provincial affairs and to override the decisions of the elected provincial government, thereby limiting the extent of provincial autonomy.  The retention of these powers by the Governor reflected the British government's reluctance to relinquish complete control over India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The federal component of the 1935 Act, which aimed to integrate the princely states into an All-India Federation, was never implemented. The conditions for the federation's establishment, including the agreement of a sufficient number of princely states, were not met.  The failure to implement the federal provisions highlighted the limitations of the Act and the complexities of integrating the diverse political entities within India under a single federal structure. The lack of success in this area underscored the enduring difficulties in reconciling the interests of the British government, the princely states, and the Indian nationalist movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that creating truly difficult questions while maintaining perfect accuracy and avoiding ambiguity within the constraints of the prompt is challenging.  Some questions may lean towards moderate difficulty due to the nature of the source material and the need for precise, verifiable statements.


**1. With reference to the Swarajist and No-Changer factions within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajists, led by figures like C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for participation in legislative councils to expose their weaknesses and utilize them as platforms for political struggle.
2. The No-Changers, including C. Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Patel, opposed council entry, emphasizing constructive work and a continued boycott of legislative bodies.
3.  The Gaya session of the Congress in December 1922 witnessed the unanimous approval of the Swarajist proposal to "end or mend" the councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the contrasting ideologies of the Swarajists and No-Changers. The Swarajists believed in using the legislative councils as a tool for political action, while the No-Changers prioritized constructive work and continued non-cooperation with the British government. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Gaya session actually saw the *defeat* of the Swarajist proposal, leading to the formation of the Swaraj Party as a separate entity within the Congress.  This highlights the internal divisions and differing approaches to the freedom struggle within the Congress during this period. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the political dynamics of the time.


**2. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Republican Association/Army (HRA) and Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori train robbery in 1925 was a significant action undertaken by the HRA, aimed at securing funds for revolutionary activities.
2.  The HSRA, formed after a meeting in the ruins of Ferozshah Kotla in 1928, adopted socialism as its official ideology and shifted its focus from individual heroic action to mass mobilization.
3.  Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt's bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929 was intended as a non-violent act of protest, aimed at attracting public attention to their cause.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The HSRA's shift towards socialism and mass mobilization is well-documented, and the Assembly bombing, though involving explosives, was explicitly designed as a symbolic protest to gain publicity and avoid serious harm. Statement 1 is partially true in that the Kakori robbery was an HRA action, but the primary goal was not solely fundraising; it was a more complex act of defiance against British authority. The question tests factual knowledge of revolutionary movements and their evolving strategies.


**3. With reference to the debates on future strategy within the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first stage of the post-CDM debate focused on immediate strategies during the phase of non-mass struggle, while the second stage, in 1937, centered on office acceptance in the context of provincial elections under the Government of India Act, 1935.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru advocated for a continuous confrontation with imperialism until its overthrow, rejecting the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy favored by many Congressmen.
3.  The All India Congress Committee's (AICC) Patna session in May 1934 definitively rejected council entry, maintaining the stance of complete non-cooperation with the British government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the two-stage debate and Nehru's opposition to the S-T-S strategy.  Statement 3 is inaccurate; the Patna session actually established a Parliamentary Board to contest elections, demonstrating a shift towards participation in constitutional politics, even if with reservations. The question tests the understanding of the evolving strategies of the Congress and internal debates within the movement.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation, which included all British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, with the federation’s formation contingent upon specific conditions related to the princely states' participation.
2.  Provincial autonomy under the Act replaced dyarchy, granting provinces greater administrative and financial powers while retaining certain safeguards and special responsibilities for the Governor.
3. The Act introduced universal adult suffrage across all provinces, granting voting rights to all citizens irrespective of gender, caste, or religion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key provisions of the 1935 Act. The proposed federation never materialized due to the unfulfilled conditions concerning princely states, and provincial autonomy was indeed implemented, though with significant limitations on the powers of provincial governments. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act did expand the franchise, but it did *not* establish universal adult suffrage.  Communal electorates and other restrictions continued to exist, limiting the scope of democratic participation. The question tests factual knowledge of the 1935 Act and its complexities.



**5. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference, held in London from November 1930 to January 1931, saw the participation of the Indian National Congress, which played a pivotal role in shaping the subsequent constitutional reforms.
2. The Second Round Table Conference, held in 1931, was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress, leading to significant progress in negotiations with the British government.
3. The Third Round Table Conference, held in 1932, was boycotted by the Indian National Congress, leading to the formulation of the Communal Award by the British government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  The Indian National Congress boycotted the Third Round Table Conference, leading directly to the British government's unilateral announcement of the Communal Award.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Congress boycotted the First Round Table Conference.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while Gandhi attended the Second Round Table Conference, it did not lead to significant progress, and the conference ended in a stalemate. The question tests knowledge of the Round Table Conferences and their outcomes.


**6.  With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat Movement, focused on the plight of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I, provided a crucial platform for Hindu-Muslim unity in the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, encompassed boycotts of British institutions like schools, colleges, and courts, along with the promotion of swadeshi and khadi.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, involving violence against the police, led to the immediate suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi, despite opposition from some Congress leaders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements.  The Khilafat issue galvanized Muslim participation, the Non-Cooperation Movement involved widespread boycotts, and the Chauri Chaura incident did indeed lead to Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement, a decision met with criticism from some within the Congress.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of these significant movements in Indian history.



**7. With reference to the post-World War II period and the Indian nationalist response, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission, sent to India in 1942, offered dominion status as a long-term goal, with the formation of a constituent assembly to frame India's constitution after the war.
2. The Quit India Resolution, passed in August 1942, called for the immediate ending of British rule in India and proposed a non-violent mass struggle under Gandhi's leadership.
3. Following the suppression of the Quit India Movement, the Indian National Congress launched a large-scale campaign to support the trials of INA officers, viewing them as national heroes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Cripps Mission's offer, the Quit India Resolution's demands, and the subsequent campaign in support of INA officers are all well-established events in the history of the Indian independence movement.  The question tests factual knowledge of the events surrounding the end of British rule in India.


**8. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi was a staunch advocate of non-violent resistance (ahimsa) as the primary method for achieving independence, while Bose believed that violent resistance was necessary to overthrow British rule.
2.  Gandhi's economic vision emphasized village self-sufficiency and a decentralized economy, while Bose advocated for rapid industrialization and state-led economic planning.
3.  Both Gandhi and Bose shared a similar view on the role of religion in society, emphasizing religious tolerance and a secular state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly highlight the key ideological differences between Gandhi and Bose regarding the methods of struggle and economic policy.  Statement 3 is incorrect because while both were against religious intolerance, they differed significantly on the role of religion in the state – Gandhi viewed religion as a personal and social force that could influence governance, while Bose favoured a strictly secular state. The question tests an understanding of the contrasting ideologies of two pivotal figures in the Indian independence movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of Indian history and governance post-independence.


**1. With reference to the challenges faced by Independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The immediate challenges included the administrative integration of princely states and the rehabilitation of refugees from Pakistan.
2. Medium-term challenges involved the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of a democratic political order.  
3. Long-term challenges primarily focused on poverty alleviation and industrial development, neglecting crucial issues of social justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was a major immediate concern, requiring significant diplomatic and administrative effort.  The influx of millions of refugees from Pakistan created a humanitarian crisis demanding immediate attention, including resettlement, relief, and rehabilitation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The framing of the Constitution was a paramount medium-term goal, defining the nation's political framework and establishing democratic institutions.  Holding elections and building a representative government were crucial tasks during this period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While poverty alleviation and economic development were significant long-term challenges, the passage explicitly mentions that long-term challenges also included national integration.  Furthermore, the emphasis on social justice, particularly addressing caste inequalities, was a central concern throughout this period, and not something neglected. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of the long-term challenges.


**2. With reference to the first government of Independent India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru held the portfolios of Prime Minister, External Affairs, and Defence.
2. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel served as the Deputy Prime Minister and held the crucial Home Affairs portfolio.
3.  B.R. Ambedkar, initially the Law Minister, remained in the cabinet until the adoption of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister and held the portfolios of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, and Scientific Research, he did *not* initially hold the Defence portfolio. That was initially held by Sardar Baldev Singh.

Statement 2 is correct. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel served as the Deputy Prime Minister and was responsible for the critical Home Affairs portfolio, along with States and Information and Broadcasting.  His role in integrating the princely states was pivotal.

Statement 3 is incorrect. B.R. Ambedkar, although the first Law Minister, resigned from the cabinet in 1951, well before the adoption of the Constitution in 1950.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Radcliffe Boundary Award and its consequences:**

1. The Boundary Commission, headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had ample time and resources to delineate the boundaries between India and Pakistan.
2. The award, announced after Independence, led to widespread communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal.
3. The presence of Gandhi in Bengal mitigated the communal violence compared to Punjab.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Boundary Commission operated under severe time constraints, having only six weeks to complete its task.  This haste, coupled with inadequate resources and knowledge of the region, contributed to the flawed and contentious nature of the boundary demarcation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Radcliffe Line, announced after Independence, triggered widespread communal riots and violence, particularly in Punjab, where the partition directly bisected communities and territories.  Bengal also experienced significant violence, though arguably less severe than in Punjab.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the regions of Bengal, due to Gandhi's presence and efforts, experienced less violence compared to Punjab.  His interventions, including fasts, played a role in mitigating the conflict.


**4. With reference to the division of resources after the partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The division of defence personnel and equipment was smoothly executed due to the effective functioning of the joint defence council.
2.  The division of cash balances and allocation of public debt led to tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding the sterling balances.
3. Gandhi's fast regarding the sterling balances was unsuccessful in pressuring the Congress leadership to release Pakistan's share.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The division of defence personnel and equipment was far from smooth.  The text highlights serious differences between India and Pakistan, leading to the abolition of the Supreme Commander's post amidst significant chaos.

Statement 2 is correct. The division of financial resources, including cash balances and the allocation of public debt, created considerable tension.  The issue of sterling balances, representing the British debt to India, became a major point of contention.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Gandhi's fast was successful in pressuring the Congress leadership to release more cash resources to Pakistan. This action, according to some scholars, contributed to his assassination.


**5. With reference to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Nathuram Godse was tried and acquitted due to lack of sufficient evidence linking him directly to the assassination.
2.  The assassination led to the immediate and permanent ban of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
3. Nehru's response to Gandhi's death emphasized the importance of dedicating oneself to truth and the causes Gandhi championed.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nathuram Godse was tried and *sentenced to death*, not acquitted.  His trial and subsequent execution are well-documented historical events.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RSS was banned following Gandhi's assassination, the ban was later lifted in 1949 after the RSS accepted certain conditions.  The ban was therefore not permanent.

Statement 3 is correct. Nehru's address to the nation on All India Radio following Gandhi's assassination emphasized the profound loss and called upon the people to dedicate themselves to the principles of truth and non-violence for which Gandhi lived and died.


**6. With reference to the rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees after partition, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian government established a Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation to manage the refugee crisis, but its efforts were largely ineffective.
2.  Refugees from West Pakistan were primarily settled in Punjab and neighboring states, while those from East Pakistan were mainly settled in West Bengal.
3.  The Delhi Pact on Minorities effectively resolved the refugee problem and restored communal peace between India and Pakistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation was established, the passage does not suggest that its efforts were ineffective.  The passage describes significant efforts to resettle refugees, though acknowledging inequalities in the distribution of resources.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the settlement patterns of refugees after the partition, indicating that refugees from West Pakistan were largely resettled in Punjab and adjoining areas, while those from East Pakistan were accommodated in West Bengal and other northeastern states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Delhi Pact, while aiming to improve the situation of minorities and promote peace, did not effectively resolve the refugee problem. The passage highlights the continued challenges and the failure to encourage the return of refugees to their original homes.


**7. With reference to the Communist Party of India (CPI) and its response to Independence, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI initially denounced Indian independence as "fake" and viewed the Congress government as subservient to Anglo-American imperialism.
2. The CPI's initial strategy involved widespread armed insurgency across India, which quickly gained significant popular support.
3. The CPI later shifted its strategy from armed insurgency to participation in constitutional democracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI initially viewed Indian independence with skepticism, characterizing it as superficial and criticizing the Congress government for its perceived collaboration with imperialist forces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPI did advocate for armed insurgency,  their efforts were localized and did not gain widespread popular support. The movement remained largely confined to specific regions like Hyderabad and West Bengal.

Statement 3 is correct. The CPI eventually shifted its strategy, abandoning the armed insurgency approach in favor of participation in the electoral process and working within the framework of constitutional democracy.  This shift was influenced by internal divisions and the lack of mass support for armed rebellion.


**8.  With reference to the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The pact was signed in 1950 between Jawaharlal Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan to address the refugee crisis and communal tensions, primarily in Bengal.
2. The pact included provisions for the creation of minority commissions and the inclusion of minority representatives in government cabinets.
3. The pact successfully encouraged the return of refugees to their original homes and led to the complete resolution of communal issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru-Liaquat Pact was signed in 1950 between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to address the significant refugee problem and restore communal harmony, particularly in the Bengal region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The pact included provisions for the establishment of minority commissions to investigate the causes of communal violence and recommend solutions.  It also stipulated the inclusion of minority community representatives in government cabinets at both the central and provincial levels.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The pact's attempt to encourage the return of refugees failed due to the lack of confidence among the displaced population and the unresolved issue of their properties. Communal issues persisted despite the pact's efforts.


**9. With reference to the challenges associated with the division of resources after partition, consider the following statements:**

1. A partition council, headed by the Governor-General, oversaw the amicable division of the civil government, resulting in minimal disruption.
2. The division of finances caused tensions, particularly concerning Pakistan's share of the cash balances and the sterling balances owed by Britain.
3. The smooth and efficient division of the armed forces and equipment contributed to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a partition council was established, the process of dividing the civil government was not entirely smooth. The passage mentions that approximately 160,000 employees opted for transfer between India and Pakistan, indicating a significant administrative challenge.

Statement 2 is correct. The division of financial assets, including cash balances and the allocation of the sterling balances, created substantial tension between India and Pakistan.  This is a key aspect of the post-partition challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The division of the armed forces and equipment was far from smooth, characterized by chaos and disagreements.  The text highlights the difficulties in allocating units based on religious affiliations and the eventual departure of British troops.


**10. With reference to the political and economic challenges faced by newly independent India, consider the following:**

1. The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was achieved swiftly and without significant resistance.
2.  The initial focus of the Indian government was primarily on economic development, with limited attention paid to social justice issues.
3. The rehabilitation of refugees was a major challenge, leading to the establishment of refugee camps and various resettlement programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was a complex and challenging process, requiring substantial diplomatic and administrative efforts.  It involved negotiations, persuasion, and, in some cases, military intervention (as seen in Hyderabad).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that the Indian government faced numerous challenges, including immediate ones such as refugee rehabilitation, and medium-term challenges such as constitutional framing. Social justice was a major concern, not a neglected aspect.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage details the significant challenge posed by the large-scale influx of refugees and describes the government's efforts to establish refugee camps and implement resettlement programs.  This was a major humanitarian and administrative task.


**1. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for socialism in India, although their interpretations differed, with Gandhi favoring a decentralized, village-based model and Bose supporting industrialization-led socialism.
2.  Bose admired the discipline and organization of Fascist and Nazi regimes, while Gandhi vehemently opposed their ideologies and considered them dangerous aggressors.
3.  While both leaders were deeply religious, Bose's approach was more secular, advocating for state neutrality towards religion, unlike Gandhi, whose religious beliefs profoundly influenced his political philosophy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the ideological nuances between Gandhi and Bose.  Both indeed envisioned a socialist India, but their approaches differed significantly. Gandhi's vision was rooted in village self-sufficiency and traditional Indian values, aligning with his philosophy of Sarvodaya.  Bose, conversely, believed in rapid industrialization as a prerequisite for socialist transformation, drawing inspiration from the Soviet model.  

Statement 2 highlights a crucial divergence: Bose, while not a fascist or Nazi ideologue, admired their organizational efficiency and discipline.  This pragmatic approach contrasted sharply with Gandhi's unwavering condemnation of fascism and Nazism, stemming from his deep commitment to non-violence and his abhorrence of their totalitarian and expansionist policies.  The contextual understanding of Bose's strategy as a means to achieve independence, rather than an endorsement of the ideologies themselves, is crucial here.

Statement 3 correctly points out the religious dimensions of their ideologies. While both were religious figures, their approaches to religion and its role in governance differed. Gandhi's religious convictions formed the bedrock of his political philosophy, influencing his concept of Satyagraha and his vision of Ram Rajya.  Bose, while respecting religious beliefs, advocated for a secular state, emphasizing state neutrality regarding religion and individual freedom of faith. This divergence showcases their contrasting views on the relationship between religion and politics in the Indian context.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the Congress's response to World War II, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially offered conditional support to the British war effort, demanding immediate establishment of a responsible government at the Centre and the convening of a Constituent Assembly after the war to determine the political structure of a free India.
2.  Gandhi advocated for unconditional support to the Allied powers due to his strong opposition to Fascism and Nazism, while Subhas Bose and other socialists opposed supporting either side, viewing the war as an imperialist conflict.
3.  The Congress Working Committee's resolution at Wardha condemned Fascist aggression but insisted on India's right to self-determination as a precondition for participation in the war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the multifaceted response of the Congress to World War II.  The Congress's initial offer of conditional support, as stated in statement 1, reflects its strategic calculation to leverage the war situation for gaining concessions from the British. The demand for a responsible government and a Constituent Assembly highlights the Congress's ambition for self-rule and its rejection of mere collaboration in the war without substantial political gains.

Statement 2 correctly contrasts Gandhi's and Bose's positions. Gandhi's preference for supporting the Allied powers stemmed from his staunch opposition to Fascist and Nazi ideologies, aligning with his values of non-violence and democracy.  Conversely, Bose and other socialists viewed the war as fundamentally an imperialist conflict, rejecting support for either side and advocating for India's immediate independence. This divergence reveals the internal ideological divisions within the Congress.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the Congress Working Committee's resolution at Wardha, which condemned Fascist aggression while simultaneously asserting India's right to self-determination and its refusal to participate in the war without securing its freedom. This nuanced position demonstrates the Congress's commitment to both anti-fascism and national self-determination. Thus, all three statements are correct.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's main proposals included the establishment of an Indian Union with dominion status, the convening of a Constituent Assembly after the war to frame a new constitution, and the right of any province unwilling to join the Union to have a separate constitution.
2. The Congress's main objections to the Cripps proposals included the offer of dominion status instead of complete independence, the representation of princely states by nominees, and the absence of any plan for immediate transfer of power.
3. The Muslim League's criticisms of the Cripps proposals centered on the lack of explicit mention of Pakistan and the perceived denial of the Muslims' right to self-determination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the key aspects of the Cripps Mission and the responses it elicited from the major Indian political players. Statement 1 correctly outlines the core proposals of the mission: the offer of dominion status to an Indian Union, the post-war constitution-making process through a Constituent Assembly, and the option for provinces to secede and form separate unions. These proposals, while seemingly offering concessions, contained subtle provisions that ultimately contributed to their failure.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the Congress's reservations. The Congress's rejection of dominion status in favor of complete independence underscores its commitment to full sovereignty. The concerns regarding the nomination of princely state representatives and the lack of immediate power transfer reflect the Congress's distrust of the British government's intentions.

Statement 3 correctly points out the Muslim League's objections. The League's dissatisfaction with the absence of an explicit proposal for Pakistan and its concern over the denial of Muslim self-determination are key factors that led to the League's rejection of the Cripps proposals.  The failure of the Cripps Mission is directly linked to the inability to address the concerns of both the Congress and the Muslim League effectively.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, included the boycott of government institutions, foreign goods, and legislative councils, advocating for swaraj through peaceful means.
2. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1922, highlighting the challenges of maintaining non-violent discipline during mass mobilization.
3.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, provided a crucial platform for Hindu-Muslim unity and mass mobilization against British rule, though the movement's success was ultimately limited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements. Statement 1 correctly outlines the core tenets of the Non-Cooperation Movement: the boycott of British institutions and goods, the promotion of swadeshi, and the pursuit of swaraj through non-violent means.  The movement aimed at mass mobilization and challenging the legitimacy of British rule.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Chauri Chaura incident and its impact. The violence at Chauri Chaura, a tragic event stemming from the movement's mass mobilization, forced Gandhi to suspend the movement. This decision, while controversial at the time, underscores Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence and his recognition of the limitations of maintaining non-violent discipline during mass movements.

Statement 3 correctly identifies the role of the Khilafat issue. The Khilafat issue, by mobilizing widespread Muslim sentiment against British policies concerning Turkey, created a powerful common cause that facilitated Hindu-Muslim unity and significantly broadened the base of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The ultimate limitations of the movement, despite its initial success in fostering unity and challenging British rule, were partly due to the inherent complexities of managing mass mobilization and the eventual resolution of the Khilafat issue itself.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.


**5. With reference to the debates on future strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, a debate emerged within the Congress regarding the future strategy, with differing opinions on the role of constructive work, constitutional struggle, and mass movements.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru and other leftists within the Congress opposed the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy, advocating for a continuous confrontation with imperialism until its overthrow.
3.  Despite initial reservations, Gandhi ultimately agreed to a trial of forming Congress ministries in provinces after the 1937 elections, marking a shift in Congress strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Indian National Congress. Statement 1 accurately describes the context of the debate. The end of the Civil Disobedience Movement created a vacuum, prompting discussions on future strategies.  The debate involved differing viewpoints on constructive work (Gandhi's emphasis on social reform), participation in constitutional politics (council entry), and the continuation of mass movements.

Statement 2 accurately reflects Nehru's position and that of other leftists.  They criticized the cyclical "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy favored by many Congress leaders, including Gandhi, advocating instead for continuous direct action against imperialism until its complete eradication.  This reflects a more radical, less compromising approach to the struggle for independence.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the evolution of Gandhi's position. While initially opposed to office acceptance, Gandhi eventually conceded to a trial of forming Congress ministries in provinces after the 1937 elections.  This strategic decision, though fraught with potential risks, demonstrated a pragmatic approach to achieving political goals within the existing constitutional framework.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving the burning of a police station, led Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the movement.
2.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, significantly contributed to the movement's initial success by uniting Hindus and Muslims.
3.  The movement's objectives included the boycott of British goods, institutions (schools, colleges, courts), and government services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The Chauri Chaura incident, a tragic event of violence, profoundly impacted Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement due to his unwavering commitment to non-violence.  The Khilafat issue served as a powerful catalyst, bringing together Hindu and Muslim populations in a shared opposition to British rule. This unity was crucial for the movement's initial momentum and widespread participation. Finally, the movement's programme explicitly involved the boycott of British goods, educational institutions, and government services as forms of non-violent resistance.  Therefore, option (c) is the most appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial elements of the movement's context and objectives.  Understanding the interplay of these factors is vital for a comprehensive grasp of this significant historical event within the Indian freedom struggle.


**2. With reference to the differences between Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both leaders advocated for socialism in India, although their interpretations differed significantly.
2.  Bose believed in a more militant approach to achieving independence, contrasting with Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance (Satyagraha).
3.  While Gandhi prioritized the moral purity of means, Bose primarily focused on achieving the desired end, even if it required employing less-than-ideal methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the core ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose. Both leaders professed a belief in socialism for India, but their visions differed substantially. Gandhi's vision was rooted in decentralized village economies and self-sufficiency, while Bose envisioned a more centralized, industrialized socialist state.  Their approaches to achieving independence were diametrically opposed: Gandhi championed non-violent resistance (Satyagraha) as the primary method, while Bose believed that armed struggle was necessary to liberate India from British rule.  Finally, their contrasting philosophies on means and ends are clearly reflected in their actions and statements.  Gandhi emphasized the moral purity of the means as crucial to the ultimate goal, whereas Bose prioritized the achievement of independence, even if it meant allying with questionable powers like Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Option (c) is thus the correct answer, as it encompasses all these key distinctions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the full scope of the ideological divergence between these two prominent figures in India's freedom struggle.


**3. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was launched immediately following the failure of the Cripps Mission.
2.  The arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, triggered widespread spontaneous protests across India.
3.  The movement saw the establishment of several "parallel governments" in various regions, indicating a significant level of popular participation and control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Quit India Movement followed the Cripps Mission's failure, it wasn't launched immediately.  There was a period of planning and preparation.  Therefore, statement 1 is inaccurate. Statements 2 and 3, however, are entirely accurate. The mass arrests of Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, sparked immediate and widespread protests across India, demonstrating the depth of nationalist sentiment.  The creation of several parallel governments in regions like Ballia and Satara further underscores the extent of popular participation and the movement's ability to challenge British authority. These “parallel governments” undertook administrative functions, highlighting the movement's decentralized and grassroots nature. Thus, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete or contain factual inaccuracies regarding the timing and precise nature of the movement's initiation and popular response.  Understanding the context of the movement, including the role of spontaneous uprisings and the establishment of parallel administrations, is crucial for a complete understanding of this pivotal moment in Indian history.


**4.  With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established an All-India Federation that included both British Indian provinces and princely states.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy.
3.  The Act completely eliminated the system of communal electorates, paving the way for a unified electoral system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately represent key features of the Government of India Act, 1935.  The Act's central aim was to establish a federation encompassing both British Indian provinces and princely states, although this aspect remained largely unrealized due to the princely states' reluctance to join. The Act also replaced the earlier dyarchical system of governance in provinces with a system of provincial autonomy, granting provinces significantly greater self-governance. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Act did *not* eliminate communal electorates; instead, it retained and even expanded this system, allocating separate electorates for various religious and caste groups. This provision proved to be highly divisive and contributed to the communal tensions that would ultimately lead to the partition of India. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer, accurately reflecting the Act's introduction of federation and provincial autonomy while acknowledging the continued existence of communal electorates. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete or contain factual inaccuracies regarding the Act's provisions. A thorough understanding of the 1935 Act is essential for grasping the complexities of the Indian political landscape in the pre-independence era and its lasting impact.


**5. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference was boycotted by the Indian National Congress.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi represented the Indian National Congress as its sole representative at the Second Round Table Conference.
3.  The Third Round Table Conference saw significant progress towards a consensus on India's constitutional future.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of the Round Table Conferences.  The Indian National Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, boycotted the First Round Table Conference due to its dissatisfaction with the British government's approach.  The Second Round Table Conference, held after the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, saw Gandhi as the sole representative of the Congress, signifying a change in the British government's approach. However, statement 3 is inaccurate. The Third Round Table Conference, held without Congress participation, did not lead to any substantial progress on India's constitutional future, further highlighting the deep divisions and lack of consensus on the issue.  Therefore, option (a) is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete or contain inaccurate information about the participation of the Congress and the overall outcomes of these crucial conferences in the lead-up to Indian independence.  Understanding the dynamics and outcomes of these conferences is crucial for a nuanced understanding of the path to Indian independence.


**6. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's eleven demands presented to the British government included a reduction in military expenditure and the abolition of the salt tax.
2. The Dandi March symbolized the violation of the salt law, a pivotal moment in the movement.
3.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from diverse sections of society, including women, students, and peasants, but saw negligible involvement from the Muslim community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key events and demands of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Gandhi's eleven demands to the British government indeed included crucial economic demands like a reduction in military expenditure and the abolition of the salt tax, targeting both the economic burden on the masses and the symbolic nature of salt as a daily necessity. The Dandi March, where Gandhi famously broke the salt law, remains an iconic symbol of the movement's defiance of unjust laws. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the movement's leadership was primarily Hindu, the Muslim community's participation, although not as extensive as in the Non-Cooperation Movement, was still significant in various regions.  Several factors contributed to the varying levels of Muslim participation.  Option (a) is thus the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) fail to accurately represent the breadth of participation in the movement and the nature of Gandhi's demands.  Understanding the complexities of the movement, including its demands and the extent of social participation, is crucial for a complete understanding of this phase of the Indian freedom struggle.



**7. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INA was initially formed by Mohan Singh, an Indian army officer who defected from the British Indian Army.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose took over leadership of the INA after reaching Singapore in 1943.
3.  The INA's military campaign against British rule in India was ultimately successful in achieving independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  Mohan Singh, an Indian officer, initiated the formation of the INA from Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia. Subhas Chandra Bose later assumed leadership of the INA, significantly expanding its reach and influence. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The INA's military campaign, while symbolically important, was not successful in achieving Indian independence. The INA's activities contributed to the weakening of British authority and the growth of nationalist sentiment but did not directly lead to the end of British rule. The INA's ultimate defeat alongside the Japanese forces underscored that India's independence would not be achieved solely through military means.  Option (a) is therefore the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) either misrepresent the INA's origins, leadership, or ultimate outcome.  A proper understanding of the INA’s role in the larger context of the Indian independence movement requires acknowledging both its successes and its limitations.


**8. With reference to the early nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on achieving complete independence from British rule through immediate and direct action.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's writings highlighted the economic drain of wealth from India to Britain.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 significantly increased Indian representation and power within the legislative councils, satisfying the nationalists’ demands.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately reflects the early nationalist movement. Dadabhai Naoroji's work extensively documented the economic exploitation of India under British rule, highlighting the drain of wealth to Britain.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the early nationalists' approach was largely constitutional and gradualist, seeking greater Indian participation in governance rather than immediate independence through direct action.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding council membership, did not grant Indians substantial power, leaving the nationalists largely dissatisfied. The Act only made minor concessions and did not address the fundamental issues of colonial rule.  Therefore, only option (a) is correct. The other options contain factual inaccuracies regarding the strategies, demands, and outcomes of this early phase of the Indian nationalist movement.  A sound understanding of this period necessitates distinguishing the early, more moderate approaches from the later, more radical phases of the struggle for independence.


**9.  With reference to the  post-Non-Cooperation Movement period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajist party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for participation in legislative councils to obstruct government policies.
2.  The "no-changers" within the Congress, opposed council entry, emphasizing constructive programs like khadi production and Hindu-Muslim unity.
3.  The period witnessed a decline in communal tensions, with Hindu-Muslim unity remaining strong despite the end of the mass movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the political divisions within the Congress following the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The Swarajist party, formed by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, adopted a strategy of entering legislative councils to oppose the British government from within, using their presence to obstruct policies and raise public awareness.  The "no-changers," a faction opposed to this strategy, believed in focusing on non-political, constructive work to build national strength and promote Hindu-Muslim unity.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The period following the Non-Cooperation Movement saw a significant increase in communal tensions and violence, undermining the earlier efforts towards Hindu-Muslim unity. This resurgence of communalism was exploited by the British and affected the broader nationalist movement. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) inaccurately portray the post-movement political landscape and the state of communal relations.  Understanding this period requires recognizing the political divisions and the rise of communalism as significant factors shaping the course of the Indian independence movement.


**10. With reference to the debates on future strategy after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru advocated for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience, rejecting both constructive work and participation in elections.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance in provincial governments but later relented, allowing Congress participation in elections.
3.  The Congress decisively rejected the Government of India Act, 1935, and refused to participate in any way in its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates and the Congress's response to the Government of India Act, 1935.  Gandhi, initially opposed to office acceptance, eventually agreed to Congress participation in provincial elections and the formation of Congress ministries, recognizing the potential for constructive work within the existing system.  The Congress, while fundamentally rejecting the 1935 Act, ultimately decided to participate in the provincial elections, forming ministries in several provinces. This decision reflected a strategic shift, aiming to exert influence from within the system while continuing to oppose the Act's limitations.  However, statement 1 is inaccurate. Nehru, while critical of the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy, did not advocate for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience without any intermediary steps or alternative strategies. He favored a more continuous approach to confront imperialism but didn't entirely reject other forms of political action. Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the nuances of the debates and the Congress's final decision regarding participation in the political system established by the 1935 Act.  Understanding these complexities is essential to comprehend the strategic thinking of the Congress leadership during this crucial transition phase.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, particularly factual recall and analytical abilities.  Plausible distractors are included to increase difficulty.


**1. With reference to the Swarajist and No-Changer factions within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajists, led by figures like C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated for the boycott of legislative councils to pressure the British government.
2.  The No-Changers, including C. Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Patel, prioritized constructive work and opposed participation in legislative councils.
3.  The disagreement between the Swarajists and No-Changers led to a significant split within the Congress, mirroring the 1907 Surat split.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swarajists advocated for *entry* into legislative councils, not their boycott. Their strategy was to use these councils as platforms to expose British weaknesses and obstruct government policies from within.  Statement 2 is correct. The No-Changers believed that focusing on constructive programs like khadi production, education, and social reform would strengthen the nationalist movement and prepare for future mass struggles, while rejecting participation in what they saw as a compromised legislative system.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the disagreement was significant, it did not lead to a formal split like the 1907 Surat split.  Both factions remained within the Congress, albeit working separately, until a compromise was reached.  The absence of a full-fledged split highlights the importance of maintaining a united front against British rule, even amidst internal disagreements on strategy.  The differences were resolved through negotiation and compromise, reflecting a degree of political maturity within the Congress leadership.


**2. With reference to the emergence of new political forces in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of Marxist and socialist ideas in India was primarily influenced by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.
2.  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), founded in 1920, played a significant role in promoting Gandhian principles within the labor movement.
3.  Peasant agitations during this period were largely confined to the rural areas of Bengal and the United Provinces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Russian Revolution's success deeply influenced Indian political thought, leading to the formation of communist and socialist groups and a left-wing within the Congress.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the AITUC was indeed founded in 1920, it did not primarily promote Gandhian principles.  It was a key player in the burgeoning trade union movement, advocating for workers' rights and often employing more radical strategies than those favoured by Gandhi. Statement 3 is incorrect. Peasant agitations were widespread across various regions of India during the 1920s, including Gujarat (Bardoli Satyagraha), Andhra, Rajasthan, and Bombay Presidency, not limited solely to Bengal and the United Provinces.  The widespread nature of these agitations reflects the growing awareness of economic grievances amongst the peasantry and their increasing participation in the nationalist movement.  The diversity of locations also highlights the broader impact of the changing political landscape on rural India.


**3. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and its successor, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kakori train robbery was a key event in the early history of the HSRA, demonstrating its commitment to armed revolution.
2.  The assassination of John P. Saunders was a strategic decision by the HSRA to publicize its socialist ideology.
3.  Bhagat Singh's participation in the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly was intended as a symbolic act of protest, not an attempt to cause harm.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Kakori train robbery was carried out by the HRA, *before* it transformed into the HSRA.  Statement 2 is correct. The assassination of Saunders, though resulting in unintended consequences, was intended to draw attention to their cause and challenge British authority.  Statement 3 is also correct. The bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly was designed to be non-lethal; its purpose was to make a political statement and utilize the trial as a platform for propaganda. The strategic use of symbolic acts of defiance, rather than outright violence, highlights the evolving tactical approach of the HSRA in its attempt to garner public support and influence the political narrative. The actions were calculated risks aimed at achieving maximum propaganda impact.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary activities in Bengal during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant example of armed rebellion aimed at seizing weapons and resources.
2.  The participation of women revolutionaries in Bengal was largely limited to providing logistical support and shelter.
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose's involvement with revolutionary groups in Bengal ended with his entry into the mainstream Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid was a daring act of armed rebellion, aiming to disrupt British control and secure resources for the revolutionary movement.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Women played far more active roles than mere logistical support.  They participated directly in raids, carried arms, and engaged in combat. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Bose became a prominent figure in the Congress, his early association with revolutionary groups significantly shaped his political ideology and approach.  His actions continued to reflect a revolutionary zeal, even within the Congress, although his methods changed. The active participation of women in armed rebellion underscores the transformative nature of the revolutionary movement in Bengal, challenging traditional gender roles and expectations.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the debates on future strategies within the Indian National Congress after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement:**

1.  Gandhi initially favoured a return to constructive work as the primary focus of the nationalist movement.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru and other leftists within the Congress advocated for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience.
3.  The decision to participate in the 1934 elections to the Central Legislature was unanimously supported within the Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gandhi initially proposed a focus on constructive work, but later he agreed to contest elections. Statement 2 is also correct. Nehru and other leftists were critical of the suspension of mass action and wanted a more aggressive and continuous struggle against colonial rule.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  There was significant debate within the Congress regarding participation in the 1934 elections.  While the decision was eventually made to participate, it was not without opposition from those who felt it would compromise the nationalist movement's radical goals. The internal disagreements within the Congress highlight the complexities of navigating different strategic approaches within a large and diverse nationalist movement. The eventual compromise reflects the pragmatic approach of the Congress leadership in balancing various perspectives.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent Indian federation, granting complete autonomy to the provinces.
2. The Act introduced a bicameral legislature at the federal level, with the Council of States having a majority of elected members.
3.  The Act expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a larger segment of the Indian population, including women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act did *not* establish a fully independent federation; significant safeguards and reserved powers remained with the British Governor-General.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Council of States had a significant number of nominated members, not a majority of elected representatives. Statement 3 is correct. The Act did expand the franchise, significantly increasing the number of eligible voters and granting voting rights to women. The Act's provisions reflect a complex attempt by the British to balance the growing demands for self-governance with the need to maintain control over key aspects of Indian administration and defense. The limited nature of autonomy highlights the inherent contradictions within the British approach to Indian constitutional reform.


**7. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first Round Table Conference was boycotted by the Indian National Congress due to the exclusion of Indian representatives.
2.  The second Round Table Conference witnessed significant progress towards resolving the issue of minority representation.
3.  The third Round Table Conference was attended by Mahatma Gandhi, representing the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Congress boycotted the *first* Round Table Conference, but not because of the exclusion of Indian representatives; rather, it was due to the refusal to accept dominion status as the ultimate goal and the lack of a clear path towards complete independence. Statement 2 is incorrect. The second Round Table Conference failed to resolve the issue of minority representation; the deadlock over separate electorates and safeguards for minorities contributed significantly to its failure.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Gandhi attended the *second*, not the third, Round Table Conference.  The Congress boycotted the third conference due to the failure of the second conference to address key concerns. The failure of the Round Table Conferences highlights the deep-seated differences between the British government and the Indian National Congress regarding the future of India, particularly regarding the issue of complete independence versus dominion status.


**8. With reference to the Communal Award and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award was announced by the British government in response to the Congress's demand for separate electorates for minorities.
2.  The Poona Pact resulted in the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes.
3.  B.R. Ambedkar, initially a proponent of separate electorates, ultimately supported the Poona Pact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Communal Award was not a response to Congress's demands; instead, it was a unilateral decision by the British government to address the demands of various minority groups, leading to separate electorates for various religious and caste groups. Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Pact, negotiated by Gandhi, resulted in the abandonment of separate electorates for the depressed classes in exchange for increased reserved seats. Statement 3 is correct.  While Ambedkar initially advocated for separate electorates, he ultimately signed the Poona Pact, though with reservations and continued criticism of its provisions. The Poona Pact highlights the complexities of addressing caste-based inequalities within the broader context of the Indian nationalist movement.  It also demonstrates the significant influence of Gandhi in shaping the political discourse and achieving compromise amongst diverse groups.


**9. With reference to the "Quit India" Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Quit India" resolution was passed at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Bombay in August 1942.
2.  The movement was launched immediately after the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders.
3.  The movement was characterized by widespread non-violent resistance throughout India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Quit India resolution was indeed passed at the Bombay session of the AICC. Statement 2 is also correct. The arrests of Gandhi and other leaders triggered the spontaneous outbreak of the movement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the movement began with a commitment to non-violence, it witnessed instances of violence in response to severe government repression.  The spontaneous nature of the movement and the diverse range of responses highlight the complexities of managing a mass movement under conditions of extreme repression. The scale of participation reflects the depth of nationalist sentiment and the widespread desire for independence.


**10.  With reference to Subhas Chandra Bose's views and actions during the period leading up to and including World War II, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bose consistently advocated for complete independence (purna swaraj) as the ultimate goal of the Indian nationalist movement.
2.  Bose's election as Congress President in 1939 was met with unanimous support from within the Congress.
3.  Bose's formation of the Forward Bloc represented a complete break from the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bose consistently championed complete independence as the only acceptable goal for India.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Bose's election was met with significant opposition from Gandhi and other Congress leaders, leading to internal conflict within the organization. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Forward Bloc marked a significant divergence from the Congress's approach, it wasn't a complete break; Bose initially aimed to work within the Congress to influence its strategy.  The internal divisions within the Congress highlight the clash between different strategic visions for the Indian nationalist movement.  Bose's actions reflect his conviction in the need for a more assertive and potentially militant approach to achieving independence.


**11. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's philosophy of satyagraha emphasized non-violent resistance as the sole means to achieve independence.
2.  Bose believed that violent revolution was necessary to overthrow British rule in India and did not rule out collaboration with Axis powers.
3.  Both Gandhi and Bose were strong proponents of capitalism as the ideal economic system for post-independence India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Satyagraha formed the cornerstone of Gandhi's political philosophy. Statement 2 is correct.  Bose believed in a more radical and potentially violent approach to achieving independence. His collaboration with Axis powers, though controversial, highlights his pragmatic approach to achieving his goal. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Both Gandhi and Bose were critical of capitalism and advocated for alternative economic models, though their visions differed significantly.  Gandhi favoured a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose leaned towards socialist ideals and planned industrialization.  The contrasting approaches of Gandhi and Bose demonstrate the diversity of thought within the Indian nationalist movement.  Their disagreements highlight the complex choices and dilemmas faced by nationalist leaders in their struggle for independence.


**12. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission was sent to India primarily to secure Indian support for the British war effort against Nazi Germany.
2. The mission proposed the immediate establishment of a fully independent Indian government.
3. The mission's proposals were unanimously accepted by all major Indian political groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The deteriorating war situation in the East and the need for Indian support were the primary reasons for sending the Cripps Mission. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The mission proposed dominion status, not immediate full independence.  The offer of a constituent assembly to determine the future constitution was conditional and did not guarantee immediate independence. Statement 3 is incorrect. The mission's proposals failed to garner support from all major groups; the Congress, the Muslim League, and other groups raised significant objections, leading to its failure. The failure of the Cripps Mission underlines the deep divisions and mistrust that existed between the British government and the Indian nationalist leadership.  The mission highlights the limitations of negotiation and compromise in the face of deeply entrenched colonial power structures and the irreconcilable differences on the issue of independence.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement's initial leadership primarily comprised members of the middle class, who later expressed reservations about Gandhi's program.
2.  The movement saw widespread peasant participation, often exceeding the Congress's intended scope and leading to confrontations with landlords and traders.
3.  The movement witnessed significant participation from the Indian business class, uniformly supporting the economic boycott due to their alignment with Swadeshi ideals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Non-Cooperation Movement initially saw strong participation from the middle class, who provided much of the initial organizational and intellectual leadership. However, as the movement progressed, some segments of the middle class began to express reservations about Gandhi's methods and the program's overall direction.  This was particularly true in urban centers like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, where established elite politicians were less inclined to fully embrace Gandhi's radical call for non-cooperation.

Statement 2 is also correct. Peasant participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement was substantial and, in many instances, exceeded the planned scope of the Congress. This led to spontaneous uprisings and conflicts with both British authorities and local Indian elites, particularly landlords and moneylenders. The movement provided a platform for the expression of long-standing grievances against these power structures, often blurring the lines between anti-colonial and class-based struggles.  Examples include the Awadh Kisan Movement and the Eka Movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Indian business class did largely benefit from the emphasis on Swadeshi and initially supported the economic boycott,  the support wasn't uniform.  A segment of big businesses remained skeptical, fearing potential labor unrest and disruptions to their operations.  Their support for the movement was thus conditional and self-interested.


**2. With reference to the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, though seemingly focused on religious concerns, served as a powerful catalyst for Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule.
2.  The movement's success was primarily due to the unwavering support of the Congress, who fully endorsed the movement's goals and strategies from its inception.
3.  The Treaty of Sevres, signed in May 1920, significantly fueled the Khilafat agitation by formalizing the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and the removal of the Caliph from power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat Movement, although centered around the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate, played a crucial role in fostering Hindu-Muslim unity.  The shared opposition to British rule, coupled with the religious significance of the issue for Indian Muslims, created a powerful common cause. This unity was instrumental in the initial success of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi and a significant portion of the Congress supported the Khilafat Movement, the Congress wasn't entirely united on the issue.  There was initial resistance from leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who was wary of aligning with Muslim leaders on a religious issue and skeptical of Satyagraha as a political instrument. Gandhi's efforts to secure Congress's support were crucial to the movement's success.

Statement 3 is correct. The Treaty of Sevres, signed in May 1920, was a pivotal moment in escalating the Khilafat agitation.  The treaty's harsh terms for Turkey, including the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and the removal of the Sultan-Caliph from power, deeply angered Muslims worldwide, including those in India. This outrage fueled the movement's intensity and helped galvanize mass participation.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, consider the following statements:**

1. The movements significantly expanded the reach of nationalist sentiments, politicizing various segments of Indian society, including peasants, workers, and women.
2.  The movements resulted in the complete dismantling of British power in India, paving the way for immediate independence.
3.  Although the movements fostered a degree of Hindu-Muslim unity, they also contributed to the rise of communal politics, particularly by highlighting religious identities in the political sphere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements significantly broadened the base of the Indian nationalist movement.  The movements mobilized various social groups, including peasants, workers, and women, who had previously been less involved in organized political activity.  This mobilization marked a crucial step in expanding the reach and influence of nationalist ideas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, while impactful, did not lead to the immediate dismantling of British power in India.  The movements were ultimately suspended due to the Chauri Chaura incident and the inherent limitations of non-violent resistance against a powerful colonial state.  India's independence would only come years later after further struggles and negotiations.

Statement 3 is correct. While the movements initially fostered a degree of Hindu-Muslim unity, they also inadvertently contributed to the rise of communal politics. The emphasis on religious identity in the political mobilization, coupled with the inherent complexities of inter-communal relations, created a space for the growth of communal organizations and ideologies. This ultimately played a significant role in the partition of India.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the responses to the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The British government responded to the movement with immediate and widespread concessions, altering its policies to address the Congress's demands.
2.  The movement witnessed instances of violence, notably the Chauri Chaura incident, which significantly influenced Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement.
3.  The Muslim League unequivocally supported the movement, viewing it as an effective means to achieve its political objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British government's response to the Non-Cooperation Movement was primarily one of repression, not concession.  The government employed various measures to suppress the movement, including arrests of leaders, banning of organizations, and use of force against protestors.  The government's unwillingness to negotiate or compromise contributed to the movement's eventual suspension.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where protestors set fire to a police station resulting in the deaths of policemen, was a turning point in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This act of violence, although not representative of the movement's overall non-violent strategy, deeply concerned Gandhi, leading him to believe that the masses were not yet ready for large-scale civil disobedience and prompting him to suspend the movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Muslim League initially supported the Non-Cooperation Movement due to its alignment with the Khilafat issue, the support wasn't absolute or unwavering. The League's participation was driven by its own political goals, and differences in strategy and objectives between the Congress and the League remained.


**5. With reference to the individuals involved in the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah played a pivotal role in leading the Khilafat movement.
2.  The Ali brothers (Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali) were prominent leaders of the Khilafat movement and played a significant role in the Non-Cooperation Movement.
3.  Mahatma Gandhi served as President of the All India Khilafat Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a prominent figure in Muslim politics, he did not play a leading role in the Khilafat Movement. His political stance and strategies differed from those of the Khilafat leaders. He eventually withdrew from the Congress, believing in a constitutional and lawful struggle.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ali brothers, Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, were indeed prominent leaders of the Khilafat Movement and played a crucial role in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Their passionate advocacy for the Khilafat cause and their strong anti-British sentiments helped mobilize significant Muslim participation in both movements.

Statement 3 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi did serve as the President of the All India Khilafat Committee, demonstrating the Congress's support for the movement and highlighting the importance of Hindu-Muslim unity in the struggle against British rule.  His leadership in this context was instrumental in bridging the gap between the two communities and in shaping the broader political strategy of the Non-Cooperation Movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects, and adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission's failure to resolve the constitutional deadlock was a significant catalyst for the movement.
2.  The Japanese advance towards India's borders significantly contributed to the popular willingness to participate in the movement.
3.  The Congress Working Committee's resolution authorizing Gandhi to lead the movement was passed at the Bombay session in August 1942.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cripps Mission, despite its attempts, failed to offer a satisfactory solution to India's constitutional demands.  This fueled widespread disillusionment with British promises and contributed significantly to the escalating demand for immediate independence, ultimately leading to the Quit India Movement.  The failure exposed Britain's unwillingness to truly concede power, triggering a surge in nationalist sentiment.

Statement 2 is also correct. The imminent threat of a Japanese invasion, coupled with the perceived weakness of British forces in Southeast Asia, significantly bolstered the Quit India Movement. The fear of a "scorched earth" policy by the British and the instability of British rule (evident in bank runs) created a sense of urgency and heightened the public's willingness to actively participate in the struggle for independence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Quit India Resolution was indeed approved at a Congress meeting in Bombay, this meeting took place in August 1942, not at a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting. The CWC meeting where Gandhi was authorized to lead the movement was held in Wardha in July 1942.  The Bombay meeting ratified the resolution already passed by the CWC. This subtle difference is crucial for accurate factual recall.


**2. With reference to the responses to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress's objections included the offer of dominion status instead of complete independence and the right of provinces to secede.
2. The Muslim League primarily opposed the mission's proposals due to concerns about the lack of explicit provisions for a separate Muslim state (Pakistan).
3.  The Hindu Mahasabha's objections were primarily based on the mission's failure to address the concerns of the depressed classes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Congress vehemently rejected the Cripps Mission's proposal of dominion status, arguing for complete independence.  The right of provinces to secede, a key provision enabling partition, also drew strong opposition from the Congress, which prioritized national unity.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Muslim League's primary concern was the absence of a clear commitment to the creation of Pakistan.  The mission's vague proposals regarding provincial autonomy were insufficient to address the League's demand for a separate Muslim state, leading to their rejection of the proposals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the depressed classes did have concerns about the potential implications of the Cripps Mission, particularly regarding the right of provinces to secede, the Hindu Mahasabha's primary objections stemmed from the mission's failure to fully address the issue of Hindu interests and the potential for a weakening of Hindu influence in a united India.  The depressed classes' concerns were not the central focus of the Hindu Mahasabha's critique.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA) and its activities, consider the following statements:**

1. The INA's first division was formed in September 1942, coinciding with the beginning of the Quit India Movement.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose took command of the INA from Rash Behari Bose in July 1943.
3. The INA's advance into Indian territory culminated in the hoisting of the INA flag at Imphal in March 1944.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The formation of the INA's first division in September 1942 directly coincided with the outbreak of the Quit India Movement in India, providing a boost to the INA's recruitment efforts and a sense of parallel support for the struggle for independence.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Subhas Chandra Bose assumed leadership of the INA from Rash Behari Bose in July 1943, marking a significant turning point in the INA's development and bringing a charismatic leader to head the organization.  Rash Behari Bose's earlier work was crucial in establishing the INA's foundation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INA did advance into Indian territory, the first hoisting of the INA flag on Indian soil occurred at Moirang, Manipur, in April 1944, not Imphal, and under the command of Colonel Malik, not Subhas Chandra Bose directly. The claim about Imphal is a plausible distractor, playing on knowledge of the Imphal campaign.


**4. With reference to the Wavell Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan proposed the reconstruction of the Governor-General's Executive Council with equal representation for caste Hindus and Muslims.
2.  The Congress objected to the plan because it perceived it as an attempt to reduce the Congress to the status of a purely caste Hindu party.
3. The Muslim League's primary objection was the plan's failure to guarantee a separate Muslim state (Pakistan).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Wavell Plan aimed to create a more representative executive council, including Indian members, with a focus on parity between caste Hindus and Muslims.  This was a key element of the plan designed to address the prevailing communal tensions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Congress strongly opposed the Wavell Plan because it believed the plan was designed to portray the Congress as representing only the interests of caste Hindus, thereby undermining the Congress's claim to represent all Indians irrespective of caste. This was a major point of contention.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Muslim League did have reservations about the plan and ultimately rejected it, their primary objection was not the lack of a separate Muslim state.  Their main concern stemmed from the fear that the plan's structure would reduce the League's influence within the council, as other minority groups might align with the Congress. The omission of Pakistan was not the central point of their opposition at that stage.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajagopalachari Formula:**

1. The formula proposed a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas to decide on the formation of a separate state after the war.
2.  Gandhi supported the formula, while Jinnah rejected it due to his insistence that the Congress accept the two-nation theory.
3. The formula proposed a common center for defense, commerce, and communications, even in the event of partition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajagopalachari Formula (CR Formula) included a provision for a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas of Northwest and Northeast India to determine their future status as part of a united India or as a separate independent state after the war.  This was a significant attempt to address the Muslim League's demands.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Gandhi endorsed the CR Formula as a potential path towards a negotiated settlement, while Jinnah rejected it. Jinnah's rejection stemmed from his insistence that the Congress explicitly accept the two-nation theory, a precondition that the Congress was unwilling to meet at that time.

Statement 3 is also correct.  A crucial aspect of the CR Formula was the proposal for a joint agreement on a common center responsible for defense, commerce, and communications, even if partition occurred. This was an attempt to ensure some level of cooperation and stability in the event of India's division.  This detail highlights the complexity of the proposed solution.


These MCQs test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, requiring candidates to differentiate between correct and incorrect information presented in plausible but subtly misleading ways.  The explanations provide detailed justifications for the correct answers and expose the flaws in the incorrect options, mirroring the style of UPSC question analysis.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian political history and the evolution of the nationalist movement, demanding detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The first session of the Indian National Congress was significantly influenced by the pre-existing Indian National Conference, spearheaded by figures like Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose.
2.  The early Congress leadership predominantly comprised lawyers, journalists, and wealthy landowners, reflecting the limited social base of the movement during its initial years.
3.  The Congress's initial demands focused primarily on administrative reforms, including the expansion and increased powers of the legislative councils, rather than immediate self-rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the early Congress. Statement 1 is correct because the Indian National Conference, established prior to the Congress, provided a crucial model and a pool of experienced leaders for the nascent nationalist movement.  The presence of figures like Banerjea and Bose in both organizations highlights this connection. Statement 2 is also accurate; the early Congress membership largely consisted of the educated elite, reflecting the limitations of mass mobilization in the movement's formative years. This was due to various factors including limited literacy and communication infrastructure.  The composition of the Congress membership demonstrates the initial narrow social base of the movement. Statement 3 correctly points out that the early Congress adopted a gradualist approach, focusing on incremental reforms within the existing constitutional framework.  The emphasis on legislative council reforms reflects the moderates' belief in working within the system to achieve gradual progress toward self-governance.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete representations of the historical reality.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" argued that British rule systematically depleted India's wealth through unfair economic policies and trade practices, contributing significantly to India's poverty.
2.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the legislative councils, significantly increased Indian representation and granted substantial powers to elected representatives.
3.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader, advocated for immediate complete independence (Purna Swaraj) as the ultimate goal of the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Dadabhai Naoroji's influential "drain theory," which highlighted the economic exploitation inherent in British rule.  This theory became a cornerstone of early nationalist economic critique, demonstrating the detrimental impact of colonial policies on India's economic development.  Statement 2 is incorrect because, while the Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the councils, it did *not* significantly increase Indian representation or grant substantial powers.  The Act only allowed for a limited number of indirectly elected Indian members, with officials retaining a clear majority and significant control over the legislative process.  This limited nature of the reforms fuelled further nationalist demands. Statement 3 is incorrect because Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader, advocated for self-government within the British Empire, not immediate complete independence (Purna Swaraj).  The demand for Purna Swaraj emerged later in the nationalist movement, associated with more radical factions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the debates within the Indian National Congress following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and other Congress leaders advocated for a renewed focus on constructive work along Gandhian lines, emphasizing social reform and nation-building activities.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend, strongly criticized both Gandhian constructive work and participation in elections, advocating instead for the immediate resumption of mass civil disobedience.
3.  The All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting at Patna in 1934 established a Parliamentary Board to oversee Congress participation in elections to the Central Legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some Congress leaders did advocate for constructive work,  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and others actually advocated for *constitutional struggle* and participation in elections to the Central Legislature, not solely constructive work.  This represented a different strategic approach to engaging with the British government. Statement 2 correctly identifies Nehru's leftist position,  criticizing both Gandhian methods and electoral participation as insufficient for achieving independence.  He favoured a continuation of mass struggle. Statement 3 is accurate; the AICC meeting at Patna did establish a Parliamentary Board to manage Congress's electoral participation. This decision marked a significant shift towards engaging in constitutional politics.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and the princely states, which was fully implemented immediately.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, and granted provinces significant financial and legislative powers, independent of the central government.
3. The Act significantly expanded the franchise, enfranchising a substantial portion of the British Indian population, including women, and introducing direct elections for provincial legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act *did* propose an All-India Federation, it was never fully implemented due to the failure to secure the participation of a sufficient number of princely states.  The proposed federation remained a significant unrealized aspect of the Act. Statement 2 accurately describes the introduction of provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchy system and granting provinces more control over their administration and finances. This was a crucial change in the constitutional structure. Statement 3 is also correct. The Act did expand the franchise, albeit to a limited extent (approximately 14% of the population), but it did enfranchise women for the first time on the same basis as men and introduced direct elections for provincial legislatures.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**5.  With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was launched following the failure of the Cripps Mission to secure a satisfactory constitutional settlement with the Indian National Congress.
2.  The arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and other top Congress leaders immediately following the launch of the movement severely hampered the movement's effectiveness and organization.
3. Parallel governments were established in several regions of India during the Quit India Movement, demonstrating the movement's ability to organize and administer at the grassroots level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Movement was directly triggered by the failure of the Cripps Mission, which heightened the sense of frustration and urgency among nationalists. The inadequate proposals further fueled the demand for immediate independence. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the arrest of Gandhi and other leaders was a significant blow, it did *not* severely hamper the movement's effectiveness.  The arrest actually sparked widespread spontaneous protests and underground activities, demonstrating the depth of nationalist sentiment and the movement's ability to function without its established leadership. Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of parallel governments in several regions, such as in Ballia and Midnapore, highlights the movement's capacity for grassroot organization and administration, even in the face of severe repression.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct.  The arrest of the leadership, while impactful, did not cripple the movement as much as it might initially seem.


**6. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi firmly believed in the efficacy of non-violent resistance (Satyagraha) as the sole means to achieve independence, while Bose advocated for a more flexible approach, including the possibility of armed struggle.
2. Gandhi emphasized the importance of moral purity of means and ends in political action, whereas Bose prioritized achieving independence, even if it involved allying with powers he ideologically opposed (such as Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan).
3.  Both Gandhi and Bose supported socialism as the ideal economic system for post-independence India, but differed in their approaches and interpretations of socialism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the key ideological differences between Gandhi and Bose. Statement 1 correctly contrasts Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violent resistance with Bose's more pragmatic and flexible approach, which considered armed struggle as a viable option under certain circumstances.  Statement 2 accurately highlights their differing perspectives on the relationship between means and ends in political action. Gandhi insisted on moral purity, while Bose prioritized the achievement of independence, even if it meant strategic alliances with powers he did not fully endorse ideologically.  Statement 3 is also correct; both leaders expressed support for socialism, but their visions differed significantly.  Gandhi favored a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose supported industrialization and state-led planning, drawing inspiration from the Soviet model.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate contrasts of their ideologies.


**7. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA) and its role during World War II, consider the following statements:**

1. The INA was initially formed by Mohan Singh, an Indian army officer, from Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia, operating independently of the Indian National Congress.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose's leadership of the INA significantly boosted its morale and recruitment, transforming it into a powerful symbol of Indian resistance against British rule.
3. The INA's military campaigns in India during World War II were highly successful, leading to significant territorial gains and weakening British control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mohan Singh initially formed the INA from Indian prisoners of war in Southeast Asia, independently of the Congress. This initial phase of the INA was largely characterized by its ambiguous relationship with the Japanese and its uncertain political direction. Statement 2 is also correct. Bose's leadership provided the INA with a clear nationalist identity and significantly enhanced its appeal, boosting morale and recruitment. His charisma and commitment to independence inspired many Indians to join the cause. Statement 3 is incorrect. The INA's military campaigns in India were not successful.  Despite initial advances, the INA was ultimately defeated, and its military impact on British rule was limited. The INA's significance lies more in its symbolic value and its impact on Indian political consciousness than on its military achievements.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**8.  With reference to the  post-Quit India Movement period (1942-1947), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajagopalachari Formula, proposed in 1944, aimed to resolve the constitutional deadlock by offering a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas to decide on the creation of Pakistan.
2. The Wavell Plan, proposed in 1945, aimed to create an interim government in India with equal representation for Hindus and Muslims, but failed due to disagreements between the Congress and the Muslim League.
3. The Cripps Mission of 1942 successfully achieved a constitutional agreement that secured Indian support for the Allied war effort during World War II.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Rajagopalachari Formula, which attempted to address the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan through a plebiscite.  This formula represented a significant attempt at compromise, though it ultimately failed. Statement 2 correctly outlines the Wavell Plan's aim of creating an interim government with parity between Hindus and Muslims, but it accurately notes the plan's failure due to the lack of agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League.  This failure highlighted the deepening communal divide. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission failed to achieve a constitutional agreement; its proposals were rejected by both the Congress and the Muslim League, leading to increased political tensions.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  The Cripps Mission is a crucial example of a failed attempt at compromise.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian nationalism, political repression, and the evolution of nationalist strategies during the early 20th century.


**1. With reference to the early 1900s Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab.
2.  Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were among the Bengal leaders deported in December 1908.
3.  The arrest and imprisonment of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1908 resulted in a six-month prison sentence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The deportations of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were indeed a direct consequence of the unrest and riots in the Punjab's canal colonies.  This event highlighted the British government's swift and often harsh response to any perceived threat to their authority.

Statement 2 is also correct. The deportation of nine Bengal leaders, including the prominent figures Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, in December 1908, exemplifies the British government's strategy of suppressing dissent and silencing prominent voices within the nationalist movement.  This action was part of a broader crackdown on nationalist activities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that Bal Gangadhar Tilak received a six-year prison sentence, not a six-month sentence, following his arrest in 1908. This longer sentence reflects the severity of the British response to Tilak's nationalist activities and his influence on the movement.  The discrepancy in the prison sentence length serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's factual recall.


**2. With reference to the strategies of militant nationalists in early 20th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Militant nationalists advocated solely for armed rebellion as their primary method of achieving independence.
2.  Aurobindo Ghose's programme emphasized making British administration impossible through organized non-cooperation.
3.  The militant nationalists successfully mobilized the vast peasant population into their movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While militant nationalists did advocate for more assertive and sometimes aggressive methods, their approach wasn't limited exclusively to armed rebellion.  Their strategies encompassed a range of actions, including passive resistance, boycotts, and other forms of civil disobedience.  The statement oversimplifies their multifaceted approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aurobindo Ghose's strategy, as described in the text, focused on creating a situation where the British administration became unworkable through organized non-cooperation. This highlights the intellectual and strategic thinking behind the militant nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the militant nationalists aimed to broaden their base, they didn't successfully mobilize the vast peasant population to the same extent as later movements under Gandhi. Their influence primarily remained concentrated within urban and educated classes.  The failure to reach the peasantry underscores a crucial limitation of their strategy.



**3. With reference to the impact of the anti-partition agitation in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The anti-partition agitation marked a significant turning point in Indian nationalism, leading to increased boldness in political action.
2.  The agitation resulted in the immediate and complete success in reversing the partition of Bengal.
3.  The agitation saw widespread participation from all sections of Indian society, including peasants and industrial workers, demonstrating complete national unity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The anti-partition agitation, while ultimately unsuccessful in its immediate goal of preventing the partition, significantly impacted Indian nationalism. It fostered a bolder and more assertive political stance among Indians, demonstrating their willingness to challenge British authority through mass mobilization and various forms of protest. This marked a crucial shift in the nature of the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The partition of Bengal was not immediately reversed.  The partition was eventually annulled in 1911, but this occurred years after the initial agitation, highlighting the limited short-term success of the movement. The delay in annulling the partition serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of historical timelines.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the agitation did involve a broader range of participants than earlier movements, it did not achieve complete national unity.  Significant sections of society, particularly the Muslim peasantry, remained largely unengaged or even opposed to the movement due to several complex factors. The lack of complete national unity is a crucial point, highlighting the complexities of the movement.  The option's claim of complete unity is a significant overstatement.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the responses to the partition of Bengal:**

1.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on promoting indigenous industries through boycotts of British goods.
2.  Rabindranath Tagore's "Amar Sonar Bangla" was written in response to the partition and later became the national anthem of Bangladesh.
3.  The partition of Bengal was primarily driven by the British government's concern for efficient administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Swadeshi movement was a key response to the partition, focusing on economic self-reliance through promoting Indian industries and boycotting British goods. This demonstrates a shift towards a more assertive and self-reliant approach to challenging British rule.

Statement 2 is correct.  "Amar Sonar Bangla," composed by Rabindranath Tagore, was indeed inspired by the events surrounding the partition of Bengal and became a powerful symbol of Bengali nationalism. Its later adoption as the national anthem of Bangladesh further underscores its significance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the British government presented administrative efficiency as a justification for the partition, it was widely perceived as a tactic to weaken the nationalist movement in Bengal by dividing the Bengali population along religious and linguistic lines.  The statement underplays the political motivations behind the partition decision.  The supposed administrative rationale is a key distractor.


**5. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced a system of direct elections for all members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
2. Separate electorates were established for Muslims, granting them representation exceeding their population percentage.
3. The reforms significantly increased the power and authority of the Indian Legislative Councils, leading to near self-governance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did not introduce a system of direct elections for all members of the Imperial Legislative Council. The elections were indirect, involving multiple layers of electoral colleges. This indirectness limited the direct influence of the electorate on the composition of the councils.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, granting them representation beyond their proportional share in the population. This measure, while intended to appease Muslim leaders, had long-term consequences for communal harmony in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did not significantly increase the power and authority of the Indian Legislative Councils.  They expanded representation but did not grant self-governance. The councils remained largely advisory bodies with limited powers, and the British government retained ultimate control. The statement overstates the extent of power transfer.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1905-1918):**

1. The partition of Bengal, implemented by Lord Curzon in 1905, directly led to the rise of militant nationalism, characterized by calls for passive resistance and Swadeshi.
2. Aurobindo Ghose's advocacy for "making the administration impossible" through organized refusal to cooperate with British commerce and officialdom, marked a shift towards more assertive nationalist strategies.
3. The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the deportation of several Bengal leaders significantly weakened the militant nationalist movement, hindering its ability to harness the energies of the masses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the militant nationalist movement between 1905 and 1918.  The Partition of Bengal acted as a catalyst, igniting widespread protests and fostering a more radical nationalist sentiment.  The resulting Swadeshi and Boycott movements, coupled with calls for passive resistance, were crucial in this shift.  Aurobindo Ghose's strategy, emphasizing non-cooperation with British economic and administrative systems, exemplifies the growing militancy and the rejection of purely constitutional methods.  Finally, the repression faced by the movement, including the arrest of key figures like Tilak and the deportation of other leaders, significantly hampered its organizational strength and ability to effectively mobilize and sustain mass participation. The movement's inability to provide effective leadership and create a sound organization contributed to its eventual decline after the arrests and retirements of key leaders.  Therefore, all three statements accurately represent key events and characteristics of this period.


**2. With reference to the Indian nationalist movement in the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth of revolutionary terrorism was a direct consequence of the failure of the political struggle and government repression.
2.  Revolutionary groups like the Anushilan Samiti and Abhinava Bharat primarily focused on assassinating unpopular officials rather than instigating a mass revolution.
3.  While revolutionary terrorism failed to achieve its primary objective of expelling the British, it significantly contributed to the growth of nationalism by fostering a sense of pride and defiance among Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe facets of the revolutionary terrorism that emerged in India during the early 20th century.  The frustration stemming from the limitations of constitutional methods and the government's harsh response to nationalist activities fueled the rise of revolutionary groups who resorted to violence. These groups, such as the Anushilan Samiti and Abhinava Bharat, largely focused on targeted assassinations of British officials, reflecting a strategy of symbolic resistance rather than a broad-based popular uprising. While failing to achieve their primary goal of immediate British expulsion, their actions significantly impacted the nationalist movement. The heroism and self-sacrifice displayed by these revolutionaries instilled a sense of pride and defiance among Indians, contributing to the overall growth of nationalist sentiment and challenging the British narrative of complete control.  Thus, the actions, though limited in their immediate impact, contributed significantly to the larger nationalist struggle.


**3. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "struggle-truce-struggle" (S-T-S) strategy, advocated by Gandhi and many Congressmen, proposed alternating between phases of mass mobilization and periods of negotiation with the British government.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a leftist trend within the Congress, criticized the S-T-S strategy, advocating instead for a "continuous direct action" policy without any constitutionalist phase.
3.  The Congress's decision to participate in the 1937 provincial elections, despite its opposition to the Government of India Act, 1935, was a strategic move aimed at both deepening anti-imperialist sentiment and gaining political power at the provincial level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Indian National Congress. Gandhi's S-T-S strategy aimed to strategically manage the mass movement, alternating between periods of intense struggle and temporary truces for negotiation and regrouping.  This approach reflected a belief in the need for periodic mass mobilization punctuated by periods for assessing the situation and strategizing for future actions. Nehru's critique of this strategy stemmed from his belief in a more continuous and aggressive confrontation with imperialism.  He argued for sustained direct action without the interruptions of constitutionalist phases, reflecting a more radical and less compromising approach to the struggle for independence.  Finally, the Congress's decision to contest the 1937 elections, while rejecting the Government of India Act, 1935, was indeed a strategic maneuver.  The Congress sought to utilize the elections to further its anti-imperialist goals, galvanize popular support, and simultaneously gain control of provincial governments, even with limited powers, to promote its agenda and build strength for future mass movements. Therefore, all three statements are accurate in their depiction of the complex strategic debates within the Congress during this crucial phase.


**4. With reference to the emergence of new forces in the Indian nationalist movement during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The spread of Marxist and socialist ideas led to the formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in 1920 and the rise of a left wing within the Congress, represented by figures like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose.
2.  The growth of trade unionism, spearheaded by the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), witnessed significant strikes in major industrial centers, reflecting the increasing working-class participation in the nationalist struggle.
3. The rise of revolutionary groups like the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and its successor, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), represented a rejection of non-violent methods, advocating for armed revolution and socialist ideals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture the emergence of significant new forces within the Indian nationalist movement during the 1920s. The influence of Marxist and socialist ideologies was undeniable, resulting in the formation of the CPI and the rise of a left wing within the Congress, with Nehru and Bose advocating for socialist solutions.  The growth of trade unionism, reflected in the major strikes across India, showcased the increasing involvement of the working class in the nationalist cause and the AITUC’s role in organizing this force.  Finally, the emergence of revolutionary groups like the HRA/HSRA, with their emphasis on armed struggle and socialist goals, marked a distinct departure from the predominantly non-violent strategies of the Congress, providing an alternative path for those who believed in more radical action.  These three developments fundamentally reshaped the landscape of Indian nationalism, introducing diverse ideologies and approaches to the struggle for independence.



**5. With reference to the events surrounding the Quit India Movement of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's failure to secure a commitment from the British government for the immediate transfer of power to Indians fueled the Congress's decision to launch the Quit India movement.
2. The spontaneous nature of the Quit India movement, triggered by the arrest of Gandhi and other Congress leaders, resulted in widespread protests, strikes, and acts of defiance against British authority.
3.  While the Quit India movement was ultimately suppressed by the British government through brutal repression, it demonstrated the depth of nationalist sentiment and the Indian people’s capacity for widespread resistance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately describe the circumstances leading to and the consequences of the Quit India Movement. The failure of the Cripps Mission to deliver on the Congress's demand for immediate independence was a pivotal factor in the Congress's decision to launch the movement. The arrests of Gandhi and other leaders sparked a spontaneous and widespread upsurge of protests and acts of defiance, highlighting the deep-seated resentment against British rule.  Although the movement was violently suppressed by the British government, resulting in widespread arrests, killings, and widespread violence, it undeniably demonstrated the strength of nationalist sentiment and the Indian people's willingness to engage in mass resistance, even in the absence of organized leadership. Therefore, all three statements reflect key aspects of this historical event and its significance in the struggle for Indian independence.


**1. Consider the following statements about the deportations and imprisonments of Indian nationalists in the early 20th century:**

1.  Nine Bengal leaders, including Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt, were deported in December 1908, following the anti-partition movement.
2.  Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 after riots in the Punjab canal colonies.
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak received a six-year prison sentence in 1908.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect events in the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement.  The deportation of nine Bengal leaders in 1908 was a direct consequence of the escalating anti-partition movement and the government's crackdown on dissent.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 stemmed from unrest in the Punjab's canal colonies, highlighting the British government's response to nationalist agitation in different regions.  Finally, Bal Gangadhar Tilak's six-year imprisonment in 1908 underscores the harsh measures employed to suppress the growing nationalist movement, especially the extremist faction.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one factually correct statement about these significant events in Indian history.  These events demonstrate the British government's use of repression to quell the rising tide of Indian nationalism.  Understanding the context of these actions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the period.


**2. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurobindo Ghose advocated for making the British administration impossible through organized refusal to cooperate with British commerce and officialdom.
2.  The militant nationalists successfully harnessed the energies of the peasantry in their movement.
3.  The arrest of Tilak and the withdrawal of Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghose from active politics significantly weakened the militant nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Aurobindo Ghose's strategy of passive resistance and non-cooperation. He advocated for a complete boycott of British systems to cripple their administration.  Statement 3 is also correct; the arrest of Tilak and the withdrawal of Pal and Ghose significantly hampered the movement's leadership and organization, leading to its decline.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the militant nationalists aimed to reach the masses, their movement primarily remained confined to the urban lower and middle classes. They failed to effectively mobilize the peasantry, a crucial limitation of their strategy. This highlights the challenges faced by the early nationalist movements in India in reaching and engaging the rural population. The failure to effectively connect with the rural masses proved a significant weakness. The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the peasantry or exclude the accurate statements about Aurobindo Ghose's strategy and the impact of the key leaders' removal from active participation.


**3. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The assassination of two British officials in Poona in 1897 by the Chapekar brothers marked an early instance of revolutionary terrorism.
2.  V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a secret society that advocated for peaceful means of achieving independence.
3.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent terrorist organization, had widespread branches across India, including a large Dacca section.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Chapekar brothers' assassination as a precursor to the growth of revolutionary terrorism.  Statement 3 accurately describes the Anushilan Samiti's extensive network, particularly its significant presence in Dacca.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was indeed a secret society, but it was explicitly dedicated to revolutionary activities, advocating violent methods to overthrow British rule, not peaceful ones.  The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement about Abhinava Bharat's methods or omit the accurate details about the Chapekar brothers and the Anushilan Samiti's reach. The success of the Anushilan Samiti in establishing such a vast network highlights its organizational capabilities and the widespread appeal of revolutionary ideas among certain segments of the Indian population. The contrast between Abhinava Bharat's violent approach and the peaceful methods often associated with other nationalist groups further illustrates the diversity of strategies employed during the freedom struggle.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress (INC) during 1905-1918, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1905 INC session saw Gokhale, as President, condemning Lord Curzon's reactionary regime and the partition of Bengal.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, chosen as a compromise candidate for the INC presidency, declared Swaraj as the goal of the Indian national movement in his presidential address.
3.  The Surat split of 1907 saw the militant nationalists successfully retaining control of the INC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the stance of the 1905 INC session under Gokhale's presidency.  The session strongly condemned the partition of Bengal and criticized Curzon's policies. Statement 2 is also correct; Dadabhai Naoroji's presidential address at a subsequent session explicitly declared Swaraj (self-rule) as the ultimate goal of the Indian national movement.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Surat split of 1907 resulted in the moderate faction gaining control of the INC, effectively marginalizing the militant nationalists. The other options are incorrect as they either include the inaccurate statement about the Surat split or exclude the factually correct statements regarding Gokhale's condemnation and Naoroji's declaration of Swaraj.  The fact that Dadabhai Naoroji, a respected figure across the nationalist spectrum, was chosen as a compromise candidate, highlights the tensions and divisions within the INC at that time. The Surat split itself demonstrates the deep ideological and strategic differences that existed within the nationalist movement.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909:**

1.  The reforms significantly increased the number of directly elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils.
2.  Some elected seats were reserved for landlords and British capitalists in India.
3.  The reforms granted Indians substantial control over the budget of the Indian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly points out that the Morley-Minto Reforms included reserved seats for landlords and British capitalists, reflecting the British government's strategy of co-opting certain segments of Indian society.  However, statement 1 is incorrect.  While the reforms did increase the number of elected members, most were elected indirectly, not directly by the people. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the reforms did not grant Indians substantial control over the budget.  The councils could discuss the budget but lacked the power to vote on it or significantly influence its allocation.  The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly state that members were directly elected or attribute to the reforms powers they did not confer. The reservation of seats for specific groups demonstrates the limited nature of the reforms and the British government's reluctance to grant genuine self-governance. The lack of budgetary control highlights the continued dominance of British authority and the constraints placed on Indian participation in governance.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the period of militant nationalism in India (1905-1909) and related events, drawing upon themes of governance, political movements, and social dynamics.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab, significantly impacting the movement's trajectory.
2.  Aurobindo Ghose's advocacy for passive resistance aimed to render British administration unfeasible through organized non-cooperation with exploitative policies.
3.  The militant nationalists effectively mobilized the peasantry, forming a broad-based mass movement across rural India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The deportations of Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, following the Punjab canal colonies riots, were a major event in escalating the conflict between the nationalists and the British administration.  This action further radicalized the nationalist movement, pushing it towards more assertive and militant strategies.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurobindo Ghose's vision of passive resistance was a key element of the militant nationalist strategy.  His call for non-cooperation with the British economic and administrative system was intended to cripple the colonial government's ability to function effectively. This approach represented a shift from purely constitutional methods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the militant nationalists aimed to reach the masses, their movement primarily impacted urban lower and middle classes. They failed to effectively mobilize the peasantry, a significant limitation of their influence and reach.  The movement lacked the organizational structure and grassroots connections necessary for widespread rural mobilization. This restricted their ability to build a truly mass-based movement across the diverse Indian landscape. The absence of a strong peasant base proved to be a significant weakness in the long-term success of the movement.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Partition of Bengal (1905) on the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition, intended to weaken Bengali nationalism, instead fueled a widespread Swadeshi movement focused on boycotting British goods and promoting indigenous industries.
2. The Swadeshi movement, though initially successful in mobilizing mass support, ultimately failed to establish a cohesive and well-organized political party structure.
3.  The partition directly led to the immediate and complete independence of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Partition of Bengal, while intended to divide and weaken the nationalist movement concentrated in Bengal, had the opposite effect. The widespread resentment and anger it generated led to the eruption of the Swadeshi movement, which became a powerful symbol of Indian resistance against British rule. The movement's focus on boycotting British goods and promoting Indian products demonstrated a growing sense of national unity and self-reliance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Swadeshi movement, while initially highly successful in galvanizing mass participation, suffered from a lack of strong organizational structure. The absence of a unified political party framework hindered the movement’s ability to sustain its momentum and translate its popular support into lasting political change. Internal divisions and disagreements among leaders also contributed to its eventual decline.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Partition of Bengal was not a direct cause of India’s independence. While it significantly contributed to the intensification of the nationalist movement, India's independence was achieved much later, after decades of sustained struggle and significant political and social changes. The partition itself was later reversed, underscoring its limited impact on the ultimate goal of independence.


**3. With reference to the militant nationalist leaders of early 20th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment in 1897 for sedition significantly boosted his all-India stature and transformed him into a national figure.
2.  Bipin Chandra Pal, along with Aurobindo Ghose and Tilak, formed the core of the early extremist nationalist leadership in Bengal.
3.  Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, remained largely unaffected by the news of Tilak's activities and the Swadeshi movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tilak's arrest and subsequent trial in 1897 on charges of sedition dramatically increased his national prominence.  The widespread public outrage over his imprisonment transformed him from a regional leader in Maharashtra to a pan-Indian figurehead of the nationalist movement. This event highlighted the growing tension between the British authorities and the nationalist movement and served as a powerful catalyst for further resistance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Bipin Chandra Pal, along with Aurobindo Ghose and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, constituted the core leadership of the early extremist nationalist movement, particularly in Bengal. These three leaders played crucial roles in shaping the ideology and strategy of the movement, advocating for more assertive and radical methods of resistance against British rule. Their combined influence significantly impacted the trajectory of the Indian nationalist struggle.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, was deeply influenced by the news of Tilak's activities and the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. This news significantly shaped his own nationalist views and contributed to his embrace of extremist ideology. The events in India fueled his commitment to the cause of Indian independence and helped define his political trajectory.


**4. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced the principle of separate electorates for Muslims, a move that ultimately deepened communal divisions within Indian society.
2.  The reforms granted Indians a significant majority in the Imperial Legislative Council, leading to a substantial increase in Indian influence on governance.
3.  The reforms were primarily aimed at placating the extremist faction of the Indian National Congress and securing their cooperation with the British government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms, while intended to address some of the demands of Indian nationalists, included the highly controversial introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. This measure, while seemingly aimed at appeasement, had the long-term consequence of exacerbating communal divisions within Indian politics.  Separate electorates reinforced the idea of separate Muslim and Hindu interests, undermining the development of a unified national identity and creating lasting political cleavages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did not give Indians a majority in the Imperial Legislative Council. While the number of Indian members increased, the British retained a significant majority, limiting the actual political influence of Indian representatives. The reforms were carefully designed to maintain British control while making superficial concessions to Indian aspirations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms were not aimed at placating the extremist faction of the Indian National Congress. Instead, they were primarily designed to appease the moderate nationalists, who were seen as more amenable to cooperation with the British government. The reforms were intended to co-opt moderate support while isolating the more radical elements within the nationalist movement.  The government's strategy of divide and rule is evident in this approach.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Indian Polity and Governance during the early 20th century.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab, predating the deportation of Bengal leaders in 1908.
2.  The militant nationalists' program, as articulated by Aurobindo Ghose, involved making the British administration impossible through organized non-cooperation.
3.  Jawaharlal Nehru, while studying in England, remained largely unaffected by the events and nationalist fervor unfolding in India during the early 1900s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in Punjab's canal colonies, before the deportation of nine Bengal leaders in December 1908.  This establishes a correct chronological sequence of events.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurobindo Ghose's articulation of the militant nationalist program is accurately reflected in the provided text. The program aimed to cripple the British administration through organized non-cooperation, encompassing boycotts of British commerce and officialdom.  This highlights the strategic shift towards active resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions Jawaharlal Nehru's strong reaction to events in India, particularly Tilak's activities and conviction, and the mass participation in the Swadeshi movement.  He identifies with the "Tilakites" or Extremists, demonstrating his engagement with the unfolding nationalist struggle.  This contradicts the statement.


**2. With reference to the responses to the Partition of Bengal in 1905, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial anti-partition campaign, led by moderates, primarily employed methods like petitions and public meetings.
2. The Swadeshi movement, which emerged from the anti-partition movement, focused solely on boycotting British goods and had minimal political implications.
3.  The participation of Muslims in the Swadeshi movement was widespread and crucial to its success across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text details the initial moderate-led response to the Partition, emphasizing methods such as petitions, public meetings, and propaganda through newspapers. This accurately portrays the early phase of the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Swadeshi movement initially focused on boycotting British goods, the text clearly demonstrates its significant political implications.  It evolved into a broader political struggle for Swaraj (self-rule) and independence, fuelled by the actions of the Extremists. The statement underestimates the movement's political dimension.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text notes that while some Muslims participated, the majority of upper and middle-class Muslims either stayed away or actively supported the partition. The British government's "divide and rule" policy and the Hindu-centric nature of some aspects of the Swadeshi movement contributed to this limited Muslim participation. This makes the statement inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced the principle of separate electorates exclusively for Hindus, aiming to enhance their representation in the legislative councils.
2.  The reforms significantly increased the number of elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council, granting Indians substantial control over the government.
3.  The reforms were primarily intended to appease the moderate nationalists and isolate the more militant factions of the nationalist movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, not Hindus. This was a significant step that exacerbated communal divisions.  The statement misrepresents the key feature of the reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the reforms did increase the number of elected members, it was not substantial enough to grant Indians significant control.  The elected members were largely indirectly elected, and the officials still held a majority. The statement overstates the impact of the reforms on Indian control.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the reforms were a strategic move by the British government to placate the moderate nationalists while simultaneously isolating and suppressing the more militant factions of the nationalist movement. This reflects the British government's policy of "divide and rule."


**4. With reference to the extremist nationalist movement in India in the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The extremist ideology advocated for obtaining self-government through solely peaceful and constitutional means.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a prominent extremist leader, was imprisoned multiple times for sedition.
3. The Swadeshi Movement, primarily driven by extremist ideology, completely failed to mobilise any sections of Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The extremist ideology, while encompassing non-cooperation and passive resistance, also included extra-constitutional methods to achieve their goals. The statement wrongly depicts the extremist approach as solely peaceful and constitutional.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text mentions Tilak's imprisonment for sedition, highlighting the government's response to extremist activities.  This accurately reflects a key event in the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swadeshi movement, although initially led by moderates, was significantly influenced by extremist ideology and successfully mobilized various sections of Indian society, including students, women, and some segments of the working class.  The statement misrepresents the movement’s reach and impact.


**5.  With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was launched primarily in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the Rowlatt Act.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash occurred between protestors and police, led to the suspension of the movement by Mahatma Gandhi.
3.  The Khilafat movement, focused on the plight of the Ottoman Caliphate, played no role in the Non-Cooperation Movement's success.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement was indeed launched partly in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the Rowlatt Act, which symbolized the oppressive nature of British rule and fueled public outrage.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence and the burning of a police station, profoundly impacted Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.  He believed that non-violence was crucial to the movement's success and the incident highlighted the lack of discipline among some participants.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Khilafat movement, concerning the Ottoman Caliphate, significantly contributed to the Non-Cooperation Movement's initial success by uniting Hindu and Muslim nationalists under a common cause.  The statement wrongly diminishes the Khilafat movement's role.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the relevant historical period and the nuances of the Indian nationalist movement.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's understanding and ability to analyze information critically.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Indian Nationalist Movement.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists primarily focused on achieving complete independence from British rule through immediate and large-scale civil disobedience.
2.  The economic demands of early nationalists included advocating for tariff protection for Indian industries and reducing the drain of wealth to England.
3.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils, largely failed to satisfy nationalist demands for greater Indian representation and power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," initially focused on constitutional methods and gradual reforms within the British Empire.  Their primary goal was not immediate independence but a greater share in governance.  They believed in working within the existing system to achieve their objectives.

Statement 2 is correct.  Early nationalists highlighted India's economic exploitation under British rule, advocating for policies like tariff protection to promote domestic industries and to curb the drain of India's wealth to Britain.  This was a central theme of their economic critique.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did increase the number of members in the councils, but the officials still held a majority.  The Act fell short of the nationalists' demands for substantial Indian representation and meaningful power-sharing, leading to widespread dissatisfaction.  The nationalists viewed it as inadequate and continued to press for further reforms.


**2. With reference to the growth of militant nationalism in India during the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 was a direct response to their advocacy of non-violent non-cooperation with the British government.
2.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on promoting the boycott of British goods and services, while passive resistance was a secondary strategy.
3.  The militant nationalists successfully created a highly organized and unified political party that effectively channeled the energies of the masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the Punjab, highlighting the government's response to unrest and not solely their advocacy of non-violent non-cooperation.  While they were involved in nationalist activities, the immediate cause of their deportation was the unrest they were associated with.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the boycott of British goods was a crucial part of the Swadeshi movement, passive resistance was a central aspect of the militant nationalist strategy, advocating for non-cooperation with the British administration in various spheres.  The two were intertwined and equally important.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Although militant nationalists succeeded in arousing popular enthusiasm, they lacked the organizational capacity to create a truly unified and effective political party to harness the mass movement. Their movement was characterized by a lack of centralized structure and coordination.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was directly linked to core Indian political demands for self-governance.
2.  The Non-Cooperation Movement involved a complete boycott of all British institutions and services, including the military.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the immediate suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khilafat issue galvanized Muslim participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement, it was not directly linked to the core Indian political demands for self-governance.  It served as a catalyst for broader anti-British sentiment but did not inherently address the fundamental political goals of Indian nationalists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement included boycotts of various institutions, but not a complete boycott of the military. While there were calls for some Muslims to leave the army, it wasn't a complete and universal aspect of the movement's strategy.  The movement's approach was more nuanced.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence against the police, directly led Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. This decision stemmed from his commitment to non-violence as a core principle of the movement's strategy.


**4. With reference to the revolutionary terrorist movement in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was primarily focused on achieving independence through non-violent means.
2.  The assassination of a British police officer by Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev was intended as a symbolic act of defiance, rather than a purely violent act.
3.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, demonstrated the limitations of revolutionary terrorism in achieving widespread political change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HRA, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was a revolutionary group that advocated for armed struggle and violent means to overthrow British rule.  Their methods were explicitly violent, unlike the non-violent approach of Gandhi.

Statement 2 is correct. While the assassination was undeniably violent, Bhagat Singh and his comrades justified it as a symbolic act of defiance against the oppressive British regime. Their aim was to challenge the system and arouse national sentiment, not just to eliminate a single individual.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, though bold, highlighted the limitations of small-scale, violent acts in bringing about large-scale political change. It demonstrated the difficulty of sustaining a revolutionary movement through isolated acts of terrorism without broader popular support.  While it was a symbolic act, it did not trigger a mass uprising.


**5. With reference to the events surrounding the partition of India in 1947, consider the following statements:**

1. The Radcliffe Line, demarcating the boundaries between India and Pakistan, was drawn based on a detailed and meticulous survey conducted well before the partition.
2.  The partition led to the displacement of millions of people, resulting in widespread communal violence and loss of life.
3. The assassination of Mahatma Gandhi was directly caused by his advocacy for the partition of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Radcliffe Line was drawn hastily and with limited information, leading to many disputes and injustices. The process was rushed and lacked proper groundwork, resulting in an arbitrary division of territory.

Statement 2 is correct.  The partition of India was accompanied by massive population displacement, resulting in widespread communal violence, loss of life, and immense human suffering. The scale of human tragedy was immense.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Gandhi's views on partition were complex and evolved over time, his assassination was caused by a complex interplay of factors, including extremist Hindu nationalist views on his perceived pro-Muslim stance, and not solely his stand on partition itself.  The assassin's motive was more complex than simply opposing partition.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple factual recall.

**1. With reference to the early Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first session of the Indian National Congress was attended by over 100 delegates and presided over by Dadabhai Naoroji.
2.  Surendranath Banerjea and many Bengal leaders missed the first Congress session due to a concurrent National Conference in Calcutta.
3.  Kadambini Ganguli, the first female graduate of Calcutta University, addressed a Congress session in the 1890s, symbolizing the inclusion of women in the freedom struggle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885 was attended by 72 delegates, not over 100, and was presided over by Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, not Dadabhai Naoroji.  Dadabhai Naoroji later became President on multiple occasions. The question uses a deceptively close but incorrect number of delegates to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Surendranath Banerjea and other Bengal leaders were occupied with the Second National Conference in Calcutta and therefore missed the first Congress session.  This highlights the complex interplay of different nationalist organizations at the time.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text mentions Kadambini Ganguli's address to a Congress session in 1890, signifying the involvement of women in the nationalist movement. The question uses a slightly altered year (1890 instead of a more general "1890s") as a distractor.  The significance of this event for representing the inclusion of women is a key aspect for UPSC-level understanding.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist movement's economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his Drain Theory, argued that British rule led to a gradual but significant drain of wealth from India to Britain, exceeding £40 million annually.
2.  Early nationalists advocated for the immediate abolition of all taxes to alleviate poverty, including the salt tax and land revenue.
3.  The Swadeshi movement involved the promotion of Indian goods and the boycott of British goods to boost domestic industries, with incidents of foreign cloth burning in Maharashtra in 1896.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji's Drain of Wealth theory highlighted the significant transfer of resources from India to Britain under colonial rule. While the exact figure of over £40 million annually might be debated depending on the methodologies, the core argument of a substantial drain is central to his analysis and is a key UPSC concept.  The question uses a specific and potentially debatable figure as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While early nationalists did advocate for tax reduction, particularly of the salt tax and land revenue, they did not call for immediate abolition of *all* taxes. This is a crucial distinction, highlighting the nuanced approach of early nationalists and the deliberate exaggeration in the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly supports the description of the Swadeshi movement, including the burning of foreign cloth in Maharashtra in 1896.  This fact demonstrates understanding of the movement's methods and impact.


**3. With reference to the early nationalist movement's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists demanded the complete replacement of all British administrative officials with Indians, arguing that this would make the administration more efficient and cost-effective.
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, in 1897, argued against the Indianisation of higher administrative services on moral grounds, stating that it would lead to a "dwarfing" of the Indian race.
3.  Nationalists advocated for the separation of judicial and executive powers, opposing the curtailment of jury powers and the disarming of the Indian populace.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While early nationalists strongly advocated for the Indianisation of administrative services, they did not demand the *complete* replacement of all British officials.  This demonstrates the difference between a nuanced historical understanding and an oversimplified interpretation.  The statement uses an absolute term ("complete") to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gokhale's 1897 argument *supported* the Indianisation of higher administrative services, highlighting the moral imperative of ending the "dwarfing" of the Indian race caused by a system of inherent inferiority.  The question reverses Gokhale's actual position to test for deep understanding.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the nationalist demands for the separation of judicial and executive powers, the protection of jury powers, and the right of Indians to bear arms. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific policy demands.


**4. With reference to the differences between Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose wholeheartedly embraced Western-style socialism as the ideal economic model for independent India.
2.  Bose believed that non-violent resistance alone could secure India's independence, while Gandhi advocated for a more flexible approach that could incorporate violence if necessary.
3.  Gandhi strictly adhered to the principle that means and ends must be equally virtuous, while Bose prioritized achieving independence, even if it meant employing less-than-ideal means.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both were interested in socialist ideals, they had different interpretations. Gandhi was critical of Western-style socialism associated with industrialization, favoring a more decentralized, village-based approach. Bose, while also a socialist, was more open to modernization and industrialization. The question uses a broad, inaccurate generalization to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bose was a strong critic of Gandhi's reliance on non-violent resistance, believing that a more militant approach was necessary to achieve independence. Gandhi, conversely, remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violence.  The statement reverses their actual positions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Gandhi's philosophy emphasized the importance of moral means, while Bose was more pragmatic, focusing on the outcome of achieving independence even if it required alliances with less-than-ideal actors like the Axis powers during World War II. This tests the candidate's understanding of their differing ethical frameworks.


**5. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission offered India complete independence immediately upon the conclusion of World War II, with no conditions attached.
2.  The mission proposed a constituent assembly for India, with members elected entirely through proportional representation by provincial assemblies.
3.  A significant point of contention was the proposal that provinces could opt out of the Indian Union, creating a potential path towards partition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission offered dominion status, not complete independence immediately.  The offer of independence was conditional and contingent upon the post-war scenario. The statement presents a misleading oversimplification of the mission's proposal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The proposed constituent assembly would have members partly elected by provincial assemblies and partly nominated by the princely states. The statement omits the crucial detail of princely state nomination to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The option for provinces to secede from the Indian Union was a key element of the Cripps proposal and a major source of opposition from the Indian National Congress, as it directly contradicted the idea of a unified India. This tests knowledge of a key aspect of the mission's failure.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian history related to the nationalist movement, socialist ideas, and revolutionary activities during the early 20th century.


**1. With reference to the revolutionary terrorist movement in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), founded in 1924, initially aimed to establish a federal republic based on adult franchise.
2.  The assassination of Lala Lajpat Rai directly triggered the change of the HRA's name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).
3. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was primarily motivated by the desire to assassinate key British officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The HRA's initial aim, as stated in the provided text, was to overthrow the colonial government and establish a Federal Republic of the United States of India with adult franchise as a core principle.  This reflects the early revolutionary vision of a unified and democratic India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Lala Lajpat Rai's death was a significant event, it didn't directly cause the name change. The HRA transitioned to the HSRA in 1928 primarily due to the growing influence of socialist ideologies among the revolutionaries. The death of Lajpat Rai, however, fueled further revolutionary actions, like the assassination of Saunders.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, though a significant act of revolutionary terrorism, wasn't primarily focused on assassinations.  Its main objective was to seize arms and disrupt government infrastructure, aiming to spark a larger rebellion. The raid highlights the shift towards more organized and large-scale revolutionary action in Bengal.  The focus was on acquiring resources for a broader revolt, not targeted killings.



**2. With reference to the responses to the Simon Commission and the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, unequivocally advocated for immediate complete independence for India.
2. The Simon Commission's all-British composition was a major factor leading to its widespread boycott in India.
3. The Muslim League's support for the Nehru Report was unconditional and unwavering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nehru Report, while advocating for significant constitutional reforms, did not call for immediate complete independence.  It proposed Dominion Status as the next immediate step, reflecting a more gradualist approach to self-rule.  This highlights the internal debates within the nationalist movement regarding the pace and methods of achieving independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The all-British composition of the Simon Commission deeply offended Indian nationalists, who saw it as a symbol of British disregard for Indian self-determination. This led to a unified and widespread boycott across various political groups, temporarily setting aside their differences.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League's response to the Nehru Report was far from unconditional.  While initially supportive of certain aspects, significant disagreements, particularly regarding separate electorates and the distribution of power, led to its eventual rejection by a section of the League. This underscores the growing communal tensions and the challenges in achieving national unity during this period.



**3. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Gandhi and Bose firmly believed in the necessity of a completely non-violent approach to achieving Indian independence.
2. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II stemmed from a deep ideological affinity with fascism.
3. Gandhi's vision of Ram Rajya emphasized decentralized governance and a stateless society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi was a staunch advocate of non-violence (ahimsa), Bose believed that violent resistance might be necessary to achieve independence, especially given the opportunity presented by the global context of World War II.  This highlights the differing strategic approaches within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers was primarily a pragmatic strategic decision aimed at leveraging their resources and weakening the British Empire during the war.  It wasn't based on an ideological alignment with fascism, although he admired certain aspects like discipline and organization.  His writings demonstrate a commitment to democratic and egalitarian ideals that contradicted the core tenets of fascism.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's concept of Ram Rajya,  his ideal state, envisioned a decentralized, stateless society based on self-governance at the village level.  This reflects his preference for local autonomy and a moral, rather than a centralized, political order.  This ideal is a crucial component of understanding his political philosophy and its implications for the future of India.


**4. With reference to the economic and social ideas of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi advocated for large-scale industrialization as a means to alleviate poverty and unemployment in India.
2. Bose supported the complete abolition of the caste system as a prerequisite for national progress.
3. Gandhi's economic philosophy emphasized self-sufficiency at the village level and rejected large-scale industrialization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi was critical of large-scale industrialization, viewing it as potentially harmful to the environment and detrimental to traditional crafts and village economies. He championed the charkha (spinning wheel) as a symbol of self-reliance and decentralized production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bose strongly opposed untouchability and social inequality, the text doesn't explicitly state that he advocated for the complete abolition of the caste system as a *prerequisite* for national progress.  His focus was on creating a more egalitarian society, but the approach to achieving this wasn't solely tied to abolishing the caste system.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhi's vision of the Indian economy centered on self-sufficient villages, with emphasis on traditional crafts and decentralized production. He believed this approach would foster economic equality and sustainability, contrasting sharply with the path of large-scale industrialization.  This highlights his unique approach to economic development.


**5. With reference to the events leading up to and during the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre were significant catalysts for the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was entirely unrelated to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against the police, led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, which curtailed civil liberties, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a brutal act of state violence, fueled widespread anger and resentment, creating a fertile ground for the Non-Cooperation Movement.  These events exposed the repressive nature of British rule and galvanized opposition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Khilafat issue, concerning the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate after World War I, was a crucial factor in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.  It provided a powerful unifying factor and helped forge a broad-based Hindu-Muslim alliance against British rule.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob attacked and burned a police station, resulting in deaths, led Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement due to concerns about escalating violence.  This decision, though controversial, highlights Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence as a core principle of the movement.  This event drastically altered the course of the movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi vehemently opposed violence as a means to achieve political goals, while Bose believed that violent resistance was necessary to overthrow colonial rule.
2.  Gandhi advocated for a decentralized, village-based economy, while Bose championed industrialization and state-controlled economic planning.
3.  Both Gandhi and Bose supported socialist ideals, although their interpretations of socialism differed significantly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the core ideological differences between Gandhi and Bose.  Statement 1 highlights their contrasting approaches to the struggle for independence: Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and satyagraha, versus Bose's belief in the efficacy of forceful resistance, even allying with Axis powers strategically.  Statement 2 correctly contrasts their economic visions: Gandhi's emphasis on rural self-sufficiency and Gram Swaraj, versus Bose's advocacy for rapid industrialization and state-led planning, drawing inspiration from the Soviet model. Statement 3 is also accurate; both leaders espoused socialist principles, but their interpretations diverged significantly.  Gandhi's socialism was rooted in traditional Indian values and village self-sufficiency, while Bose's vision was more aligned with modern, state-directed industrial socialism.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all three statements is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of their complex ideological differences.


**2. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission proposed the immediate transfer of significant power to an Indian interim government.
2.  The mission offered dominion status to India after the war, with the option to secede from the Commonwealth.
3. The Muslim League wholeheartedly endorsed the Cripps Mission's proposals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did not propose the immediate transfer of substantial power.  Defense and the Governor-General's powers remained largely in British hands. Statement 2 is correct.  The mission offered dominion status after the war, with the crucial provision allowing any province to opt out of the Indian Union and negotiate a separate agreement with Britain—a key element that ultimately contributed to the mission’s failure. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League, while initially welcoming certain aspects, ultimately rejected the Cripps proposals due to concerns regarding the lack of explicit provisions for the creation of Pakistan and the perceived threat to Muslim self-determination. Thus, only statement 2 is correct, making option (a) the appropriate answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the facts of the Cripps Mission.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a police station was attacked and burned, led to the suspension of the movement.
2.  The movement's objective was to achieve complete independence (Purna Swaraj) from British rule.
3. The Khilafat movement played a significant role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence and loss of life, deeply troubled Gandhi, leading him to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement to reinforce the principle of non-violence. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ultimate goal was Swaraj, the Non-Cooperation Movement's initial objective was not explicitly Purna Swaraj.  Complete independence became a more prominent demand later. Statement 3 is correct. The Khilafat movement, focused on defending the Ottoman Caliphate, successfully brought a substantial number of Indian Muslims into the fold of the Non-Cooperation Movement, significantly broadening its base. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement's goals and events.


**4. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Congress initially focused primarily on achieving dominion status within the British Empire.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
3. The Moderates' political strategy primarily involved non-violent, constitutional methods of protest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The initial focus of the Indian National Congress was not on dominion status.  Their early demands were more moderate, focusing on administrative reforms and increased Indian participation in governance. Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" was a crucial contribution to the early nationalist movement, exposing the economic exploitation of India through the transfer of wealth to Britain. Statement 3 is correct. The Moderates primarily employed non-violent, constitutional methods, such as petitions, resolutions, and participation in legislative councils, to advocate for reforms.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the characteristics of the early nationalist phase.


**5.  With reference to the revolutionary movements in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), primarily focused on assassinating individual British officials.
2.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant example of armed rebellion in Bengal.
3.  Bhagat Singh and his associates advocated for a socialist revolution in India, going beyond mere national independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplified. While the HRA/HSRA did engage in individual assassinations (like Saunders), their later phase shifted towards broader revolutionary goals, including mass mobilization. Statement 2 is correct.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid was a bold act of armed rebellion, showcasing a different approach to revolutionary struggle in Bengal. Statement 3 is correct. Bhagat Singh and his comrades explicitly advocated for a socialist revolution in India, aiming to dismantle class exploitation alongside achieving national independence.  Thus, statements 2 and 3 are accurate, making (b) the correct choice. Option (a) is an incomplete representation, while (c) and (d) misrepresent the nuances of the revolutionary movements.


**6. With reference to Gandhi's and Nehru's views on the Indian state, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi envisioned a decentralized state with village republics as the basic units of governance, while Nehru favored a more centralized, modern state.
2.  Gandhi was deeply religious, while Nehru held a more secular perspective.
3. Both Gandhi and Nehru were staunch proponents of industrialization as a means of national development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the differing visions of Gandhi and Nehru regarding the structure of the Indian state. Gandhi's ideal was a decentralized system of self-governing village republics, while Nehru favoured a strong, centralized state capable of driving modernization and development. Statement 2 is also correct.  Gandhi's political philosophy was deeply intertwined with his religious beliefs, while Nehru's approach was more secular, emphasizing rationalism and scientific progress. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Nehru was a strong advocate for industrialization, Gandhi held a more nuanced view, emphasizing rural development and cautioning against the negative social consequences of uncontrolled industrialization. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the right option.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the subtleties of their contrasting views.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Morley-Minto Reforms (1909):**

1. The reforms significantly increased the number of elected Indian members in the legislative councils.
2.  Separate electorates were introduced for Muslims under these reforms.
3. The reforms granted Indians substantial control over the Indian budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially true but misleading. While the reforms did increase the number of elected members, the increase was modest and most were indirectly elected, limiting the extent of direct representation. Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims, allowing them to elect their own representatives to the councils.  This had long-term consequences. Statement 3 is incorrect. The reforms did not grant Indians control over the budget.  The British retained significant control over financial matters. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) include inaccurate or incomplete assertions regarding the Morley-Minto Reforms.



**8.  With reference to the partition of Bengal (1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was primarily aimed at improving administrative efficiency in the Bengal Presidency.
2. The Swadeshi and Boycott Movement emerged as a direct response to the partition.
3.  The partition led to increased Hindu-Muslim unity in Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British government claimed the partition was for administrative efficiency, it was widely viewed as a deliberate attempt to weaken the growing nationalist movement in Bengal by dividing the Bengali population. Statement 2 is correct. The partition sparked widespread protests and resentment, leading to the emergence of the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement as a powerful form of resistance. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The partition, instead of fostering unity, exacerbated existing tensions and contributed to the growth of communal politics in Bengal.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate, making (c) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the historical context and consequences of the partition of Bengal.


**9. With reference to the activities of the Indian National Congress during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajist Party, formed after the Non-Cooperation Movement, advocated for participation in legislative councils as a means of political struggle.
2. The No-Changers within the Congress opposed the Swarajists' decision to enter legislative councils.
3.  The Congress remained unified and avoided any significant internal divisions during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Swarajist Party, led by prominent figures like C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, adopted a strategy of entering legislative councils to oppose British policies from within. Statement 2 is also correct. The No-Changers, a faction within the Congress, strongly opposed the Swarajists' decision, preferring to focus on constructive work and maintaining the boycott of councils. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 1920s witnessed significant internal divisions within the Congress, primarily centered around the issue of council entry, resulting in the formation of distinct factions like the Swarajists and No-Changers. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct. Option (a) accurately reflects this situation. Options (b), (c), and (d) either contain inaccuracies or present an incomplete picture of the Congress's internal dynamics during the 1920s.


**10. With reference to the growth of socialist and communist ideas in India during the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) was directly influenced by the Russian Revolution.
2.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case involved the arrest and trial of several prominent communist and trade union leaders.
3. Socialist and communist ideas had minimal impact on the Indian nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union profoundly influenced the emergence of socialist and communist groups in India, contributing to the formation of the CPI. Statement 2 is also correct. The Meerut Conspiracy Case was a significant event, demonstrating the government's response to the growing communist and trade union movements. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Socialist and communist ideas significantly influenced the Indian nationalist movement, particularly among younger leaders who advocated for a more radical, socialist-oriented approach to national liberation. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct. Option (a) accurately reflects the influence and impact of socialist and communist thought in India during the 1920s. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical context and the extent of their influence on the nationalist movement.


**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The British India Association, formed in 1851, was a merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily advocating for landlord interests.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's East India Association, established in London in 1866, aimed to influence British public opinion on Indian welfare and  primarily focused on economic issues.
3. The Indian Association, founded in 1876, was spearheaded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, advocating for wider public interests beyond the limited scope of existing organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the British India Association was indeed formed by a merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society in 1851, it's inaccurate to say it *primarily* advocated for landlord interests.  While initially representing primarily landed interests, the association broadened its scope to encompass broader public concerns as it evolved.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Dadabhai Naoroji established the East India Association in London in 1866.  Its primary goal was to lobby the British government and public for Indian interests.  While it did address broader issues, Naoroji's focus on economic exploitation and the "drain of wealth" from India is well-documented, making the statement about its primary focus on economic matters largely accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Association, founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, actively campaigned for broader Indian interests and played a significant role in the rise of Indian nationalism. It represented a shift towards more sustained and widespread political agitation compared to its predecessors.  Its focus extended beyond the concerns of the wealthy elite and aimed to mobilize wider public opinion.


**2. With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, established in the 1870s, primarily focused on criticizing administrative and legislative measures and published a journal under Justice Ranade's guidance.
2. The Madras Mahajan Sabha, founded in 1881, and the Bombay Presidency Association, established in 1885, were primarily regional organizations with limited all-India impact.
3. The Indian Association of Calcutta, established in 1876, played a crucial role in fostering all-India political unity and organizing the Indian National Conference in 1883.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, established in the 1870s under the leadership of prominent figures like Justice Ranade, played a crucial role in shaping nationalist thought in Maharashtra.  Its focus on criticizing government policies and publishing a journal that guided intellectual discourse is well-documented.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Madras Mahajan Sabha and the Bombay Presidency Association were influential regional organizations, their impact remained largely confined to their respective presidencies. They did not achieve the level of all-India influence or coordination that the Indian National Congress later achieved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Indian Association of Calcutta was indeed instrumental in advocating for broader Indian interests and did organize the 1883 Indian National Conference,  attributing to it a *crucial* role in fostering all-India political unity is an overstatement.  The Indian National Congress played a far more significant role in achieving all-India political unity than the Indian Association.  The Conference was a step towards broader unity, but the Congress itself later became the primary vehicle for this goal.


**3. With reference to the formation of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, is solely credited with the idea and execution of the Indian National Congress's formation in 1885.
2. The first session of the Indian National Congress, held in Bombay in December 1885, was attended by 72 delegates and aimed to promote friendly relations between nationalist workers across India.
3. The "safety valve" theory, suggesting the Congress was created to prevent a major uprising, is the sole explanation for its founding, fully representing Hume's motivations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While A.O. Hume played a pivotal role in organizing the first session of the Indian National Congress, it's inaccurate to credit him *solely* with the idea and execution.  Several Indian leaders were involved in the planning and initiation of the Congress.  Attributing sole credit to Hume overlooks the significant contribution of Indian nationalists who saw the need for an all-India political organization.

Statement 2 is correct. The first session of the Indian National Congress, held in Bombay in December 1885, was attended by 72 delegates.  Its aims included fostering unity among Indian nationalists from different regions and presenting collective demands to the government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "safety valve" theory, which suggests that the Congress was created to channel popular discontent and prevent a major uprising, is only a partial explanation for its founding.  While this was a consideration for some British officials like Hume,  the Congress also represented the growing desire among Indian nationalists for a unified platform to advance their political and economic goals.  Hume's motivations were complex and not solely driven by the "safety valve" concern.  The statement's assertion that this is the *sole* explanation is a significant oversimplification.


**4. With reference to the initial aims and activities of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily focused on demanding immediate complete independence ("purna swaraj") from British rule.
2.  Economic reforms were a central focus, with nationalists advocating for tariff protection, government aid for industries, and the promotion of "swadeshi" (Indian goods).
3.  The demand for Indianization of higher administrative services was based solely on moral grounds, emphasizing the need to end the perceived racial inferiority complex within Indian society.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The early nationalists, during the period 1885-1905, did *not* primarily advocate for immediate complete independence.  Their initial demands were more moderate, focusing on gradual reforms within the existing system. The demand for "purna swaraj" emerged later in the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Economic concerns were central to the early nationalist agenda.  The "drain of wealth" to Britain, the decline of Indian industries, and the impoverishment of the peasantry were major criticisms.  Nationalists advocated for policies like tariff protection and government support for Indian industries, promoting the use of "swadeshi" goods as a means of economic self-reliance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The demand for Indianization of higher administrative services was based on multiple grounds, not solely on moral ones.  Economic arguments (higher costs of employing Europeans, the drain of wealth through their salaries and pensions) and political arguments (making the administration more responsive to Indian needs) were also crucial factors in advocating for Indianization.  While the moral aspect of ending racial discrimination was a component of the argument, it wasn't the sole basis.


**5. With reference to the events leading up to and including the Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat movement, focused on the treatment of Turkey after World War I, was unrelated to Indian political aspirations and did not contribute to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the Hunter Committee's findings significantly fueled discontent and contributed to the atmosphere leading to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
3. Gandhi's initial proposal for non-cooperation received unanimous support from within the Congress, with no significant opposition from leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khilafat movement, while focused on the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate, was deeply intertwined with Indian political aspirations.  It provided a crucial platform for Hindu-Muslim unity and significantly contributed to the momentum and widespread participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The shared opposition to British rule created a powerful alliance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the perceived inadequacy of the Hunter Committee's investigation into the Punjab atrocities were major catalysts in fueling widespread Indian discontent.  These events severely damaged the credibility of the British government and contributed to the atmosphere in which the Non-Cooperation Movement gained traction.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Gandhi's initial proposal for non-cooperation faced significant opposition within the Congress, particularly from leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who had reservations about the alliance with Muslim leaders on a religious issue and was skeptical of Satyagraha as a political tool.  While Gandhi eventually managed to secure support for his program, it was not initially unanimous.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of the Indian freedom struggle.  Each question adheres to the specified formatting and difficulty criteria.


**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the Punjab canal colonies in 1907.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's imprisonment in 1908 stemmed from his advocacy of passive resistance and Swadeshi.
3.  The arrest of Chidambaram Pillai in Madras was unrelated to the anti-partition movement in Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab's canal colonies. This highlights the government's response to growing nationalist sentiment and unrest in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the text doesn't directly link Tilak's 1908 arrest solely to passive resistance and Swadeshi, it does mention his arrest and a harsh sentence in that year, within the context of the rising militant nationalism that embraced these strategies.  His activities and conviction were significant in fueling the unrest across India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the text doesn't detail the specific reasons for Chidambaram Pillai's arrest, it mentions his imprisonment within the broader context of the growing nationalist movement and repression against its leaders during this period.  The anti-partition movement in Bengal served as a catalyst for similar uprisings in other parts of India, making it highly probable that his arrest was connected to the burgeoning nationalist sentiment.  The statement attempts to create a false sense of isolation for Pillai's case.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Partition of Bengal (1905) on the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1905 Congress session, under Gokhale's presidency, unanimously condemned the partition and supported the Swadeshi movement.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's 1906 presidential address at the Calcutta Congress session advocated for "self-government" or Swaraj.
3. The Surat split of 1907 solidified the unity between moderate and extremist factions within the Congress, leading to a more cohesive national movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Congress's response to the Partition of Bengal.  The text clearly indicates that the 1905 session under Gokhale condemned the partition and supported the ensuing Swadeshi movement. This demonstrates the Congress's growing willingness to confront British policies directly.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text explicitly states that Dadabhai Naoroji, in his 1906 presidential address, declared the goal of the Indian national movement to be "self-government" or Swaraj, a significant shift towards more assertive demands for Indian autonomy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Surat split of 1907 dramatically *divided* the Congress into moderate and extremist factions, weakening the national movement's effectiveness and highlighting the internal conflicts that hindered its progress.  The statement presents a false narrative of unity resulting from the split.


**3. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in early 20th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurobindo Ghosh's political philosophy emphasized making British administration impossible through organized non-cooperation.
2.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on boycotting foreign goods and did not involve any calls for political self-rule.
3.  The establishment of national educational institutions like the Bengal National College was a direct consequence of the British government's suppression of nationalist educational activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text quotes Aurobindo Ghosh directly, outlining his strategy of making British administration unworkable through organized non-cooperation, a key element of militant nationalism.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The text explicitly links the creation of national educational institutions, such as the Bengal National College, to the British government's suppression of nationalist educational activities.  This showcases the nationalists' response to government repression by creating alternative systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Swadeshi movement did involve boycotting foreign goods, it was intrinsically linked to the larger goal of achieving political self-rule (Swaraj), as evidenced by the evolving rhetoric of the movement and the statements of key leaders like Aurobindo Ghosh and Tilak. The statement misrepresents the scope and objectives of the Swadeshi movement by downplaying its political dimensions.


**4.  With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced the principle of separate electorates for Muslims, granting them representation exceeding their population proportion.
2.  The reforms led to the establishment of fully responsible government in India, mirroring the British parliamentary system.
3.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale played a significant role in advocating for the reforms within the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a significant step that had long-term consequences for communal politics in India.  The reforms also gave Muslims representation exceeding their population proportion, a contentious aspect of the reforms.

Statement 3 is also correct.  While Gokhale's role wasn't directly in *advocating for* the specific features of the Morley-Minto Reforms as presented (he advocated for self-government), his presence in England at the time, meeting with John Morley, and his position within the Congress make it highly likely he was involved in the negotiations and discussions surrounding the reforms.  The statement uses subtle wordplay to create a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did *not* establish a fully responsible government in India.  They introduced limited electoral representation but retained significant British control over the administration. The statement is a clear and significant misrepresentation of the reforms' impact.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22):**

1. The movement's launch was directly linked to the British government's treatment of Turkey after World War I.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, led to the movement's suspension by Mahatma Gandhi.
3.  The movement successfully achieved complete independence for India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat issue, stemming from the British government's post-World War I treatment of Turkey, provided a crucial impetus for the launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The shared concern for the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate united Hindus and Muslims, broadening the movement's base.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, prompted Mahatma Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, highlighting his commitment to non-violent resistance.  This decision, though controversial at the time, reflects a key aspect of Gandhi's leadership.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement did not achieve complete independence for India.  It was a significant step in the freedom struggle, but independence came much later.  The statement is a blatant falsehood designed as a distractor.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian history, particularly the nationalist movement and British policies, demanding detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh in 1907 followed riots in the canal colonies of Punjab, signifying the growing unrest against British rule.
2.  Aurobindo Ghose's advocacy of "passive resistance" alongside Swadeshi and Boycott aimed to make British administration impossible through organized non-cooperation.
3.  The militant nationalists effectively harnessed the energies of the Indian masses, creating a sound organization to guide the movement and achieve widespread mobilization across rural and urban India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The deportations of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed unrest in the Punjab's canal colonies, highlighting the escalating tensions and the British response to nationalist sentiment.  This event is a crucial element in understanding the growing militancy within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurobindo Ghose's strategy of passive resistance, combined with Swadeshi and Boycott, aimed to cripple the British administration through non-cooperation. This approach represents a significant shift towards more assertive forms of resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the militant nationalists successfully aroused the populace, they lacked effective organizational capacity and failed to reach the broader peasant masses. Their movement largely remained confined to urban areas and did not translate into a unified, nationwide mobilization effort.  This failure to create a robust organizational structure and reach the rural population is a key factor in understanding the limitations of the militant nationalist phase. The absence of a cohesive organizational structure hindered the long-term success of the movement.


**2. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India during the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The assassination of unpopular British officials, inspired by Irish and Russian revolutionary tactics, marked the beginning of revolutionary terrorism in India.
2.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent revolutionary organization, primarily focused on mass mobilization and widespread uprisings to overthrow British rule.
3.  Revolutionary terrorism, while failing to achieve its immediate objectives of expelling the British, significantly contributed to the growth of nationalist pride and sentiment in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the historical trajectory of revolutionary terrorism. The assassination of British officials, drawing inspiration from the tactics of Irish and Russian revolutionaries, became a defining feature of this movement. This strategy, though controversial, played a role in shaping the overall nationalist struggle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anushilan Samiti, while influential, primarily focused on targeted actions against British officials and symbols of authority.  It did not prioritize mass mobilization and widespread uprisings as its central strategy.  The organization operated largely through clandestine networks and focused on specific acts of violence rather than large-scale revolutionary campaigns.

Statement 3 correctly assesses the impact of revolutionary terrorism. Despite its inability to directly expel the British, it instilled a sense of pride and defiance among Indians, contributing significantly to the overall growth of nationalist sentiment. The heroism and sacrifice of the revolutionaries, even if their methods were not universally accepted, resonated with many Indians, fostering a sense of national unity and resolve.  Their actions served to bolster nationalist sentiments, even if they did not directly lead to political independence.



**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress (1905-1914), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1905 session of the Indian National Congress, presided over by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, strongly condemned Lord Curzon's reactionary regime and the Partition of Bengal.
2.  The Surat split of 1907 decisively separated the moderate and extremist factions within the Congress, leading to a long-term weakening of the nationalist movement.
3.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, while offering some constitutional concessions, ultimately failed to address the core demands of the Indian nationalists for self-governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, president of the 1905 Congress session, unequivocally condemned Lord Curzon's policies and the Partition of Bengal, highlighting the Congress's unified opposition to these measures. This condemnation reflected the widespread discontent with British rule and the growing nationalist sentiment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Surat split of 1907 significantly divided the Congress, characterizing it as a long-term weakening of the nationalist movement is an oversimplification.  The nationalist movement continued to evolve, with both moderate and extremist factions contributing to the overall struggle for independence.  The split, while disruptive, did not permanently cripple the nationalist movement; it rather reflected the internal tensions and differing strategies within the movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms, while introducing some limited electoral representation, failed to satisfy the nationalists' demands for substantial self-governance. The reforms fell short of addressing the fundamental issue of Indian control over its own political destiny.  The reforms were perceived as insufficient and ultimately did little to alleviate the underlying tensions and demands for self-rule.  The limited nature of the reforms and their failure to grant meaningful self-governance contributed to the ongoing nationalist struggle.


**4. With reference to the methods of political work employed by early Indian nationalists (pre-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Moderate nationalists primarily relied on constitutional agitation, petitions, and public appeals to British authorities to achieve gradual political progress.
2.  The early nationalists consistently advocated for the complete expulsion of the British from India, rejecting any form of cooperation or compromise with the colonial government.
3.  Moderate nationalists actively engaged in propaganda in Britain, aiming to educate British public opinion and garner support for Indian demands for reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the approach of moderate nationalists.  They primarily focused on constitutional means, using petitions, public meetings, and appeals to the British government to achieve incremental political reforms. This strategy reflected their belief in gradual progress within the existing political framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Early nationalists, particularly the moderates, did not uniformly advocate for the immediate and complete expulsion of the British.  Many believed in a gradual process of reform and achieving self-governance within the framework of the British Empire.  This nuanced approach reflects the diverse strategies and ideologies within the early nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is correct. Moderate nationalists recognized the importance of influencing British public opinion. They actively engaged in propaganda campaigns in Britain, sending delegations and publishing journals to advocate for Indian interests and reforms. This trans-national dimension of their political strategy aimed to garner support from within the British political system.  This demonstrates an understanding of the importance of international pressure in colonial contexts.


**5. With reference to the British Government's attitude towards the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British initially viewed the Indian National Congress with suspicion, labeling nationalist leaders as "disloyal babus" and "seditious brahmins".
2.  The British consistently pursued a policy of complete suppression of the nationalist movement, employing harsh repressive measures from the very beginning.
3.  The British Government employed a "divide and rule" strategy, encouraging pro-British elements to counter the influence of the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the British initial response to the nationalist movement.  The British administration viewed the Congress with suspicion, employing derogatory labels to discredit nationalist leaders and undermine their credibility. This initial suspicion stemmed from the potential threat the Congress posed to British authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British employed repressive measures against the nationalist movement at various points, their approach was not consistently one of complete suppression from the outset.  There were periods of relative tolerance, and the British also sought to co-opt certain aspects of the nationalist movement through concessions and divide-and-rule tactics.  The British response was more nuanced than a simple policy of consistent and total suppression.

Statement 3 is correct. The British consistently employed a "divide and rule" strategy to weaken the nationalist movement. They fostered divisions along communal, regional, and caste lines, supporting pro-British elements to counter the growing influence of the Congress. This strategy aimed at preventing a unified national front against British rule. The "divide and rule" policy is a key element in understanding the methods employed by the British to maintain control over India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects related to the historical context of the Partition of Bengal and its aftermath.


**1. With reference to the Partition of Bengal in 1905, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was primarily intended to improve administrative efficiency by separating linguistically distinct regions within the province.
2.  The partition was met with vehement opposition from Bengali nationalists who viewed it as an attempt to weaken the burgeoning nationalist movement.
3.  Moderate nationalist leaders such as Surendranath Banerjea initially led the anti-partition movement, while militant nationalists played a more prominent role later.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British administration cited administrative convenience as a justification, the primary motive behind the Partition of Bengal was to weaken the growing nationalist movement in Bengal by dividing its population and hindering communication and coordination among nationalists.  The stated administrative reasons were largely a pretext.

Statement 2 is correct. The partition was deeply resented by Bengali nationalists who saw it as a deliberate attempt to divide and weaken their collective identity and political strength.  The movement against the partition became a powerful symbol of Indian nationalism.

Statement 3 is correct.  The initial response to the partition was led by moderate nationalist leaders like Surendranath Banerjea and Krishna Kumar Mitra. However, as the British response became increasingly repressive, militant and revolutionary nationalists gained prominence in the movement, leading to a more radical phase of the anti-partition struggle.  The cooperation between moderate and militant nationalists is a key aspect of the movement's success.



**2. With reference to the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement solely focused on economic boycotts of British goods, with little emphasis on political action.
2.  The Swadeshi movement significantly boosted Indian industries, leading to the establishment of new textile mills, soap factories, and other enterprises.
3.  The movement witnessed significant participation from students and women, who played a crucial role in picketing and promoting Swadeshi ideals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swadeshi and Boycott Movement was not solely an economic boycott. While the boycott of British goods was a central component, it was intrinsically linked to broader political goals, aiming to express resistance against British rule and demonstrate the power of collective Indian action.  The economic aspect was a powerful tool for achieving political objectives.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Swadeshi movement provided a crucial impetus to Indian industries.  The boycott of British goods created a demand for domestically produced alternatives, leading to the growth of various industries and the establishment of new enterprises, contributing to the development of indigenous capacity.

Statement 3 is correct. Students and women were actively involved in the Swadeshi movement.  Students played a pivotal role in picketing shops selling foreign goods and spreading Swadeshi ideals among the population.  The participation of women, who traditionally held a more domestic role, marked a significant shift in their involvement in the nationalist movement.  Their participation in public protests and picketing was a notable development.



**3. With reference to the consequences of the Anti-Partition Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement's success led to the immediate annulment of the Partition of Bengal, demonstrating the effectiveness of mass mobilization in influencing British policy.
2. The movement's failure to significantly engage the peasantry of Bengal highlighted the limitations of urban-centric nationalist movements.
3. The movement's emphasis on Swadeshi and Boycott contributed to a cultural flourishing, evident in the rise of nationalist literature, poetry, and journalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Partition of Bengal was not immediately annulled due to the Anti-Partition Movement. Although the movement put immense pressure on the British government, the annulment came years later in 1911, as a result of a complex interplay of factors including the changing political context and the British government's own strategic calculations. The movement's immediate impact was less about a direct reversal of the partition and more about galvanizing nationalist sentiment and shaping the future trajectory of the freedom struggle.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Anti-Partition Movement enjoyed considerable support in urban areas, its penetration into the rural areas of Bengal remained limited.  This reflects a characteristic of many early nationalist movements in India, which often had a stronger presence in urban centers than in rural communities. The movement's limited reach into the rural peasantry points to the challenges of mobilizing a truly mass-based movement across diverse social strata.

Statement 3 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, a core element of the Anti-Partition Movement, fostered a significant cultural upsurge.  The boycott of British goods spurred the creation of Indian alternatives, promoting local industries and arts. This period saw a notable flowering of nationalist literature, poetry, and journalism, reflecting the movement's broader cultural and intellectual impact, shaping the cultural landscape of Bengal and influencing the nationalist movement as a whole.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the growth of militancy within the Indian nationalist movement:**

1. The early success of moderate nationalist strategies in achieving political concessions contributed to the rise of militant nationalism.
2. The government's repressive policies, including the suppression of the press and the imprisonment of nationalist leaders, fueled the growth of militant and revolutionary groups.
3.  The increasing Hindu-Muslim unity during this period played a crucial role in moderating the growth of militant nationalism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early failures of moderate nationalist strategies, rather than their successes, contributed to the rise of militant nationalism.  The lack of significant concessions from the British government and the perceived ineffectiveness of moderate methods led to frustration among some nationalists, pushing them towards more radical approaches.

Statement 2 is correct.  The British government's repressive policies played a significant role in the rise of militant nationalism.  The suppression of the press, the imprisonment of nationalist leaders, and the use of force against peaceful protests created an environment of anger and frustration, contributing to the growth of revolutionary and militant groups who adopted more radical methods of resistance.  The repressive response often had the unintended consequence of radicalizing sections of the nationalist movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Increasing Hindu-Muslim unity, while a desirable goal for nationalists, did not play a significant role in *moderating* the growth of militant nationalism.  The period witnessed both instances of cooperation and instances of communal tension, which had complex and often contradictory effects on the overall trajectory of the nationalist movement.  Communal relations were a factor, but not the primary driver of the shift towards militancy. The rise of militant nationalism was largely a response to British repression and the perceived ineffectiveness of moderate strategies.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the themes of labor movements, revolutionary terrorism, and the political landscape of India during the early 20th century.


**1. With reference to early 20th-century Indian labor movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bombay textile mill strike of the late 1920s involved over 150,000 workers and lasted for more than five months, with communist leadership playing a significant role.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose actively participated in mediating a major strike at the Tata Iron and Steel Works in Jamshedpur.
3.  The total number of workers participating in strikes across India in 1928 exceeded five million.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the scale and duration of the Bombay textile mill strike, highlighting the involvement of communist leaders.  This strike stands as a landmark event in the history of Indian labor movements, showcasing the growing influence of communist ideology and the mobilization of a significant working-class population.  Statement 2 correctly points to Subhas Chandra Bose's role in resolving the Jamshedpur strike, demonstrating his engagement with labor issues beyond purely nationalist politics. This highlights his broader political vision encompassing socio-economic concerns.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the number of workers participating in strikes in 1928 was substantial, the figure of over five lakh (500,000) workers is provided in the source, not five million.  The exaggeration in statement 3 makes it a strong distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail and ability to differentiate between similar but inaccurate figures. The other options are incorrect because they include statement 3, which is factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and its evolution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The HRA was established in October 1924 following an All-India conference, aiming to organize an armed revolution.
2.  The Kakori conspiracy case (1925) resulted in the execution of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, among others, severely impacting the HRA.
3.  The HRA transformed into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928 under the leadership of Bhagat Singh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the founding of the HRA in October 1924, emphasizing its revolutionary goals and the organizational effort following an All-India conference. This reveals the strategic planning and coordination involved in the movement. Statement 2 accurately describes the consequences of the Kakori conspiracy case, including the execution of key figures like Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, which significantly weakened the HRA. This demonstrates the government's response to revolutionary activities.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the HRA did evolve into the HSRA, it was under the leadership of Chandra Shekhar Azad, not Bhagat Singh, in 1928.  The substitution of Azad with Bhagat Singh creates a plausible distractor, testing the candidate’s knowledge of key figures and their roles. The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly attribute the HSRA's formation to Bhagat Singh.


**3. With reference to the revolutionary activities of Bhagat Singh and his associates, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, assassinated a British police officer in retaliation for the lathi charge on a demonstration led by Lala Lajpat Rai.
2.  Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly on April 8, 1929, aiming to cause casualties and disrupt the government.
3.  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were executed on March 23, 1931, despite widespread public protests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly recounts the assassination of the British police officer as a response to the injuries sustained by Lala Lajpat Rai during a lathi charge. This illustrates the revolutionaries' methods and motivations. Statement 3 accurately details the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru despite public outcry, highlighting the government's response to revolutionary activism.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt did throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly, their aim was not to cause casualties but to make a political statement— "to make the deaf hear"— as a protest against the Public Safety Bill. The deliberate non-lethal nature of the bomb is a key detail, and its omission is a significant distractor. The other options are incorrect because they include statement 2, which misrepresents the intent behind the Central Legislative Assembly bombing.


**4. With reference to the activities of Surya Sen and the Chittagong armoury raid, consider the following statements:**

1.  Surya Sen led a raid on a government armoury in Chittagong in April 1930, marking a significant act of revolutionary terrorism in Bengal.
2.  The Chittagong armoury raid was characterized by a notable lack of participation by women revolutionaries.
3.  Surya Sen was arrested in February 1933 and subsequently executed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Surya Sen's leadership in the Chittagong armoury raid, highlighting its significance in the context of Bengal's revolutionary movement. This exemplifies the decentralized nature of revolutionary activities across India. Statement 3 correctly states Surya Sen's arrest and subsequent execution, demonstrating the government's crackdown on revolutionary groups. Statement 2 is incorrect. The source explicitly mentions the participation of young women in the terrorist movement in Bengal, contradicting the claim of a lack of female involvement in the Chittagong raid.  The inclusion of a factually incorrect statement about female participation acts as a significant distractor.  The other options are incorrect as they include statement 2, which is demonstrably false.


**5. With reference to the Simon Commission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Simon Commission, appointed in November 1927, consisted entirely of British members, leading to widespread protests across India.
2.  The Nehru Report, submitted in August 1928, proposed the attainment of Dominion Status as the next immediate step for India.
3.  The All-Party Convention held in Calcutta in December 1928 unanimously adopted the Nehru Report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the composition of the Simon Commission and the resulting Indian protests, highlighting the issue of self-determination. Statement 2 correctly identifies the Nehru Report's recommendation for Dominion Status.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The All-Party Convention failed to unanimously adopt the Nehru Report due to objections from communal leaders, highlighting the challenges of achieving national unity. This points to the complexities of Indian politics at the time.  The incorrect assertion regarding the unanimous adoption of the Nehru Report is a strong distractor. The other options are incorrect because they include statement 3, which is factually inaccurate.


**6. With reference to the Meerut Conspiracy Case, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case involved the arrest and trial of prominent trade union and communist leaders, including some British nationals.
2.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case trial concluded swiftly, lasting only a few months.
3.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case focused primarily on the activities of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the Meerut Conspiracy Case, involving the arrest of trade union and communist leaders, including British nationals. This highlights the government's suppression of leftist and labor movements.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The trial lasted for four years, showcasing the extensive legal processes involved in dealing with such cases.  The misrepresentation of the trial's duration is a significant distractor. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Meerut Conspiracy Case focused on trade union and communist activities, not specifically on the HSRA.  The incorrect association with the HSRA is another significant distractor. The other options are incorrect because they contain false information regarding the trial's duration and focus.


**7.  With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a police station was burnt, led to Mahatma Gandhi suspending the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  Subhas Bose, in his autobiography, expressed strong disapproval of Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Chauri Chaura incident and Gandhi's subsequent decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, highlighting his commitment to non-violence.  Statement 2 correctly reflects Subhas Bose's criticism of Gandhi's decision, revealing the internal differences within the nationalist movement.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The British Government did not grant India Dominion Status in response to the Non-Cooperation Movement; instead, it responded with repression.  The inclusion of a completely false statement about the British response acts as a very strong distractor. The other options are incorrect because they include statement 3, which is demonstrably false.


**8. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act established an All-India Federation incorporating both British India and the Princely States.
2.  The Act introduced universal adult suffrage in British India.
3.  The Act granted complete independence to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly notes the Act's provision for an All-India Federation, including both British India and Princely States, illustrating the complexities of the political structure.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did not introduce universal adult suffrage; instead, it provided a limited franchise.  The misrepresentation of the franchise is a significant distractor. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act did not grant complete independence but instead introduced a system of provincial autonomy with significant British control. The false claim of complete independence is another major distractor. The other options are incorrect because they include statements 2 and 3, which are factually inaccurate.


These MCQs aim to test not just factual recall but also analytical and evaluative skills, requiring candidates to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information within a complex historical context.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, thereby increasing the difficulty level and mimicking the style of UPSC examinations.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily focused on achieving immediate and complete independence from British rule.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his writings, highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, emphasizing the "drain of wealth."
3. The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while expanding the Legislative Councils, largely failed to satisfy nationalist demands for greater Indian representation and power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian National Congress (INC), from 1885-1905, is characterized by moderate nationalism.  The primary focus was on gradual constitutional reforms within the British Empire, not immediate and complete independence.  The early nationalists believed in working within the existing system to achieve a larger share in governance.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work on Indian poverty and economic drain is a cornerstone of early nationalist thought.  His analysis exposed the systematic exploitation of India's resources and wealth transfer to Britain, significantly impacting the nationalist movement's discourse.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Councils Act of 1892, while increasing the number of members in the Legislative Councils and introducing a limited form of indirect elections, fell far short of nationalist aspirations. The Act still maintained an official majority, limiting the real power of Indian representatives and fueling further demands for more substantial reforms.  The nationalists viewed the Act as inadequate and a mere "hoax."


**2. With reference to the early Indian nationalists' economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Early nationalists advocated for the complete dismantling of all existing Indian industries to pave way for modern industries.
2. The "Swadeshi" movement promoted the use of Indian goods and the boycott of British goods to stimulate indigenous industries.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji argued that British rule was gradually destroying India's economy, characterizing it as a continuous foreign invasion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Early nationalists did not advocate for the complete dismantling of existing Indian industries. Instead, they aimed to revitalize and modernize them alongside the development of new industries.  Their focus was on strengthening the Indian economy, not destroying its existing structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swadeshi movement was a crucial aspect of early nationalist economic policy. It involved actively promoting the use of domestically produced goods and boycotting British products as a form of economic resistance and a strategy to foster the growth of Indian industries.

Statement 3 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's analysis of British rule's impact on the Indian economy was influential.  He eloquently argued that British policies were systematically impoverishing India, viewing British rule as a continuous form of economic exploitation and drain of resources.


**3. With reference to the administrative reforms desired by early Indian nationalists, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early nationalists demanded the complete removal of all British personnel from the Indian administrative services.
2.  They advocated for the separation of judicial and executive powers to ensure fairness and impartiality in the administration of justice.
3. Gopal Krishna Gokhale highlighted the moral implications of the lack of Indian representation in higher administrative positions, emphasizing the "dwarfing" effect on the Indian race.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Early nationalists did not advocate for the complete removal of all British personnel from Indian administration. Their demand was for the "Indianization" of the higher echelons of the services—meaning increased Indian representation and participation, not complete exclusion of British officials.

Statement 2 is correct.  The separation of judicial and executive powers was a key demand of early nationalists. They argued that this separation was crucial for ensuring an independent and impartial judiciary, free from executive influence.

Statement 3 is correct. Gokhale's articulation of the moral dimensions of the lack of Indian representation in higher administrative services is significant. He powerfully argued that the exclusion of Indians from these positions had a detrimental effect on the self-respect and development of the Indian nation, creating a sense of inferiority and hindering the full potential of Indian talent.


**4. With reference to the growth of the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress was the first organized expression of Indian nationalism on an all-India scale, with no preceding organizations.
2.  A. O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a significant role in the founding of the Indian National Congress.
3.  The "safety valve" theory, suggesting the INC was created solely to prevent a violent uprising, fully explains the Congress's origins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indian National Congress was a crucial milestone in the development of Indian nationalism, it was not the first organized expression. Several provincial and regional organizations, like the Indian Association in Calcutta and the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, existed before the INC's formation, laying the groundwork for a national movement.

Statement 2 is correct. A. O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a key role in the INC's founding. He facilitated the initial meetings and helped bring together prominent Indian leaders to establish the organization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "safety valve" theory, while partially true, does not fully capture the complexities of the INC's origins. The Congress emerged from a confluence of factors, including the growing nationalist sentiment, the desire for a platform for political action, and the need for a unified voice to present Indian demands to the British government.  The "safety valve" aspect was one consideration among many.


**5.  With reference to the methods of political work employed by early moderate nationalists, consider the following statements:**

1.  Moderate nationalists primarily relied on violent uprisings and armed resistance to achieve their political goals.
2.  They engaged in constitutional agitation, working within the legal framework to present their demands to the authorities.
3.  They focused solely on domestic efforts, neglecting to engage in any form of international advocacy to promote India's case.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Moderate nationalists were staunchly committed to non-violent methods of political action. Their approach was characterized by constitutional means, such as petitions, public meetings, and participation in legislative councils, rather than violent uprisings.

Statement 2 is correct. Constitutional agitation was the cornerstone of the moderate nationalist approach. They believed in building public opinion, presenting their demands through legal channels, and working within the existing political system to gradually achieve their goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Moderate nationalists actively engaged in international advocacy to promote India's cause.  They sent deputations to Britain, established organizations in London (like the East India Association), and actively worked to influence British public opinion and parliamentarians.  This international dimension was a significant part of their strategy.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act successfully established a fully independent and sovereign Indian Union.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting greater power to elected provincial legislatures.
3. The federal component of the Act, aiming to unite British India and the princely states, was fully implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did *not* establish a fully independent and sovereign Indian Union.  It retained significant British control and power, particularly in areas like defence and foreign affairs.  The Act was a step towards greater Indian participation in governance but did not grant full independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced a system of provincial autonomy, granting considerably more power to elected provincial legislatures. While Governors retained significant powers, including the ability to veto legislation, this represented a significant shift towards greater self-governance at the provincial level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The federal component of the 1935 Act, which aimed to create an All-India Federation encompassing both British India and the princely states, was never fully implemented.  The princely states’ reluctance to join the federation ultimately prevented its complete realization.


**7. With reference to the Second Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dandi March, led by Gandhi, symbolized the Indian people’s defiance of British salt laws and their rejection of British rule.
2. The movement saw minimal participation from women and lower castes.
3. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the immediate granting of full independence to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dandi March was a pivotal event in the Second Civil Disobedience Movement.  Gandhi's act of making salt in defiance of British laws was a powerful symbol of resistance against British rule and resonated deeply with the Indian population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Second Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed significant participation from women, who played a crucial role in picketing, demonstrations, and other forms of civil resistance.  Lower castes also participated, though their involvement might have been less prominent in certain regions compared to other groups.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact did not lead to the immediate granting of full independence to India.  It resulted in the release of some political prisoners, the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement, and Congress participation in the Round Table Conferences.  However, it did not achieve the primary goal of immediate independence.


**8. With reference to the early nationalists' views on education, consider the following statements:**

1. Early nationalists universally supported the continuation of the existing English-medium education system without any changes.
2. They advocated for the expansion of primary education to reach the masses and improve literacy rates.
3.  They emphasized the importance of technical and higher education to foster national development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Early nationalists were not uniformly supportive of the existing English-medium education system.  Many advocated for greater emphasis on vernacular languages in education to make it more accessible and relevant to the Indian population. They saw the existing system as often denationalizing.

Statement 2 is correct. Early nationalists strongly advocated for the expansion of primary education to reach the wider masses.  They recognized the importance of basic literacy as a foundation for national progress and empowerment.

Statement 3 is correct.  Early nationalists emphasized the necessity of technical and higher education for national development.  They saw the advancement of these fields as crucial for modernizing the Indian economy and fostering scientific and technological progress.  This would be essential to compete in the global economy and reduce reliance on foreign expertise.


**9. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Home Rule Movement was solely led by moderate nationalists and rejected any form of aggressive political action.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant played significant roles in the movement's leadership.
3.  The movement was highly successful in achieving immediate self-government for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Home Rule Movement involved both moderate and extremist nationalists, with leaders like Tilak and Besant employing a more assertive approach than the purely constitutional methods of earlier moderate nationalists. While non-violent, it was a significant step towards more aggressive political mobilization.

Statement 2 is correct. Tilak and Besant were key leaders of the Home Rule Movement, establishing separate but coordinated leagues to mobilize support for self-government across different regions of India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Home Rule Movement did not achieve immediate self-government for India. Though it created significant momentum for the nationalist cause and influenced later developments, its primary goal of securing home rule remained unrealized at the time.  It did however create the groundwork for later mass movements.


**10. With reference to the nationalist response to the First World War, consider the following statements:**

1. All sections of Indian nationalists unanimously supported the British war effort without any reservations.
2.  Revolutionary groups sought to utilize the war as an opportunity to launch attacks against British rule.
3. The Moderates' support for the war effort was based on a belief that Britain would reciprocate with substantial political concessions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Indian nationalist response to the First World War was diverse. While some, particularly moderates, initially supported the war effort, others, including extremists and revolutionaries, had different stances and motivations.

Statement 2 is correct. Revolutionary groups saw the First World War as an opportune moment to weaken British power and launch attacks against the colonial government.  This involved activities both within India and through networks established abroad.

Statement 3 is correct.  A significant portion of the moderate nationalists' support for the war effort was based on the expectation that Britain would reward India's loyalty with greater political concessions, including movement towards self-government.  This hope was ultimately unfulfilled.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Indian freedom struggle.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the revolutionary movements in India during the 1920s and 1930s:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), primarily focused on assassinations of key British officials as its core strategy.
2. The Kakori Conspiracy case directly led to the formation of the HSRA, shifting the focus from armed robbery to purely socialist ideology.
3. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant example of revolutionary activity in Bengal, involving a large-scale armed assault on a government armory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the HSRA eventually broadened its goals to include socialist ideals, assassinations of British officials were a prominent tactic in its early years.  The assassination of John Saunders, mistaken for James Scott, exemplifies this.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kakori Conspiracy case, while a significant event for the HRA, did not directly lead to the HSRA's formation. The HSRA was formed later, partly in response to the Kakori setback and partly due to the increasing influence of socialist ideology among the revolutionaries. The shift was gradual, not an immediate consequence of the Kakori incident.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid was a bold and well-planned operation, showcasing the revolutionary movement's capacity for large-scale armed actions.  Its success, even if temporary, significantly impacted the morale of the revolutionaries and the public perception of their capabilities. The participation of women in the raid also highlights a unique aspect of the Bengal revolutionary movement.


**2. With reference to the ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for a socialist economic model for independent India, differing primarily in their approaches to achieving it.
2. Bose believed in a more centralized, potentially authoritarian system of governance initially, while Gandhi favoured decentralized village republics based on self-governance.
3. Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence was fundamentally opposed to Bose's belief in the necessity of armed struggle for achieving independence, reflecting their contrasting views on means and ends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While both leaders envisioned a socialist India, their approaches differed significantly. Gandhi's vision was rooted in village self-sufficiency and Sarvodaya, while Bose favored state-led industrialization and modernization.  Their disagreements stemmed from their interpretations of socialism and its implementation in the Indian context.

Statement 2 is correct. Bose, influenced by the efficiency and discipline of Fascist regimes, believed that a centralized, potentially authoritarian system might be necessary initially for rapid nation-building and economic development. Gandhi, on the other hand, envisioned a decentralized society with village republics as the foundation of self-governance, promoting individual and community responsibility over centralized state power.

Statement 3 is correct. The core difference between Gandhi and Bose lay in their approaches to achieving independence. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence and satyagraha stood in stark contrast to Bose's belief that armed struggle was necessary to overthrow British rule. This fundamental difference in their approach to the means of achieving independence highlights their divergent political philosophies.


**3. With reference to the impact of World War II on the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission, while offering a constituent assembly, failed to secure Indian support due to its offer of dominion status instead of complete independence and the provision allowing provinces to secede.
2. The Congress Working Committee's response to the outbreak of World War II was characterized by a unified stance, with complete agreement on the strategy of offering conditional support to the British war effort.
3. The August Offer, while making concessions such as a future constituent assembly, ultimately proved inadequate to bridge the gap between the nationalist demands and the British government's position.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cripps Mission's failure stemmed from several key factors.  The offer of dominion status, rather than complete independence, was a major point of contention. The provision granting provinces the right to secede, interpreted as a blueprint for partition, further undermined the Congress's support. The lack of immediate transfer of power and the retention of the Governor-General's supremacy also contributed to the mission's failure.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Congress Working Committee's response to the war was far from unified. There were significant differences of opinion between Gandhi, who favoured conditional support, the socialists who opposed any support, and Nehru, who advocated neither support nor taking advantage of Britain's difficulties. This internal debate highlights the complexities within the Congress during this critical period.


Statement 3 is correct. The August Offer, while promising dominion status and a future constituent assembly, failed to satisfy the Congress's demand for immediate self-governance. The conditions attached to the offer, including safeguards for minorities and the retention of British control over key areas, widened the gulf between the British government and the Indian nationalists, making the offer ultimately insufficient to achieve the Congress's objectives.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against the police, directly led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi, demonstrating his commitment to non-violence.
2. The Khilafat issue, although not directly related to Indian politics, provided a crucial platform for uniting Hindus and Muslims in a common struggle against British rule.
3. The movement witnessed widespread participation from diverse sections of Indian society, including peasants, students, and women, but the middle class showed limited enthusiasm for the movement's more radical aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence against the police, deeply disturbed Gandhi, who believed that non-violence was essential for the success of the movement.  He saw the incident as a clear violation of the principle of non-violence, leading to the suspension of the movement. This decision, although criticized by some, underscores Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violent methods.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, served as a powerful unifying factor, bringing together Hindus and Muslims in a shared struggle against British imperialism.  The shared concern for the fate of the Ottoman Caliph mobilized a broad base of support across religious lines.

Statement 3 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement attracted participation from diverse groups within Indian society.  While peasants enthusiastically participated, particularly in the Awadh Kisan movement, the middle class showed less support for the movement's more radical aspects, such as boycotting government institutions.  Students left educational institutions in large numbers, and women actively participated in picketing and boycotts.  This mixed response reveals the complexities of social mobilization during the movement.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, and the subsequent formation of Congress ministries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, granting provinces significant administrative and financial powers, but the Governor still retained considerable influence.
2. The Congress, while contesting elections under the Act, maintained its opposition to the Act itself, emphasizing that office acceptance was a strategic decision, not an endorsement of the Act's framework.
3. The formation of Congress ministries in several provinces after the 1937 elections marked a significant shift in the Congress's strategy, prioritizing administrative work over mass movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced a system of provincial autonomy, ending the earlier dyarchy system.  Provinces gained significant administrative and financial powers, but the Governor retained considerable authority, including special powers regarding minorities, law and order, and British interests.  This limited autonomy reflected the continued British control over crucial aspects of governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Congress's participation in the 1937 elections and subsequent formation of ministries in several provinces were strategic decisions.  While the Congress contested elections and formed ministries, it explicitly maintained its opposition to the 1935 Act itself.  Office acceptance was viewed as a tactical move to utilize the limited opportunities for constructive work and to further the nationalist cause from within the existing framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The formation of Congress ministries did not mark a complete shift from mass movements to administrative work. While the Congress utilized the opportunity to work within the existing structure, it continued to advocate for complete independence and did not abandon its commitment to mass movements as a means to achieve its political goals.  The period of Congress ministries was not a complete abandonment of mass mobilization but rather a strategic adaptation within a challenging political context.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the early 20th-century Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh followed riots in the Punjab's canal colonies in 1907.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's 1908 arrest resulted in a six-year prison sentence.
3.  Chidambaram Pillai's imprisonment occurred in Bombay, concurrent with the arrest of Krishna Kumar Mitra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907 following riots in the Punjab's canal colonies.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly mentions Tilak's arrest in 1908 and his subsequent six-year prison sentence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Chidambaram Pillai was indeed imprisoned, the text doesn't link his imprisonment to Bombay or mention a simultaneous arrest of Krishna Kumar Mitra in that location. Krishna Kumar Mitra's deportation is mentioned, but it's linked to Bengal and a different year (1908).  The distractor here plays on the fact that both individuals were imprisoned around the same time period, creating a plausible but incorrect connection.


**2. With reference to the militant nationalist movement in early 20th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurobindo Ghose advocated for "passive resistance" as the sole method of achieving independence.
2. The Swadeshi movement was primarily a means of achieving economic self-sufficiency, separate from political goals.
3.  Militant nationalists successfully organized a unified, nationwide movement reaching all segments of Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurobindo Ghose did advocate for passive resistance, the text makes it clear that this was *in addition* to Swadeshi and Boycott, indicating a multi-pronged approach, not a sole reliance on passive resistance.  The distractor uses a partial truth to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that militant nationalists used the Swadeshi and anti-partition agitation to arouse people politically and advocated for independence, directly linking economic and political goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage highlights the limitations of the militant nationalist movement, emphasizing their failure to create a sound organization or effectively reach the peasant masses. Their movement was largely confined to urban areas.  The distractor presents an overly optimistic view of the movement's success.  The question tests the examinee's ability to discern nuances in historical accounts.


**3. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chapekar brothers' assassination of British officials in 1897 marked the beginning of the revolutionary terrorist movement in Bengal.
2. V.D. Savarkar's Abhinava Bharat was a secret society that primarily focused on non-violent resistance.
3. The Yugantar and Sandhya newspapers actively promoted revolutionary terrorism in Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Chapekar brothers' actions took place in Poona (Pune), not Bengal, and while significant, it's not presented as the absolute *beginning* of the movement in the text. The question uses geographical and chronological manipulation to create doubt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Abhinava Bharat, organized by Savarkar, is described as a secret society of revolutionaries, directly contradicting the claim of non-violent focus.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly names the Sandhya and Yugantar as newspapers advocating revolutionary terrorism in Bengal.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress (INC) during the period 1905-1914, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1905 session of the INC, presided over by Dadabhai Naoroji, unequivocally declared the goal of "self-government" or Swaraj.
2. The Surat split in 1907 resulted from irreconcilable differences between moderate and militant nationalists within the INC.
3. The cancellation of the partition of Bengal in 1911 was solely due to the INC's sustained pressure and agitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji did advocate for Swaraj, the text indicates he was chosen as a *compromise* candidate in 1906, and the declaration of Swaraj as the goal happened in his presidential address.  Gokhale presided over the 1905 session. The question uses a subtle manipulation of dates and the role of Naoroji.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the Surat split in 1907 as a consequence of the conflict between moderate and militant factions within the INC.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the INC opposed the partition, the text suggests the cancellation in 1911 was a governmental decision, influenced by various factors, not solely due to INC pressure.  The question tests understanding of causality in historical events.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre directly contributed to the rise of the Khilafat movement.
2.  The Treaty of Sevres, signed in May 1920, significantly strengthened the position of the Ottoman Sultan and bolstered Muslim support for the British.
3. The Chauri Chaura incident led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly links the discontent stemming from the Rowlatt Act and Jallianwala Bagh massacre to the overall atmosphere that fueled the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Treaty of Sevres is described as *dismembering* Turkey and removing the Khalifa from power, directly contradicting the statement's claim. This is a clear distractor using opposite information.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident is explicitly cited as the reason for Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.


These questions aim to challenge the examinee's knowledge of specific details, their ability to analyze interconnected events, and their capacity to identify misleading information within plausible distractors.  They are designed to be difficult while remaining fair and relevant to the UPSC examination.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, primarily factual recall with elements of analysis and evaluation.  Plausible distractors are included to increase difficulty.


**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Andolan (1919-1922), consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat issue, though unrelated to Indian politics, strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity against British rule.
2. The Rowlatt Act, martial law in Punjab, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre fueled widespread Indian discontent.
3.  The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, aiming for dyarchy, fully satisfied the Indian demand for self-government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of Turkey after World War I, served as a powerful unifying factor between Hindus and Muslims in their opposition to British rule.  While not directly related to Indian domestic politics, it provided a shared cause for mobilization.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rowlatt Act, the imposition of martial law in Punjab, and the brutal Jallianwala Bagh massacre severely damaged the British government's credibility and fueled widespread resentment among Indians across various social strata. These events highlighted the oppressive nature of British rule and galvanized opposition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while introducing the concept of dyarchy (dual governance), failed to meet the rising Indian demand for substantial self-government.  The reforms were perceived as inadequate and insufficient to address the core issues of colonial rule.  The limited nature of the reforms actually contributed to further discontent and fueled the nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement's impact on various social groups, consider the following statements:**

1. The middle class initially led the movement but later showed reservations about Gandhi's programme, particularly in major urban centers.
2. The business class uniformly supported the economic boycott, fearing no labour unrest in their factories.
3.  Peasant participation was minimal, with the Congress successfully preventing any class-based conflicts within the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Non-Cooperation Movement saw significant initial participation from the middle class. However, as the movement progressed, reservations emerged, especially within the elite circles of major cities like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras.  The commitment to complete non-cooperation proved challenging for some, leading to a decline in participation from this segment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Indian business groups benefited from the emphasis on swadeshi (indigenous goods), support for the economic boycott was not unanimous.  Large businesses were apprehensive about potential labour unrest and the disruption it could cause to their operations.  Their support was therefore conditional and not uniformly enthusiastic.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Peasant participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement was substantial and, contrary to the statement, often involved conflicts between lower and upper castes and between peasants and landlords. The movement, despite Congress's intentions, provided a platform for expressing deeper grievances against existing social hierarchies and economic inequalities.


**3. With reference to the aftermath of the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajists, led by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, advocated entry into legislative councils to "end or mend" them from within.
2. The No-Changers, including C. Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Patel, completely rejected any form of engagement with the legislative councils and instead focused solely on constructive work.
3.  The Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party, formed by the Swarajists, immediately achieved a complete overhaul of the colonial legislative system through sustained obstructionist tactics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Swarajist position.  They proposed entering legislative councils not to cooperate with the colonial government but to utilize these platforms as arenas for political struggle, exposing the inadequacies of the system and mobilizing popular support. Their strategy involved both cooperation and obstruction depending on the circumstances.

Statement 2 is partially correct but overstates the No-Changer position. While the No-Changers prioritized constructive work and initially opposed council entry, their stance wasn't an absolute rejection.  They eventually reconciled with the Swarajists, allowing for participation in councils while maintaining their focus on constructive programs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swarajist strategy of obstruction within the councils, while effective in some instances, did not result in a complete overhaul of the colonial legislative system.  Their actions created some obstacles and exposed weaknesses but did not lead to the fundamental changes they aspired to.


**4. With reference to the emergence of new forces in the 1920s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was solely focused on individual acts of terrorism and rejected any engagement with mass movements.
2.  The Communist Party of India (CPI) was formed in 1920 in Moscow, and its activities remained entirely separate from the broader Indian nationalist movement.
3. The growth of trade unionism in India during the 1920s was largely unaffected by the broader political climate and remained focused on purely economic demands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HRA/HSRA, while initially engaging in individual acts of revolutionary violence, later evolved its strategy to incorporate mass mobilization and socialist ideals. Their activities were aimed at creating a wider revolutionary movement, not just isolated acts of terrorism.

Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. The CPI was not formed in Moscow but in Tashkent. More significantly, the CPI, despite its Marxist ideology, actively participated in and influenced the broader Indian nationalist movement, working alongside Congress and other groups to oppose colonial rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian trade union movement in the 1920s was deeply intertwined with the broader nationalist movement.  Many strikes and labor actions were explicitly linked to the anti-colonial struggle, reflecting the growing political consciousness among workers and their desire for self-determination.


**5. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement after the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose unequivocally supported the "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy advocated by Gandhi.
2.  The Government of India Act of 1935 was universally welcomed by all Indian political groups as a significant step towards self-governance.
3. The Congress, despite winning a majority in several provincial assemblies in the 1937 elections, initially hesitated to form ministries under the 1935 Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nehru and Bose, representing the leftist wing of the Congress, strongly criticized Gandhi's "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy, advocating for continuous confrontation with imperialism rather than intermittent periods of mass action followed by periods of reconciliation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 was met with widespread opposition from the Congress, which viewed the Act as inadequate and insufficient to address the core issue of Indian independence.  While some groups like the Hindu Mahasabha and the National Liberal Federation expressed willingness to work within the framework of the Act, it was not universally welcomed.

Statement 3 is correct.  Even after achieving majority in several provincial assemblies in the 1937 elections, the Congress initially debated whether to form ministries under the 1935 Act.  There were significant internal differences regarding the strategy of working within the colonial legislative system.  Ultimately, the Congress decided to form ministries in several provinces, but this decision was preceded by considerable deliberation and internal debate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and might vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.  The explanations aim to be comprehensive and incorporate UPSC-relevant perspectives.


**1. With reference to the early phases of Indian Nationalism (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The Ilbert Bill controversy highlighted the deep-seated racial prejudice within the British Indian administration.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's economic analysis exposed the "drain of wealth" from India to Britain.
3. The Indian Association, founded in Calcutta, primarily focused on advocating for land reforms in Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ilbert Bill, which sought to allow Indian judges to try European offenders, sparked intense opposition from the British community in India, revealing the prevalent racial discrimination. Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work meticulously documented the economic exploitation of India under British rule, a phenomenon he termed the "drain of wealth," significantly impacting Indian nationalist thought.  The Indian Association, however, while concerned with broader public interests, didn't primarily focus on land reforms; its agenda encompassed various aspects of administrative and political reform, including issues related to the civil services and the press.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement (1905), consider the following statements:**

1. Rabindranath Tagore composed the song "Bande Mataram" specifically for the Swadeshi Movement.
2. The movement saw significant participation from Bengali women, challenging traditional gender roles.
3.  The Swadeshi Movement resulted in the immediate establishment of numerous large-scale industries across India, significantly boosting industrial output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While "Bande Mataram" became a powerful anthem of the movement, it wasn't composed specifically for it; it predated the Swadeshi movement. The participation of women was a crucial and noteworthy aspect, challenging societal norms and marking a significant shift in their public role. However, the claim that the Swadeshi movement *immediately* resulted in the establishment of numerous large-scale industries is an overstatement. While it did provide a boost to Indian industries and saw the rise of several enterprises, the industrial growth was gradual and not an immediate consequence of the movement.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical reality.


**3.  With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was characterized by a unified, all-India organizational structure under a single leadership.
2.  The sale and circulation of pamphlets were not a significant feature of the Home Rule Movement's propaganda efforts.
3.  Boycott and picketing were prominent methods employed during the Home Rule Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Home Rule Movement, while aiming for a common goal, operated through two separate leagues, lacking a unified, all-India structure.  Pamphlets and other forms of printed propaganda were indeed crucial in disseminating the movement's message and mobilizing support. Boycott and picketing were also key methods employed to exert pressure on the British administration. Thus, only statement 3 is correct.  The fragmented nature of the movement and the importance of pamphlet distribution serve as significant distractors.


**4. With reference to the Champaran Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Champaran Satyagraha primarily focused on protesting against excessive taxation on sugar cultivation.
2. Mahatma Gandhi's involvement brought national attention to the grievances of Champaran cultivators.
3. The Champaran region lacked any prior history of anti-planter discontent before Gandhi's intervention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Champaran Satyagraha primarily addressed the oppressive conditions imposed by indigo planters, not excessive sugar taxes.  Gandhi's involvement significantly elevated the issue to a national level, garnering widespread attention and support.  Crucially, the Champaran region had a pre-existing history of anti-planter agitation and unrest, which provided the context for Gandhi's intervention.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The incorrect information about the crop (indigo instead of sugar) and the existence of prior unrest are designed to mislead.


**5. With reference to the early nationalists' demands, consider the following statements:**

1. Congress moderates consistently advocated for universal adult franchise as their primary political demand.
2.  They strongly opposed the curtailment of the powers of juries and advocated for greater representation of Indians in higher government positions.
3.  The early nationalists' agenda entirely neglected the plight of Indian workers who migrated to foreign countries in search of employment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Universal adult franchise wasn't a consistent demand of the Congress moderates in the early phase; their approach was more gradual and focused on incremental reforms.  They did, however, express concerns about the curtailment of jury powers and advocated for greater Indian participation in higher administrative positions.  Furthermore, early nationalists did not ignore the plight of Indian workers abroad; they actively voiced concerns about their conditions and the racial discrimination they faced, especially in South Africa, where Gandhi's work is a prime example.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the early nationalists' positions. The incorrect information about universal adult suffrage and the neglect of migrant workers serves as a strong distractor.



**6. With reference to the militant nationalists' approach (1905-1918), consider the following statements:**

1.  The militant nationalists successfully created a well-organized, nationwide structure to effectively guide their movement.
2.  Aurobindo Ghose advocated for a programme of passive resistance, including a boycott of government services and institutions.
3.  The militant nationalists' movement primarily focused on the urban lower and middle classes, with limited outreach to the peasantry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The militant nationalists, despite their radical ideas, lacked a cohesive, nationwide organizational structure; their efforts were more localized and lacked the centralized coordination needed for widespread impact. Aurobindo Ghose, a prominent figure, indeed advocated for passive resistance and boycotts as effective tools against British rule. Their movement did primarily focus on urban areas, with limited penetration into rural areas and among the peasantry.  Thus, statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The lack of a strong organizational structure is a crucial point that distinguishes the militant nationalists from later movements.


**7. With reference to the events surrounding the deportation of nationalist leaders, consider the following statements:**

1. Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1908 following riots in the canal colonies of Punjab.
2.  Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1907.
3. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was imprisoned for six years in 1908.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907, not 1908, following the Punjab riots. Krishna Kumar Mitra and Ashwini Kumar Dutt were indeed among the nine Bengal leaders deported in December 1908, not 1907. Tilak's six-year imprisonment did occur in 1908.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, with the incorrect years serving as effective distractors.  Precise chronology is crucial for accurate understanding.


**8. With reference to the growth of revolutionary terrorism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Yugantar newspaper actively advocated for revolutionary terrorism after the Barisal Conference of 1907.
2.  The Anushilan Samiti, a prominent terrorist organization, had only a few branches across Bengal.
3. V.D. Savarkar organized the Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of revolutionaries, after 1905.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Yugantar newspaper, indeed, advocated for revolutionary terrorism following the Barisal Conference of 1906, not 1907. The Anushilan Samiti had numerous branches, not just a few, making its network significant.  V.D. Savarkar did organize the Abhinava Bharat after 1905.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, with the incorrect number of branches and the year of the Barisal Conference acting as misleading elements.  The scale of the Anushilan Samiti and the precise timing of events are crucial for correct identification.


**9. With reference to the Indian National Congress (INC) in the period 1905-1914, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1905 session of the INC, under Gokhale's presidency, condemned the Partition of Bengal and supported the Swadeshi movement.
2. The Surat split of 1907 resulted in a lasting division within the INC, permanently weakening the organization.
3. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address at the 1906 INC session, explicitly declared the goal of the Indian national movement to be "self-government" or Swaraj.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gokhale's presidency in 1905 did see the INC condemn the Partition and support the Swadeshi movement.  The Surat split of 1907, while significant, didn't permanently cripple the INC; it eventually healed, although the impact was considerable. Dadabhai Naoroji's declaration of Swaraj as the goal of the movement happened at the 1906 session. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct. The long-term effects of the Surat split and the precise year of Naoroji's declaration are designed to create confusion.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Swarajist Party:**

1. The Swarajist Party was formed after the Gaya session of the Indian National Congress in December 1922, following disagreements over council entry.
2.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were key leaders of the Swarajist Party, with Das serving as president and Nehru as a secretary.
3. The Swarajists' primary objective was to gradually transform colonial rule through participation in legislative councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical context of the Swarajist Party's formation and leadership.  The party emerged directly from the divisions within the Congress over the strategy of participating in legislative councils. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were indeed central figures, leading the faction that favored council entry.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Swarajists aimed to "end or mend" the councils, their intention was not gradual transformation of colonial rule but rather to use the councils as a platform for political struggle and to expose the weaknesses of the colonial system. Their strategy was more confrontational than reformist.  They sought to obstruct the government's agenda from within the councils, not to cooperate in a gradual reform process.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched in 1920, primarily focusing on the boycott of British goods and institutions.
2.  The movement's initial success was largely due to widespread participation from peasants in Karnataka and significant non-Brahmin participation in Madras and Maharashtra.
3.  The Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, involving violence against police, led to the movement's suspension by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, involved a significant boycott of British goods and institutions as a form of non-violent resistance. Statement 3 is also accurate; the Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence, prompted Gandhi to suspend the movement due to his commitment to non-violence.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate in its specifics. While the Non-Cooperation Movement did witness significant peasant participation and involvement from various castes, the statement's assertion of widespread peasant participation from Karnataka and specific non-Brahmin participation in Madras and Maharashtra is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate in its geographic and social specificity. The movement's impact varied regionally and socially. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress was formed in Calcutta in December 1885 under the presidency of Motilal Nehru.
2.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a key role in the Congress's formation.
3.  The early Congress leadership primarily consisted of lawyers, journalists, and members of the landed gentry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies A.O. Hume's crucial role in the Congress's founding.  Statement 3 is also accurate; the early Congress leadership was predominantly composed of individuals from professional backgrounds, particularly lawyers and journalists, along with members of the landed gentry who held significant social and economic influence.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. While the Congress was indeed founded in December 1885, it was not in Calcutta but in Bombay, and the first president was Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, not Motilal Nehru. Motilal Nehru emerged as a prominent leader later. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.


**4. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Republican Association/Army (HRA) and Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori train robbery in 1925 was a significant event undertaken by the HRA.
2. Bhagat Singh was a key leader of the HSRA, which was formed after the Kakori incident.
3. The HSRA's activities primarily involved individual acts of assassination, such as the killing of John P. Saunders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Kakori train robbery was indeed a defining event for the HRA, showcasing their commitment to armed struggle. Statement 2 is also correct; Bhagat Singh was a crucial figure in the HSRA, which was formed after the HRA's reorganization in response to the setbacks following the Kakori incident.  However, statement 3 is an oversimplification. While the HSRA did engage in individual acts of assassination, such as the killing of John P. Saunders, their activities also included significant efforts to build a broader mass movement and to propagate their socialist ideology through public actions and propaganda.  Their actions were not solely focused on assassinations.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 provide a complete and accurate account.


**5. With reference to the post-Civil Disobedience Movement debates within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru strongly advocated for the continuation of mass civil disobedience, rejecting both constructive work and council entry as alternatives.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed council entry but later allowed Congressmen to participate in legislatures, provided they didn't compromise their principles.
3.  The Congress's decision to contest the 1937 provincial elections was a unanimous one, reflecting a consensus on the best path forward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects Nehru's position. He was critical of the alternatives to mass struggle and advocated for a more consistent anti-imperialist approach. Statement 2 is also accurate. Gandhi initially opposed council entry, viewing it as a potential distraction from the broader goal of independence, but later accepted it as a tactical manoeuvre for those who couldn't participate in direct action.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Congress's decision to contest the 1937 elections was not unanimous, reflecting significant internal divisions and debates over the strategy of office acceptance within the context of the 1935 Act.  The decision was reached after considerable discussion and disagreement, not as a unified consensus.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**6. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission proposed the immediate granting of complete independence to India upon the conclusion of World War II.
2. The mission offered a plan for a constituent assembly to frame India's constitution, with representation from both British Indian provinces and princely states.
3.  The Congress rejected the Cripps Mission's proposals primarily due to its offer of dominion status instead of complete independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the Cripps Mission's proposal for a constituent assembly. The plan included representation from both British Indian provinces and princely states to draft a new constitution.  Statement 3 is also correct. The Congress's primary objection to the Cripps proposals stemmed from the offer of dominion status, which fell short of their demand for complete independence.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did not propose immediate complete independence but rather dominion status after the war, with a constituent assembly to determine India's future status. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on achieving complete independence through immediate and direct confrontation with the British government.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji's "drain theory" highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
3. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 significantly expanded the powers of Indian legislative councils, granting them substantial control over the budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects Dadabhai Naoroji's contribution. His "drain theory" provided a powerful critique of the economic exploitation of India under British rule, a central theme of early nationalist discourse. However, statement 1 is incorrect.  The early nationalist movement, characterized by the "Moderates," did not advocate for immediate and direct confrontation but rather for gradual constitutional reforms within the existing British framework.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did increase the number of members in legislative councils and allowed for some indirect elections, but it did not grant Indian councils substantial control over the budget.  The budget remained largely under British control.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**8. With reference to the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilafat Movement was primarily a religious movement unrelated to Indian politics.
2. The movement aimed to protect the Ottoman Caliphate's control over Muslim holy places and territories.
3. Mahatma Gandhi's involvement helped forge a temporary alliance between Hindu and Muslim nationalists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes one of the Khilafat Movement's main goals.  The movement sought to protect the Ottoman Caliphate's authority and its control over Muslim holy sites and territories following World War I. Statement 3 is also correct.  Gandhi's participation in the Khilafat movement facilitated a significant, albeit temporary, alliance between Hindu and Muslim nationalists, uniting them in a common cause against British rule. However, statement 1 is inaccurate. While the Khilafat Movement had a strong religious dimension, it was deeply intertwined with Indian politics, providing a crucial platform for broader anti-British sentiment and collaboration between different religious communities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution was passed at the Bombay session of the Indian National Congress in 1942.
2.  The movement's call for immediate independence from British rule was met with widespread repression and mass arrests.
3.  The movement's success was largely due to the active participation of the Muslim League and other minority groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Quit India Resolution was indeed passed at the Bombay session of the Indian National Congress in 1942. Statement 2 is also accurate; the movement was met with swift and severe British repression, leading to mass arrests and widespread suppression of the movement. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement did not receive significant support from the Muslim League, which had its own political agenda, and participation from other minority groups was limited. The movement was predominantly led by the Congress and its supporters. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent federal government in India, granting complete control over all aspects of governance.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy.
3. The Act's provisions for separate electorates and reserved seats for various communities contributed to the growth of communal tensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the previous system of dyarchy.  Statement 3 is also accurate; the Act's provisions for separate electorates and reserved seats for different communities exacerbated communal tensions and contributed to the political divisions that ultimately led to the partition of India.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act did not establish a fully independent federal government.  Significant safeguards and special responsibilities were retained by the British, limiting Indian self-governance.  The proposed federation never fully materialized due to the non-participation of many princely states. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects of British India.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria, aiming for a difficult level of assessment.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding British administrative policies in India:**

1. The British adopted a policy of "Divide and Rule" primarily to prevent a unified Indian resistance against colonial rule, exploiting existing religious, caste, and regional differences.
2. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 aimed to curb the influence of the nationalist press by imposing restrictions on Indian-language newspapers, but this act was repealed within a short period due to widespread public outcry.
3. The British consistently supported social reform movements in India, aiming to modernize Indian society and culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British "Divide and Rule" policy is a well-documented aspect of their colonial strategy in India. By exacerbating existing social and religious divisions, they successfully weakened the potential for a unified nationalist movement capable of challenging their authority.  This is a crucial element in understanding the political dynamics of British India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 is a significant example of British attempts to control the flow of information and suppress dissent. While initially effective in silencing some voices, the strong public resistance and the act's subsequent repeal highlight the limitations of outright repression in the face of rising nationalism.  The relatively short lifespan of the act is a key detail often tested in UPSC exams.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  British policy towards social reform was inconsistent and often driven by pragmatic considerations rather than a consistent commitment to modernization. While they initially supported some reforms, particularly in the early 19th century, they later shifted their stance, often aligning themselves with conservative elements of Indian society to maintain their own power.  This shift in policy is a crucial point for understanding the complex relationship between British rule and social change in India.  The statement presents a misleadingly simplistic view of British policy.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in Southern India, involved direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars.  The tax rate under this system was fixed at 55% of the net produce.
2. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their land in exchange for a fixed revenue payment to the British. This system led to a significant increase in agricultural productivity and widespread prosperity among peasants.
3. The Mahalwari system, a compromise between the Ryotwari and Zamindari systems, involved revenue collection from village communities or groups of villages. It aimed to preserve traditional village structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Ryotwari system did involve direct revenue collection from cultivators, but the tax rate wasn't uniformly fixed at 55% of net produce; it varied across regions and over time.  The statement contains a misleadingly precise figure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement did grant zamindars proprietary rights, it did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or widespread peasant prosperity.  In fact, it led to many negative consequences including the exploitation of peasants and the rise of absentee landlordism. The statement presents an overly optimistic and inaccurate portrayal of the system's impact.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahalwari system did involve revenue collection from village communities or groups of villages as a collective unit.  While it aimed to maintain some aspects of traditional village structures, its implementation often fell short of this ideal.  This system's complexities are often overlooked in simpler summaries of British revenue policies, making it a good testing point for in-depth knowledge.


**3. With reference to British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in the social and religious affairs of India but later shifted towards a more interventionist approach, often supporting conservative social groups to maintain stability and control.
2.  The abolition of Sati was a major social reform undertaken by the British, widely welcomed by all sections of Indian society and implemented without significant resistance.
3. Christian missionaries actively supported both conservative and radical elements within the British administration in India, using their influence to advance their religious and social objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British approach to Indian social and religious matters evolved over time, shifting from a policy of non-interference to a more active role. This shift was often motivated by political expediency, and their alliances with conservative groups were strategic rather than based on a consistent ideological commitment to reform. This nuanced understanding of British policy is crucial for UPSC preparation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the abolition of Sati was indeed a significant social reform, it wasn't universally welcomed and faced considerable resistance from conservative segments of Indian society. The statement glosses over the complexities and controversies surrounding this reform.

Statement 3 is correct. Christian missionaries in India played a multifaceted role, engaging with both conservative and radical factions within the British administration. Their support for different groups was often determined by their strategic goals of furthering Christian influence and promoting Western ideals.  The statement accurately captures the missionary's opportunistic approach to furthering their agenda within the complex political landscape of British India.


**4. With reference to the impact of British land revenue systems on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The British land revenue systems consistently led to increased agricultural productivity and the prosperity of Indian farmers.
2. The introduction of private property rights in land, facilitated by the British systems, led to increased investment in land improvement and modernization of agricultural techniques.
3. The British land revenue systems resulted in widespread rural indebtedness and the displacement of many cultivators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British land revenue systems, while aiming to increase revenue for the British government, did not consistently lead to increased agricultural productivity or the prosperity of Indian farmers.  In fact, the high tax rates often imposed significant hardship on cultivators.  The statement presents a fundamentally flawed and simplistic view.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the introduction of private property rights in land was a significant change brought about by the British, it didn't automatically lead to increased investment in land improvement.  The high tax demands and the resulting indebtedness often prevented farmers from reinvesting their earnings.   The statement ignores the significant economic constraints faced by farmers.

Statement 3 is correct. The British land revenue systems are widely acknowledged to have contributed significantly to widespread rural indebtedness and the displacement of many cultivators. The high tax demands, coupled with the introduction of market forces and moneylending practices, led to the impoverishment of many rural communities. This is a critical element in understanding the long-term impact of British rule on Indian society and economy.


**5. With reference to British policies toward educated Indians, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently fostered the growth of modern education in India, recognizing its importance for societal progress and economic development.
2. The British initially viewed the emerging Indian middle class with suspicion, interpreting their nationalist aspirations as a challenge to colonial authority.
3. The British government's support for modern education in India was primarily aimed at creating a class of Indians who would serve the interests of the colonial administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British approach to modern education in India was complex and often contradictory. While they did introduce modern educational institutions, their support was often inconsistent and driven by pragmatic considerations, such as creating a class of Indians who could serve the colonial administration.  The statement ignores the underlying colonial motivations.

Statement 2 is correct. The British were initially wary of the growing Indian middle class, viewing their intellectual and political aspirations as a potential threat to their rule. This suspicion is reflected in various policies aimed at controlling or limiting the influence of educated Indians.  This is a key aspect of the British response to the rise of Indian nationalism.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the British did promote education in India, a significant part of their motivation was to create a class of Indians who would serve their administrative needs. This pragmatic approach shaped the nature and direction of education during the colonial era.  This statement accurately reflects the instrumental nature of British support for Indian education.
