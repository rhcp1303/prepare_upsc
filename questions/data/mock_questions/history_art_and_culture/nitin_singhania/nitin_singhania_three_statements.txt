**1. Consider the following statements regarding the coinage practices of different Indian dynasties:**

1.  The Satavahana dynasty predominantly used lead for their coinage, with silver coins being a rarity.
2.  The Western Satraps' coinage featured the king's head on one side and a Buddhist chaitya or stupa on the other, reflecting their interaction with the Satavahana tradition.
3.  The Gupta dynasty's gold coinage often depicted the emperor engaged in various activities, while the reverse side featured Goddess Lakshmi or other deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the coinage practices of the mentioned dynasties. The Satavahanas, known for their extensive use of lead in their coinage, rarely used silver. Their coins often featured symbols like elephants, horses, lions, or chaityas, along with the Ujjain symbol. The Western Satraps, successors to the Satavahanas in western India, continued some of these traditions, often depicting the king's head and a Buddhist chaitya on their coins.  The Gupta period, a time of significant artistic and economic prosperity, is marked by the widespread use of gold coinage. These coins frequently showcased the emperor engaged in activities such as religious ceremonies, hunting, or warfare, with the reverse side often displaying Goddess Lakshmi, other deities, or symbolic representations.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of all three statements.


**2. With reference to the art and architecture of the Mauryan Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mauryan palaces, notably those at Pataliputra, were primarily constructed using wood, as evidenced by historical accounts.
2.  Ashokan pillars, averaging 40 feet in height, were typically made of chunar sandstone and featured monolithic shafts with either lotus-shaped or bell-shaped capitals.
3.  The national emblem of India is derived from the abacus and animal figures of the Lauria Nandangarh pillar in Champaran.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of Mauryan architecture.  Megasthenes' accounts detail the extensive use of wood in the construction of Mauryan palaces at Pataliputra. These structures were renowned for their scale and grandeur. Ashokan pillars, a hallmark of Mauryan imperial power, were indeed typically crafted from chunar sandstone, reaching an average height of 40 feet. Their design consisted of a monolithic shaft topped with either a lotus-shaped or bell-shaped capital, often featuring animal figures on the abacus. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The national emblem of India is derived from the abacus and animal figures of the *Sarnath* pillar, not the Lauria Nandangarh pillar. The Sarnath pillar's abacus depicts four animals representing the four directions: a lion, a bull, a horse, and an elephant.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Romas, or Gypsies, migrated to Europe via Iran and Iraq, carrying with them aspects of Indian culture.
2.  Ashoka's efforts to spread Buddhism included sending his son and daughter to Sri Lanka.
3.  The Kalinga dynasty established trade relations with Southeast Asia, primarily for the exchange of spices and textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect historical accounts of cultural exchange.  The Romas, believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent, migrated westward, spreading aspects of their culture as they traveled through Iran, Iraq, and eventually to Europe. Ashoka's missionary activities played a crucial role in disseminating Buddhism to Sri Lanka, sending members of his royal family to establish the religion there. However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While the Kalinga dynasty engaged in maritime trade, their primary trade relations were with Sri Lanka, not Southeast Asia. The emphasis on Southeast Asia as a major trading partner for the Kalinga dynasty is a misrepresentation of historical evidence.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are supported by historical evidence.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Thanjavur school of painting:**

1. The Thanjavur school's major patronage came from the Vijayanagara Empire, which heavily influenced its artistic style.
2. The Thanjavur style is characterized by its use of gold coating in the paintings, and this technique has been awarded GI status by the Government of India.
3.  The Thanjavur school primarily depicted scenes from Hindu epics, particularly the Ramayana and Mahabharata, reflecting the religious beliefs of its patrons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While statement 1 is incorrect, statements 2 and 3 correctly describe aspects of the Thanjavur school of painting.  The major patronage of the Thanjavur school came primarily from the Maratha rulers, not the Vijayanagara Empire, although the earlier period might have influenced the later periods. The distinctive characteristic of Thanjavur paintings is the lavish use of gold, which is a significant element of the style. The Government of India has indeed granted GI status to the Thanjavur paintings based on this unique application of gold.  The paintings of the Thanjavur school often depict scenes from Hindu epics and religious narratives, reflecting the religious preferences of its patrons. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.



**5. With reference to Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The term 'Swara' in ancient Indian music referred to the recitation of the Vedas, and it later evolved to represent musical notes or scale degrees.
2.  A 'Raga' in Indian classical music is defined solely by its ascending (Aroha) and descending (Avaroha) melodic sequence of notes.
3.  The 'Tala' or rhythmic cycle in Indian classical music is entirely independent of the melody and possesses its own internal divisions and tempo.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect key concepts in Indian classical music. The term 'Swara' initially related to Vedic recitation but later came to denote the musical notes. The concept of 'Tala' as a rhythmic structure independent of melody is fundamental to Indian music.  However, statement 2 is an oversimplification. While Aroha and Avaroha are crucial, a raga's definition encompasses more than just these melodic sequences.  It includes specific notes, their emphasis (Vadi, Samvadi), the avoidance of certain notes (Vivadi), and the overall mood or Rasa it evokes.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 provide a complete and accurate representation of these musical elements.


**6. With reference to Sangam literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sangam literature is exclusively devoid of any reference to material culture or social classifications.
2.  The Tolkappiyam, a textbook on Tamil grammar, is considered part of Sangam literature and contains classifications of habitats, animals, plants, and human beings.
3.  Avvaiyar is a renowned female saint who contributed significantly to Sangam literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sangam literature does not extensively detail material culture in the way some other historical sources do, it does contain references to it.  Similarly,  social classifications are present, though perhaps not as systematically organized as in later texts. Statement 2 is correct. The Tolkappiyam is indeed a significant work of Sangam literature, providing insights into Tamil grammar and classifications of the natural and social world.  Statement 3 is also correct; Avvaiyar is a well-known female poet and saint whose work is considered part of the Sangam literary tradition. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to Indian folk theatre, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ankia Naat, a one-act play from Assam, was pioneered by Sankaradeva and his disciple Madhavdev and incorporates masks as a distinctive feature.
2.  Ramlila, a folk theatre form predominantly found in Uttar Pradesh, is an enactment of the Mahabharata and typically features only male actors.
3.  Raslila, a dance-drama popular in Gujarat and parts of North India, depicts the life and teachings of Lord Buddha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Ankia Naat, originating in Assam, was indeed developed by Sankaradeva and Madhavdev, and the use of masks is a key element of its performance style.  However, statement 2 is partially incorrect. Ramlila, popular in Uttar Pradesh, is an enactment of the *Ramayana*, not the Mahabharata. While it predominantly features male actors, the statement that *only* male actors participate is an oversimplification.  Statement 3 is completely incorrect. Raslila depicts the love story of Krishna and Radha, not the life of Lord Buddha.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the characteristics of the mentioned folk theatre forms.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Mughal coinage:**

1.  The Mughal standard gold coin was the Mohur, equivalent to nine rupees according to Abul Fazl's Ain-i-Akbari.
2. Akbar introduced Ilahi coins, valued at 10 rupees, to promote his new religious creed, Din-i-Illahi, and these coins featured inscriptions in Sanskrit.
3.  Jahangir's coinage often included couplets and sometimes bore the name of his wife, Nur Jahan, and depicted zodiac signs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately describe aspects of Mughal coinage. The Mohur was indeed the standard gold coin, with its value as stated by Abul Fazl. Jahangir's coins frequently incorporated couplets, sometimes included Nur Jahan's name, and featured zodiac signs.  However, statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Akbar did introduce Ilahi coins valued at 10 rupees to promote his Din-i-Illahi, the inscriptions on these coins were primarily in Persian, not Sanskrit. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully correct.


**9. With reference to the development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Ravi Varma, known as the father of modern Indian art, is associated with the Bengal School of Art.
2. M.F. Hussain, a renowned Indian painter, is known for his painting "Ravana Kidnapping Sita & Killing Jatayu".

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Raja Ravi Varma is considered a pioneer of modern Indian art but is not directly associated with the Bengal School of Art.  Statement 2 is correct; M.F. Hussain is indeed famous for his painting "Ravana Kidnapping Sita & Killing Jatayu".  Statement 3 is also correct; Abanindranath Tagore was a key figure in the Bengal School, and Rabindranath Tagore, though primarily known for his literature, was also involved in the art movement.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to different regional painting styles in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pattachitra is a traditional painting style associated with Karnataka, known for its intricate details and vibrant colors.
2.  Paitkar painting is a folk art form primarily found in Jharkhand, often depicting mythological and religious themes.
3.  Manjusha painting, characterized by its use of natural pigments and earthy tones, is a traditional art form of Odisha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Paitkar painting is indeed a folk art form of Jharkhand, often depicting mythological and religious narratives. Statement 1 is incorrect; Pattachitra is associated with Odisha, not Karnataka.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; Manjusha painting is a style associated with Bihar, not Odisha. The descriptions given in the statements are deliberately misleading to test the examinee's knowledge of the correct geographical locations. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately identifies the painting style and its region of origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The statement 1 is correct. Kanganahalli in Karnataka contains a stone sculpture of Ashoka with the inscription "Ranyo Ashoka" in Brahmi script.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while Sanchi is a significant Buddhist site with a famous stupa, it's not associated with Ashokan Kharosthi inscriptions.  Those are found at Shahbazgarhi. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The Shahbazgarhi edicts are in Kharosthi script, not Brahmi, and while a massive stupa exists there, the description of a stone sculpture of Ashoka with a Brahmi inscription is inaccurate. The Brahmi inscription and Ashoka sculpture are found at Kanganahalli. The other options incorrectly attribute features to the wrong sites, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of specific archaeological findings associated with each location.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara empire is noted for its grand temples, many featuring Kalyana Mandapas as significant architectural elements. Statement 2 is correct; Chalukya temples are indeed known for their sophisticated carvings but not for Kalyana Mandapas. Statement 3 is also correct; Chandela architecture is distinctly Nagara style and doesn't feature Kalyana Mandapas. This question tests the knowledge of specific architectural styles and features associated with different dynasties in South India. Option (c) accurately identifies all the correct statements, demonstrating a clear understanding of the subject.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Historical research places Saint Nimbarka's life several centuries before Akbar's reign. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Saint Kabir predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, making any significant influence highly improbable. Statement 3, while generally true regarding Kabir's syncretic approach, is inaccurate for Nimbarka, whose teachings were firmly within the Vaishnava tradition. This question tests knowledge of the chronology and influences of prominent Bhakti movement saints.

(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar patronized illustrated manuscripts extensively, the shift towards album and individual portraits was more prominent during Jahangir's reign. Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir's personal interest in painting and his patronage led to the flourishing of individual portraits characterized by realism and attention to detail. Statement 3 is correct. Shah Jahan's reign is most remembered for its architectural achievements, including the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid.  The other options incorrectly associate these artistic shifts with the wrong Mughal emperors, demonstrating the importance of understanding the stylistic evolution of Mughal art under each emperor’s distinct patronage.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverged from earlier Buddhist schools by emphasizing the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine being worthy of worship.  This is a key distinction. The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is also central to Mahayana thought.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this core belief.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Mahayana Buddhism, unlike Theravada, did see a rise in image worship and elaborate rituals as part of its devotional practices.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about the impact of Babur's arrival in India:**

1. Babur's invasion marked the first introduction of gunpowder warfare to the Indian subcontinent.
2. The architectural style incorporating arches and domes was entirely introduced by Babur's Timurid dynasty.
3. Babur's conquest directly led to the establishment of the Mughal dynasty in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's army effectively utilized gunpowder weaponry, its use in India predates his arrival.  Gunpowder technology had already diffused into India through various routes and was used in warfare by several preceding powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Arch and dome architectural features were present in India long before Babur's arrival.  The Delhi Sultanate, for instance, extensively used these elements in its constructions.  Babur's Timurid architectural style, while influential, didn't represent a completely novel introduction to India.  It blended existing indigenous styles with Central Asian influences.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect.  Babur's victory at Panipat laid the foundation for the Mughal Empire, but the term "Mughal dynasty" more accurately represents the consolidation of power under his successors, particularly Akbar.  The immediate outcome of his arrival was the establishment of a new Timurid power base, which evolved into the Mughal Empire over time. Therefore, the most accurate answer is (d), as statements 2 and 3, while needing careful nuance, are closer to the truth than the other options.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar (constructed primarily between the 11th and 13th centuries CE).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves (Gupta period, 5th century CE) postdates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram (Pallava period, 7th-9th centuries CE).  The Pallava dynasty's rock-cut work came earlier.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ajanta Caves (2nd century BCE – 650 CE) experienced construction over a long period but some of the cave construction occurred earlier than the construction of the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram (8th century CE).  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While gunpowder existed in India before Babur, his campaigns and the subsequent Mughal rule significantly popularized and advanced its use in warfare across the subcontinent.  The statement accurately reflects the impact of his arrival on military technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect.

This statement correctly reflects the chronological order of these artistic creations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar belongs to a much later period (Kalinga architecture, 11th-13th century CE), making it younger than the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli.  It is also significantly later than the Mahabalipuram monuments. The statement incorrectly places the temple within an earlier timeframe.

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mughal history and culture.  Tansen, a renowned musician, was indeed granted the title "Mian" by Emperor Akbar, highlighting the emperor's patronage of the arts and his appreciation for musical talent.  Jahangir's reign marked a distinct shift in Mughal artistic preferences, moving away from the large-scale illustrated manuscripts prevalent under Akbar towards a greater focus on individual portraits, especially those featuring flora and fauna, and the compilation of album collections. This shift reflects both Jahangir's personal interest in painting and a broader evolution in artistic styles within the Mughal court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each statement accurately describes a specific characteristic of a different Ashokan inscription. The Kalsi inscription in Uttarakhand is indeed unique among Ashokan inscriptions found in North India for containing a complete set of the fourteen major rock edicts. This underscores the significance of the site in disseminating Ashoka's edicts throughout his empire.  The Maski inscription in Karnataka holds the distinction of being the first to explicitly mention Ashoka by name, rather than using his customary titles. This inscription's use of Ashoka's personal name marks a shift in the way his authority was represented and provides valuable historical information. Lastly, the Kalinga edicts, located in Odisha, are specifically noteworthy for their focus on peace and reconciliation following the Kalinga War. Their emphasis on non-violence and the welfare of the conquered population reflects Ashoka's change in policy after the war and his adoption of a more compassionate approach to governance.

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the historical significance of these ancient Indian ports. Lothal, an Indus Valley Civilization site in Gujarat, is renowned for its meticulously constructed dockyard, which provides compelling evidence of the Harappans' advanced maritime capabilities and their involvement in extensive trade networks. The presence of a sophisticated dockyard at Lothal demonstrates a level of engineering and urban planning that was highly advanced for its time. Muziris, situated on the Malabar Coast in present-day Kerala, played a crucial role as a major trading hub during the early centuries CE. It facilitated the exchange of spices and other valuable commodities between India and the Roman Empire, as well as other regions in the West and East, underscoring its strategic importance in the ancient Indian Ocean trade network. Tamralipti, located in modern-day West Bengal, functioned as a vital port city during the Mauryan period and beyond. Its strategic location facilitated trade with Southeast Asia and other regions across the Indian Ocean, highlighting its role in the expansion of Mauryan influence and the spread of Indian culture and goods to distant lands.  The port's prominence is supported by historical accounts from both Indian and foreign sources.

All three statements correctly identify key characteristics of the major styles of Indian temple architecture.  The Nagara style, dominant in northern and central India, is indeed defined by its distinctive shikharas, which are curvilinear towers that rise above the sanctum sanctorum, creating a visually striking and symbolic representation of the mountain abode of the gods. The Dravidian style, prevalent in South India, is characterized by its impressive gopurams, which are monumental gateways that serve as entrances to temple complexes. These towering structures are often elaborately decorated with sculptures and intricate carvings, symbolizing the gateway to the sacred space. Finally, the Vesara style represents a hybrid architectural tradition, combining elements from both the Nagara and Dravidian styles. This fusion is particularly evident in the temple architecture of Karnataka and other transitional regions, where the influence of both northern and southern traditions can be seen in the design and construction of temples.

Its sophisticated craftsmanship and use of advanced techniques highlight the level of artistic skill during the era. Yakshas and Yakshis, nature spirits or deities, were indeed venerated across different religious traditions during the Mauryan period, including Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Their presence in art and religious practices reflects the syncretic nature of religious beliefs and practices during the time. Finally, the Barabar and Nagarjuni caves in Bihar, known for their remarkable rock-cut architecture, were indeed initially utilized by the Ajivika sect, a distinct religious group in ancient India.  Later, these caves were also adopted by Buddhist and Jain monks, demonstrating the adaptability of these cave structures to various religious communities.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the diverse ways in which Indian culture spread to other parts of the world. The Roma people, also known as Gypsies, are believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and migrated westward, carrying their distinctive cultural traditions and practices with them. Their dispersal across Europe and West Asia contributed to the dissemination of certain aspects of Indian culture in those regions. Indian traders engaged extensively in maritime trade across the Indian Ocean, establishing connections with various parts of Southeast Asia from early centuries CE onwards. This interaction facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices, leading to the spread of Indian cultural influences in Southeast Asia.  The establishment of Buddhist monasteries in Southeast Asia played a significant role in disseminating Buddhist philosophy, practices, and art forms. These monasteries became centers of learning and religious practice, influencing the religious and cultural landscape of the regions where they were established.

All three statements accurately reflect the contributions of these significant foreign travelers to our understanding of ancient and medieval India. Megasthenes' Indica, though fragmented, offers invaluable insights into the Mauryan Empire's administration, social structures, and daily life. His observations, while filtered through a Greek lens, remain a crucial source for understanding the Mauryan period. Fa-Hien's Record of Buddhist Kingdoms provides a firsthand account of India during the Gupta period, focusing primarily on Buddhist sites and practices, but also offering valuable insights into the religious and social landscape of the time. His account is particularly important for understanding the flourishing of Buddhism during the Gupta era. Al-Biruni's Kitab-ul-Hind is a monumental work that delves into numerous aspects of Indian society, including religion, science, and customs.  While his account is undeniably shaped by his own cultural background, his keen observations and attempts at cross-cultural understanding make his work an indispensable resource for scholars.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Seven Cities of Delhi:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While statement 1 is partially true in that Qila Rai Pithora is considered the earliest recorded city of Delhi, it's crucial to note that Prithviraj Chauhan expanded an existing structure rather than establishing a completely new city from scratch.  The core of the structure was likely built by Tomar Rajputs. Therefore, attributing the city's founding solely to Prithviraj Chauhan is an oversimplification. Statement 2 is entirely correct. The Seljuk architectural style is prominently displayed in Siri, built by Alauddin Khilji. The presence of Seljuk craftsmen in Delhi, fleeing the Mongol invasions, significantly influenced the architectural style of this period. Statement 3 is also accurate. Jahanpanah, constructed by Muhammad bin Tughlaq, was strategically situated between the earlier cities of Qila Rai Pithora and Siri, reflecting a deliberate urban planning strategy aimed at consolidating and expanding the city's boundaries.  The strategic location of Jahanpanah, between two earlier cities, demonstrates a deliberate urban planning strategy.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Kalidasa's literary achievements.  His plays, including *Abhijnanashakuntalam*, *Vikramorvashiyam*, and *Malavikagnimitram*, are indeed renowned and established his literary fame.  *Raghuvamsa* and *Kumarasambhava* are celebrated epic poems, and *Ritusamhara* (Seasons) and *Meghaduta* (Cloud Messenger) are also significant works showcasing his mastery of Sanskrit poetry. Statement 3, however, is a misrepresentation. While Kalidasa's works often feature romantic elements, they are not solely confined to courtly love and romantic relationships.  His works also explore broader themes such as dharma, nature, and human emotions, often interwoven with social and political contexts of his era.  For instance, *Abhijnanashakuntalam* subtly touches upon the intricacies of royal court life and societal norms. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are historically accurate. Shashanka's reign in the Gauda kingdom is generally placed in the 7th century CE (600-625 CE, approximately), making him the first known king of ancient Bengal.  His contemporaneity with Harshavardhana and Bhaskaravarman is well-established, and his rule is supported by evidence from inscriptions and other historical sources.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  Shashanka is known for his strong Hindu leanings and his persecution of Buddhism. Historical accounts suggest he destroyed Buddhist stupas in Bengal and even damaged the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, actions that contradict the notion of religious tolerance.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Harshavardhana's rule. His empire did indeed cover a significant portion of North India, and his administration, though characterized by a feudal system, was effective in maintaining control over this vast territory.  Historical accounts indicate his religious evolution, starting with Shaivism and Sun worship and later embracing Mahayana Buddhism, significantly influencing his policies.  The detailed account of Harsha's reign and Kannauj provided by Xuanzang in his writings is a crucial primary source for understanding this period.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.



**4. With reference to Dharma Pala's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dharma Pala, the second Pala ruler of Bengal, is credited with reviving Nalanda University and establishing Vikramshila University.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of Dharma Pala's legacy. He is widely recognized for his significant role in the revival of Nalanda University and the founding of Vikramshila University, both major centers of Buddhist learning. The exact dates of his reign are subject to some scholarly debate, but the consensus places it within the 8th and 9th centuries CE.  Statement 3 is inaccurate. Dharma Pala's patronage extended beyond Nalanda. He is credited with establishing numerous other religious institutions and supporting Buddhist scholars and authors, indicating a broader impact on the religious landscape of the time.  Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict Gorakhnath's position within Nath Yoga and his philosophical contributions. He was indeed a significant disciple of Matsyendranath and a key figure in the Nath Sampradaya, strongly associated with Shaivism.  His teachings focused on spiritual self-realization and ethical conduct, earning him the title of Maha Yogi.  Statement 3, however, is a misrepresentation. While Gorakhnath's followers did maintain monasteries (like the Gorakhnath Math), they also participated in a warrior ascetic movement, particularly from the 14th century onwards, resisting oppression from both Islamic and British rule. This military and political involvement contradicts the statement's claim of a solely peaceful existence.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**6. With reference to Amir Khusrau's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a Sufi musician, poet, and scholar, was a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly highlight Amir Khusrau's multifaceted achievements. He was a prominent disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya, a renowned Sufi saint, and his association with the Sufi tradition deeply influenced his artistic and intellectual pursuits.  His contributions to the ghazal form and his role in the development of Qawwali are undeniable, securing his place in South Asian musical history. Statement 3, however, is inaccurate. While Khusrau's work reflects his Sufi beliefs, it also encompasses a wide range of themes, including secular and romantic ones.  His famous narratives like the *Laila Majnu* story demonstrate his engagement with diverse literary subjects. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. With reference to Marco Polo's travels, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are supported by historical evidence. Marco Polo's travels did indeed take him to the Pandyan kingdom in South India during the period mentioned. His account includes descriptions of the king's wealth and the importation of horses, reflecting his observations during his extensive travels. Statement 3, however, is a problematic oversimplification. While Polo's account provides valuable insights, modern historians acknowledge the limitations and potential biases in his narrative.  His descriptions are sometimes exaggerated or interpreted through the lens of his own cultural background. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Rudrama Devi's rule is indeed placed in the 13th century CE, making her a significant example of a female monarch in Indian history. She is known for her military skills and effective administration, successfully navigating challenges associated with being a female ruler. However, statement 3 is an overstatement. While Rudrama Devi maintained the integrity of the Kakatiya empire, there was no major territorial expansion during her reign. She faced numerous internal and external challenges but focused on preserving the existing empire, not expanding it significantly. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**9. With reference to Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule was characterized by ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful economic and administrative reforms.
2.  He is known for his harsh treatment of enemies, but also for his knowledge of poetry, astronomy, religion, and philosophy.
3.  The introduction of token currency during his reign was a resounding success, significantly improving the economy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key aspects of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign. His economic and administrative reforms, such as the relocation of the capital to Daulatabad and the introduction of token currency, were indeed ambitious but ultimately failed due to poor planning and execution.  His reputation for harsh treatment of opponents is also well-documented.  His intellectual pursuits in poetry, astronomy, religion, and philosophy are also acknowledged.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the token currency experiment was a major failure, leading to economic instability and widespread discontent. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**10. With reference to Narsinh Mehta's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Narsinh Mehta, a Gujarati saint poet (15th century), is known for his expertise in Vaishnava poetry and is titled "Adi Kavi."
2.  His bhajan "Vaishnav Jana To" is widely known and was a favorite of Mahatma Gandhi.
3.  Narsinh Mehta's literary works are exclusively devotional hymns dedicated to Lord Krishna, with no other significant themes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of Narsinh Mehta's contributions to Gujarati literature and his lasting legacy. He was a prominent Vaishnava poet of the 15th century, and the title "Adi Kavi" (first poet) is associated with him. His bhajan "Vaishnav Jana To" is indeed famous and held in high regard, particularly for its adoption by Mahatma Gandhi.  However, statement 3 is an oversimplification. While Narsinh Mehta's work is rich in devotional poetry for Krishna, his literary output also includes other forms like "Pada Verse," "Aakhyan," and "Prabhatiya," indicating a broader thematic range than solely devotional hymns. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully accurate.


**11. With reference to Mahmud Begada's rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Begada, the Sultan of Gujarat (15th-16th century), ruled for over fifty years and is known for his administrative skills.
2.  Ahmedabad and Champaner served as his capitals, and his reign witnessed the flourishing of Gujarat's economy and culture.
3.  Mahmud Begada's rule was characterized by religious intolerance and persecution of non-Muslim communities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Mahmud Begada's reign.  He ruled Gujarat for more than fifty years and is known for his effective administration, which contributed to the prosperity of the region. Ahmedabad and Champaner were indeed his capitals. His rule saw a flourishing of Gujarat's economy and culture.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While historical accounts may reveal instances of conflict or differing policies towards various communities,  Mahmud Begada's rule is not characterized by widespread religious intolerance or systematic persecution of non-Muslim communities in the same way as some other rulers might be.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**12. With reference to Eknath's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Eknath, a Marathi saint, scholar, and religious poet, was associated with the Varkari Sampradaya.
2.  He was influenced by Sufi mysticism and Vedanta philosophy, reflected in his unique literary style and spiritual teachings.
3.  Eknath's major work, *Eknath Bhagavata*, is a Marathi commentary on the entire Bhagavata Purana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Eknath's background and influences. He was a prominent figure in the Varkari Sampradaya, a significant devotional movement in Maharashtra, and his writings exhibit a blend of Varkari traditions, Sufi mysticism, and Vedantic philosophy.  Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While *Eknath Bhagavata* is indeed a major work, it is a commentary on the 11th Skanda (book) of the Bhagavata Purana, not the entire text.  This detail makes statement 3 inaccurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely correct.


**13. With reference to Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar, the third Mughal emperor, is known for his policy of religious tolerance and his promotion of secularism.
2.  He introduced "Din-i-Illahi," a syncretic religious path aimed at fostering unity and tolerance within his empire.
3.  Akbar's religious policies led to widespread religious harmony, eliminating all forms of religious conflict during his reign.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Akbar's reign is indeed associated with a policy of religious tolerance and his attempts to create a secular environment within his empire.  The introduction of "Din-i-Illahi" is a well-known aspect of his religious policy, though its impact and success are debated by historians.  However, statement 3 is an oversimplification. While Akbar's policies aimed at religious harmony, religious conflicts and tensions did not entirely disappear during his reign.  Various religious groups still held differing views and occasionally clashed, despite Akbar's efforts.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**14. With reference to Sankardev's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sankardev, a Vaishnava saint-scholar from Assam (15th-16th century), propagated the philosophy of "Ekasarana Dharma."
2.  He is known for his literary works, including *Kirtan Ghosa*, written in Brajawali, a mixture of Maithili and Assamese.
3.  Sankardev's teachings significantly influenced the development of the ISKCON movement in the 20th century.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe Sankardev's life and work. He was a significant Vaishnava figure in Assam, known for his propagation of "Ekasarana Dharma," a monotheistic Vaishnava philosophy centered on Krishna. *Kirtan Ghosa*, written in Brajawali, is a notable example of his literary contributions.  However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While Sankardev's teachings are significant within the broader Vaishnava tradition,  ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) draws its primary inspiration from Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings, not directly from Sankardev's philosophy, although there are shared elements within Vaishnavism.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**15. With reference to Surdas's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Surdas, a blind devotee of Lord Krishna (16th century), belonged to the Saguna school of Vaishnava bhakti.
2.  He was a disciple of Vallabhacharya and is known for his famous composition, *Sursagar*.
3.  Surdas's literary works are primarily in Sanskrit, reflecting the classical tradition of Hindu religious literature.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Surdas's background and literary achievements. He was a prominent devotee of Krishna, belonging to the Saguna school of Vaishnava bhakti, emphasizing the personal attributes of God. His association with Vallabhacharya and his authorship of *Sursagar*, a significant collection of devotional poetry, are well-documented. Statement 3 is inaccurate.  While Surdas's work is rooted in the devotional tradition, his compositions are primarily in Braj Bhasha, a vernacular language, not Sanskrit. His use of Braj Bhasha made his work accessible to a wider audience, unlike the more classical Sanskrit. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**16. With reference to Meerabai's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Meerabai, a royal devotee of Lord Krishna (16th century), is known for her passionate bhajans.
2.  She is celebrated for her poetic expression of intense devotion, often using the metaphor of Krishna as her husband.
3.  Meerabai's bhajans are primarily in Sanskrit, maintaining the traditional style of Hindu devotional poetry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately represent Meerabai's significance in the Bhakti movement. She was a royal devotee whose intensely emotional bhajans expressing her love for Krishna are still widely sung.  The metaphorical portrayal of Krishna as her husband is a hallmark of her poetic style. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Meerabai's bhajans were composed primarily in Rajasthani, a vernacular language, not Sanskrit. This choice of language made her work accessible to a wider audience beyond the learned elite. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**17. With reference to Dadu Dayal's teachings, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadu Dayal (16th-17th century), a religious reformer from Gujarat, rejected the authority of the Vedas and the caste system.
2.  He emphasized japa (repetition of God's name) as a central practice, and his followers are known as Dadupanthis.
3.  Dadu Dayal's teachings were strongly influenced by Sufi mysticism, incorporating many Sufi practices into his spiritual path.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Dadu Dayal was a prominent religious reformer who rejected the authority of the Vedas and the rigidity of the caste system, promoting a more egalitarian approach to spirituality.  His emphasis on japa (the repetition of God's name) is a core element of his teachings, and his followers are known as Dadupanthis. Statement 3 is an oversimplification. While Dadu Dayal's teachings share some similarities with Sufi thought in their emphasis on direct experience of the divine and rejection of ritualistic practices,  it's inaccurate to say they were strongly influenced by Sufi mysticism and incorporated many Sufi practices.  His path was unique and distinct, drawing from various sources but not primarily Sufi. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**18. With reference to Dnyaneshwar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dnyaneshwar (13th century), a Varkari saint from Maharashtra, authored *Dnyaneshwari*, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.
2.  His works are considered among the earliest surviving works in Marathi literature.
3.  Dnyaneshwar's teachings were primarily focused on jnana yoga (path of knowledge), neglecting bhakti yoga (path of devotion).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Dnyaneshwar was a significant figure in the Varkari tradition and is renowned for his *Dnyaneshwari*, a highly influential commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, written in Marathi. His works represent some of the earliest surviving examples of Marathi literature. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Dnyaneshwar's work does delve into philosophical aspects of jnana yoga, his teachings also strongly emphasize bhakti yoga, the path of devotion to God, which is a core element of the Varkari tradition.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**19. With reference to Namdev's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Namdev (14th century), a Varkari saint from Maharashtra, was a devotee of Vithoba.
2.  His writings are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy text of Sikhism.
3.  Namdev's literary works primarily focused on philosophical debates, with limited attention to devotional poetry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Namdev was a significant Varkari saint who worshipped Vithoba, a form of Vishnu.  His devotional poetry is included in the Guru Granth Sahib, highlighting his influence across religious traditions. Statement 3 is incorrect. Namdev is primarily known for his powerful devotional poetry, not primarily for philosophical debates. His verses express deep love and devotion to God, a central theme in the Varkari tradition. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**20. With reference to Eknath's religious influences, consider the following statements:**

1.  Eknath (16th century), a Varkari saint, was influenced by both Sufi mysticism and Vedanta philosophy.
2.  His major work, *Eknathi Bhagavata*, is a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.
3.  Eknath's teachings emphasized kirtana (singing God's names), nama smarana (remembrance of God's name), and dhyana (meditation).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Eknath's work shows a clear influence of both Sufi mysticism and Vedanta philosophy, reflecting a syncretic approach to spirituality.  His emphasis on kirtana, nama smarana, and dhyana as paths to spiritual growth are core elements of his teachings. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While *Eknathi Bhagavata* is a significant work, it is a commentary on the 11th Skanda of the Bhagavata Purana, not the Bhagavad Gita.  This distinction makes statement 2 inaccurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully correct.


**21. With reference to Tukaram's teachings, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tukaram (17th century), a devotee of Vitthala (Vithoba), is known for his devotional poetry (abhanga).
2.  He actively promoted kirtans and opposed gender discrimination and the caste system.
3.  Tukaram's literary works are primarily in Sanskrit, adhering to the classical style of Hindu religious literature.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Tukaram was a prominent figure in the Varkari tradition, known for his powerful abhanga poetry expressing devotion to Vitthala. He actively promoted kirtans as a form of worship and strongly opposed social inequalities like gender discrimination and the caste system. Statement 3 is incorrect. Tukaram's abhangas were composed in Marathi, a vernacular language, not Sanskrit. His choice of language made his work accessible to a broader audience, unlike the more classical Sanskrit. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**22. With reference to Samarth Ramdas's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Samarth Ramdas (17th century), a devotee of Lord Rama and Hanuman, is famous for his Advaita Vedanta text, *Dasbodh*.
2.  He founded the Samarth sect, and his teachings significantly influenced the spiritual life of Shivaji Maharaj.
3.  Samarth Ramdas's literary works primarily focus on the philosophical intricacies of Advaita Vedanta, with little attention to devotional themes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Samarth Ramdas's contributions. He was a prominent spiritual figure known for his *Dasbodh*, a text expounding Advaita Vedanta principles in a practical and accessible manner. He founded the Samarth sect, and his teachings significantly influenced Shivaji Maharaj, a prominent Maratha ruler.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While *Dasbodh* deals with Advaita Vedanta, Samarth Ramdas's writings also incorporate strong devotional elements, reflecting his deep faith and his emphasis on practical application of spiritual principles.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.


**23. With reference to Guru Ghasi Das's teachings, consider the following statements:**

1.  Guru Ghasi Das (18th-19th century), a social reformer from Chhattisgarh, strongly criticized the caste system and advocated equality.
2.  He established the Satnami community, emphasizing a monotheistic faith and rejecting idol worship.
3.  Guru Ghasi Das's teachings were significantly influenced by Sufi mysticism, incorporating many Sufi practices into his spiritual path.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Guru Ghasi Das was a significant social reformer who vehemently opposed the caste system and promoted social equality. He founded the Satnami community, which emphasized the worship of a single God ("Satnam") and rejected idol worship, promoting a simpler form of faith. Statement 3 is inaccurate. While Guru Ghasi Das's teachings might share some broad similarities with certain aspects of other traditions, it is incorrect to state that they were significantly influenced by Sufi mysticism or incorporated Sufi practices. His philosophy was unique and developed within a specific socio-religious context. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.



**1. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine figure.
2. The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others, is central to Mahayana.
3. Mahayana Buddhism promoted image worship and elaborate rituals as essential aspects of practice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key features of Mahayana Buddhism.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which emphasizes individual enlightenment and monastic life, Mahayana Buddhism developed a more expansive cosmology and devotional practices. The deification of the Buddha, transforming him from a historical figure into a divine being worthy of worship, was a significant departure.  The Bodhisattva ideal, central to Mahayana, emphasizes compassion and the selfless dedication to helping all sentient beings achieve enlightenment.  Finally, the use of images and rituals in Mahayana Buddhism became far more prominent than in Theravada, reflecting a shift towards a more accessible and devotional form of practice.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete representations of Mahayana Buddhist tenets.  The comprehensive nature of Mahayana Buddhism encompasses all three aspects mentioned.

**2. With reference to the architectural features of Vijayanagara temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture.
2. Vijayanagara temples predominantly followed the Nagara style of architecture, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas.
3. The Vijayanagara architectural style heavily incorporated Dravidian elements, such as the gopurams and pillared halls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kalyana Mandapas, elaborate wedding pavilions, were a significant architectural addition within the temple complexes of the Vijayanagara empire, reflecting the importance of royal patronage and ritual. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vijayanagara architecture shows a blend of styles, it did not predominantly follow the Nagara style.  The Nagara style is primarily associated with North India, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas (towers). Vijayanagara architecture exhibits a unique synthesis of Dravidian and other regional influences. Statement 3 is correct. Vijayanagara temple architecture demonstrably incorporated Dravidian elements, particularly in the design of gopurams (gateway towers) and spacious pillared halls (mandapas).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

**3. With reference to the Mughal Emperors and their artistic patronage, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Akbar shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to large-scale architectural projects.
2. Emperor Jahangir is known for his patronage of individual portraits and album art, showcasing a shift from the earlier emphasis on illustrated manuscripts.
3.  Emperor Shah Jahan's artistic patronage primarily focused on miniature paintings depicting scenes of courtly life and hunting expeditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar was a great patron of the arts, his patronage encompassed both illustrated manuscripts and architecture. The Akbarnama, a lavishly illustrated manuscript, is a testament to his support for manuscript illumination.  Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir's reign marked a significant shift in Mughal artistic production.  His personal interest in painting led to a flourishing of individual portraits and album art, representing a departure from the earlier emphasis on large-scale illustrated manuscripts. Statement 3 is partially correct but overly simplistic. Shah Jahan's patronage extended beyond miniature paintings; his architectural achievements, like the Taj Mahal, are more renowned. While miniature paintings continued, they weren't the defining characteristic of his artistic patronage.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately captures a key aspect of Mughal artistic development.

**4. With reference to the saints and the Mughal emperor Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbarka was a contemporary of Akbar and engaged in religious discussions with him.
2. Saint Kabir was significantly influenced by the religious ideas of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a contemporary of Akbar.
3. Akbar's religious policies actively promoted interfaith dialogue and the incorporation of diverse religious influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka predates Akbar by several centuries. His philosophical contributions belong to a much earlier period in Indian religious history. Statement 2 is incorrect. Saint Kabir's teachings predate Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Kabir's Bhakti movement emphasized a syncretic approach to religion, blending Hindu and Sufi elements, which existed independently of Sirhindi's later theological contributions. Statement 3 is correct. Akbar's religious policies were characterized by a notable degree of tolerance and an active pursuit of interfaith dialogue. His establishment of the Ibadat Khana and his engagement with scholars from various religious traditions are strong evidence of this. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects a historical fact.


**5. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. Chanhudaro is a well-known Harappan site known for its unique bead-making industry.
2. Kot Diji is considered a pre-Harappan site, representing an earlier phase of the Indus Valley Civilization.
3. Sohgaura is a significant Harappan site in Uttar Pradesh, known for its extensive urban planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, is a notable Harappan site particularly recognized for its advanced bead-making workshops and the absence of a citadel. Statement 2 is also correct. Kot Diji, also in present-day Pakistan, represents an earlier phase of the Indus Valley Civilization, preceding the mature Harappan period. It exhibits features that predate the standardized urban planning seen in later Harappan cities. Statement 3 is incorrect. Sohgaura is *not* a Harappan site. It is associated with the later Mauryan period and is famous for a copper plate inscription, not for Harappan artifacts or urban planning. Consequently, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the sources of knowledge about the Harappan culture, consider the following statements:**

1. Rock edicts of Ashoka provide detailed information about the daily life and social structures of the Harappans.
2. The writing system found on Harappan terracotta seals has been fully deciphered, revealing much about their history and beliefs.
3. Archaeological excavations of Harappan sites have yielded substantial evidence about their material culture, urban planning, and trade networks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ashoka's rock edicts belong to a much later period than the Harappan Civilization. They provide information about Ashoka's reign and policies, not the Harappans. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Harappan script remains undeciphered, limiting direct access to their written records. While scholars continue to study it, no comprehensive understanding of its meaning has yet been achieved. Statement 3 is correct. Archaeological excavations at various Harappan sites (e.g., Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal) have provided extensive data about their urban planning, material culture,  trade connections, and aspects of their daily life.  Therefore, only statement 3 is factually accurate.


**7. With reference to the early Vedic period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rigveda primarily focuses on hymns dedicated to various gods and goddesses, reflecting a polytheistic belief system.
2. The chief livelihood source for the Aryans during the Rigvedic period was agriculture, with a well-established system of irrigation.
3. Idol worship was a prominent religious practice during the early Vedic period, as evidenced by the numerous sculptures and temples discovered from that era.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, is predominantly composed of hymns addressed to various deities, reflecting a polytheistic religious framework.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While agriculture was practiced, it wasn't the dominant economic activity in the early Vedic period. Pastoralism and cattle rearing played a more significant role.  Sophisticated irrigation systems were not yet developed during this phase. Statement 3 is incorrect. Idol worship was not a prominent feature of the early Vedic period.  The focus was on ritualistic sacrifices and hymns, not anthropomorphic deity representations.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**8.  With reference to the  Indus Valley Civilization sites, consider the following statements:**

1. Kalibangan is a significant Harappan site located in present-day Rajasthan, known for its evidence of planned urban layouts.
2. Lothal, situated in present-day Gujarat, is renowned for its well-preserved dockyard, indicating a strong maritime tradition.
3. Alamgirpur, located in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is considered the westernmost extent of the Harappan civilization.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kalibangan, in Rajasthan, is a significant Harappan site showcasing evidence of planned urban development, including grid-like street patterns and fortified settlements. Statement 2 is correct. Lothal, in Gujarat, is famous for its remarkably preserved dockyard, providing strong evidence of their advanced maritime technology and trade.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Alamgirpur in Uttar Pradesh represents one of the *easternmost* settlements of the Harappan civilization, not the westernmost.  The westernmost extent of the civilization reached into present-day Pakistan. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**9. With reference to the  different schools of Indian sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school of art, flourishing during the Kushana period, blended Indian artistic traditions with those of the Greeks and Romans.
2. The Mathura school of art, known for its use of red sandstone, primarily focused on the depiction of Buddhist themes.
3. The Amaravati school of art, noted for its intricate carvings and narrative reliefs, is associated with the Satavahana dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key characteristics of these influential schools of Indian sculpture. The Gandhara school, located in the northwestern region, successfully integrated Greco-Roman artistic elements with existing Indian traditions, particularly in its depictions of the Buddha. The Mathura school, prominent in Uttar Pradesh, is known for its use of red sandstone and its representation of both Buddhist and Brahmanical themes.  The Amaravati school, based in Andhra Pradesh, is renowned for its exquisite carvings, narrative reliefs, and association with the Satavahana dynasty.  Each school had its own distinct style and characteristics, contributing to the rich diversity of Indian sculptural traditions.


**10. With reference to the  major ancient ports of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, situated near the present-day city of Ahmedabad, was a significant port during the Indus Valley Civilization, known for its extensive trade networks.
2. Muziris, located on the Malabar Coast in present-day Kerala, served as a crucial port for trade with the Roman Empire.
3. Tamralipti, situated in present-day Odisha, was a prominent port during the Mauryan period, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's arrival did significantly impact the use of gunpowder in India,  gunpowder technology existed in the subcontinent before his arrival, albeit perhaps less sophisticatedly developed.  The use of gunpowder in warfare and siege weaponry was already present in India during the Delhi Sultanate period, preceding Babur's arrival.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Arches and domes were not novel architectural elements introduced by Babur.  These architectural features were already present in Indian architecture, having been adopted and adapted over centuries through various influences, including pre-Islamic Indian traditions and earlier Islamic architectural styles introduced during the Delhi Sultanate.  Babur's architectural projects, while impressive, built upon existing techniques and styles.


Statement 3 is correct. Babur's successful conquest of Delhi in 1526 laid the foundation for the Mughal Empire, which was a Timurid dynasty.  The Timurids were a Turco-Mongol dynasty that originated in Central Asia. Babur, a direct descendant of Timur (Tamerlane), established the Timurid lineage in India, marking a significant turning point in Indian history.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements about Harappan sites:**

1.  Chanhudaro is known for its absence of a citadel, unlike most other Indus Valley Civilization cities.
2.  Kot Diji represents an early phase of the Indus Valley Civilization, predating the mature Harappan phase.
3.  Sohgaura is renowned for its discovery of a copper plate inscription in Prakrit, dating to the Mauryan period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of archaeological findings related to the Indus Valley Civilization and subsequent periods.  Chanhudaro's unique feature of lacking a citadel distinguishes it from other major Harappan sites, which typically feature a raised citadel area. Kot Diji's archaeological remains indicate a developmental stage preceding the mature Harappan urban centers, showcasing an earlier form of Indus Valley Civilization settlement.  Finally, the Sohgaura copper plate inscription is a significant discovery, but crucially, it's not from the Harappan period; it belongs to the later Mauryan era, highlighting the chronological distinction between these civilizations.  Therefore, understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of these archaeological findings is key to answering this question correctly.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct statement.


**2. With reference to Ashokan inscriptions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kanganahalli inscription uniquely features a stone portrait of Ashoka alongside the inscription "Ranyo Ashoka."
2.  The Shahbazgarhi inscription is written in Kharosthi script and dates back to the 3rd century BC.
3.  The Sanchi Stupa, while a significant Buddhist site, does not contain relief sculptures mentioning Ashoka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect established facts about Ashokan inscriptions. Kanganahalli's inscription is indeed unique for its inclusion of a stone portrait of Ashoka with the Brahmi script label. Shahbazgarhi's inscription, written in Kharosthi script, is also well-documented as belonging to the 3rd century BC.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Sanchi Stupa is an important Buddhist monument, it does not contain relief sculptures explicitly mentioning Ashoka. The Sanchi Stupa's construction predates Ashoka's reign, although it may have been impacted by his influence on the spread of Buddhism.  The other options are therefore incorrect as they misrepresent the accurate information concerning these significant historical sites.  The ability to distinguish between accurately described inscriptions and their locations is crucial for answering this question.


**3. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the deification of the Buddha, elevating him to a divine status.
2.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own enlightenment to help others, is central to Mahayana.
3.  Image worship and elaborate rituals were less prevalent in Mahayana Buddhism compared to other Buddhist sects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe key tenets of Mahayana Buddhism.  The deification of the Buddha is a central aspect, marking a significant divergence from earlier forms of Buddhism. The Bodhisattva ideal, emphasizing compassion and the postponement of Nirvana to aid sentient beings, is also a core principle of Mahayana. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  Image worship and elaborate rituals are indeed characteristic features of Mahayana Buddhism, playing a vital role in its devotional practices.  The other options are incorrect because they either omit a correct statement or include an incorrect one. The question tests the understanding of the core philosophical and ritualistic differences between various schools of Buddhism, requiring a nuanced understanding beyond basic knowledge.


**4. With reference to temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a prominent feature of Vijayanagara architecture.
2.  The Chalukya dynasty is primarily known for its rock-cut cave temples rather than its Kalyana Mandapas.
3.  Chandela temples are renowned for their intricate sculptures and Nagara-style architecture, but not necessarily for Kalyana Mandapas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect aspects of Indian temple architecture and the styles associated with different dynasties.  The Vijayanagara empire's temples are well-known for incorporating Kalyana Mandapas as significant architectural components. The Chalukya dynasty, while known for its contributions to temple architecture, is more prominently associated with rock-cut cave temples.  The Chandela dynasty's temples are recognized for their distinctive Nagara style and intricate sculptural work, although Kalyana Mandapas are not their defining characteristic.  The other options are therefore incorrect, as they fail to encompass the full range of accurate information about these architectural styles and their historical contexts.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of distinct architectural features and their association with specific historical periods and regions.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. While the exact dates of Nimbarka's life are debated, placing him firmly in Akbar's era is not historically supported.  Kabir's teachings are well-known for their rejection of rigid religious boundaries and promotion of a syncretic spiritual approach. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi did oppose Akbar's religious policies, he was not a contemporary of Akbar; he lived after Akbar's death.  The other options are incorrect because they either include an incorrect statement or omit a correct one. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key religious figures, their philosophies, and their historical contexts, requiring accurate recall of biographical details and theological positions.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct representations of established facts about Tansen's life and contributions to Indian classical music.  He was indeed given the title "Mian" by Emperor Akbar. His compositions frequently featured Hindu deities and themes, reflecting the religious and cultural context of his work.  He is also widely recognized for his significant contributions to the development and refinement of various ragas.  The other options are incorrect, as they fail to accurately reflect the totality of information about Tansen's life and musical legacy.  This question assesses not only factual knowledge but also the ability to synthesize information about a prominent figure in Indian history and music.

3.  Shahjahan's era is less known for significant advancements in painting compared to the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the evolution of Mughal painting under different emperors. Akbar's reign is indeed associated with the flourishing of illustrated manuscripts. Jahangir's preference for individual portraits and albums marked a stylistic shift. Humayun's patronage, though less extensive than Akbar's, played a crucial role in establishing the foundations of the Mughal style.  Shahjahan's era, while marked by architectural achievements, saw relatively less innovation in painting compared to the earlier reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct statement.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the chronological development and stylistic changes in a major art form of the Mughal era, requiring knowledge of stylistic shifts across different reigns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur, his military campaigns effectively introduced and disseminated its more advanced forms. Babur's architectural preferences, including the arch and dome, did influence later styles, although the arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before Babur.  His successful campaigns did establish the Timurid dynasty in India, laying the foundation for the Mughal Empire.  The other options are therefore incorrect, as they fail to capture the full extent of Babur's multifaceted impact on the Indian subcontinent. The question tests the understanding of the broader historical context of Babur's arrival and its long-term consequences on India's military technology, architecture and political landscape.


**9. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, created during the Pallava dynasty, are indeed later than the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, which dates back to the Gupta period. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli is a well-known Mauryan-era artifact. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period, predates the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was built much later.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to establish a chronological order of significant works of art and architecture across different historical periods and regions, demanding precise knowledge of dating.

The Kalinga War represents a turning point, marking Ashoka's abandonment of aggressive expansionism in favor of a policy of non-violence and the propagation of Buddhism.  This shift in his approach to governance is well-documented. The Maski inscription is indeed significant for its use of Ashoka's name,  a departure from his earlier regnal titles. This detail provides valuable insight into the evolution of his image and public presentation. Lastly, the Kalsi inscription stands out as the only site in North India containing the full set of Ashoka's 14 rock edicts, written in Prakrit using the Brahmi script.  Its unique status makes it a crucial source for understanding Ashoka's policies and beliefs. The accuracy of these details makes all three statements correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about the architectural impact of Babur's arrival in India:**

1. Babur's arrival directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology in India's military.
2.  The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture is directly attributable to Babur's influence.
3. Babur established the Timurid dynasty in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Babur did utilize gunpowder effectively, its presence in India predates his arrival.  The technology had already diffused into the region through various channels before Babur's campaigns.  His use of gunpowder, however, did significantly impact the nature of warfare in the subcontinent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before Babur.  While the Timurids brought certain refinements and stylistic influences, the assertion of a direct introduction is historically inaccurate.  Central Asian architectural elements did blend with pre-existing Indian styles during the Mughal era, but the claim of a sole introduction by Babur is a simplification.

Statement 3 is correct. Babur's successful conquest of Delhi laid the foundation for the Timurid dynasty in India, which would later evolve into the Mughal Empire.  His victory marked a significant turning point in Indian history, establishing a new era of rule.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is older than the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram predate the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves.
3. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli represents a style of art that is distinctly different from the style of the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, created during the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar (constructed much later, primarily between the 11th and 13th centuries CE).  This demonstrates the long and diverse history of Indian art and architecture, showing different styles and periods.

Statement 2 is correct. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th century CE, preceding the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves (created during the Gupta period, 5th century CE).  The chronological order highlights the evolution of architectural styles across different eras.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While both sculptures represent distinct styles, it's an oversimplification to say they are *distinctly* different. Both styles reflect Indian artistic sensibilities, but they are separated by centuries and show evolution in sculpting techniques and iconography.  The Mauryan style is characterized by its grandeur and symbolic representation, while the Gupta style displays a more refined and naturalistic approach.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Pushkar is situated near the Aravalli Range in Rajasthan, but Omkareshwar's location is not on the Aravalli hills but on an island formed by the Narmada River. The statement incorrectly combines the locations.

Statement 3 is correct. Srisailam is a significant Shiva temple, and Omkareshwar is also dedicated to Shiva. Pushkar is renowned for its Brahma temple, making it a unique pilgrimage site.  The religious significance of these places underscores their importance in Indian religious practices.


**4. With reference to Buddhist history, tradition and culture in India, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights Lothal's dockyard and its importance in trade.

Statement 2 is also correct. The description clearly mentions Muziris' location and its prominence in Sangam literature, signifying its historical significance as a major port.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Tamralipti was a significant port, the text emphasizes its role as an exit point for trade routes to the south and southeast, not specifically the spice trade.  The question tries to create a distractor by focusing on a specific trade item.

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Pingala's work is mentioned,  the text links it to the binary number system and the matrameru (which is related to the Fibonacci sequence), but doesn't claim it's the *earliest known* description of the Fibonacci sequence. The claim of "earliest known" is the key distractor.

Gupta coinage, a high point of Indian numismatic art, is characterized by its gold standard and the diverse depictions of the emperor on one side and deities or the queen on the reverse. Rajendra I's Chola coins are indeed known for their inscriptions including "Gangaikonda Chola" and the symbolic use of the tiger and fish. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one accurate statement.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the distinct characteristics of different dynasties' coinage systems.

The Khajuraho temples are indeed famous for their extensive and detailed carvings encompassing a wide range of subjects.

3.  The Varkari sect, associated with the worship of Vithoba, a form of Vishnu, included influential figures like Dnyaneshwar, author of the Dnyaneshwari, and Tukaram, known for his devotional poetry (Abhanga) and promotion of kirtans.

2. The Western Satraps' coinage featured the Saka era dating back to 78 AD and often depicted Buddhist chaityas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of ancient Indian coinage. The Satavahanas, known for their extensive rule from 232 BC to 227 AD, primarily utilized lead for their coins, although silver and copper were also used, making statement 1 correct.  The Western Satraps, ruling in Western India from 35-405 AD, were of Saka origin and their coins are historically significant for their use of the Saka era dating system, commencing in 78 AD.  The inclusion of Buddhist chaitya or stupa imagery on these coins further supports the accuracy of statement 2.  Statement 3 is also correct as Gupta coinage, primarily gold, is renowned for its artistic merit.  The depiction of the emperor in various activities, both martial and leisurely, alongside images of Goddess Lakshmi on the reverse, is a well-documented feature of Gupta numismatics. Therefore, the comprehensive and accurate representation of the coinage practices of these three dynasties makes option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the factually accurate statements.

**1. Consider the following statements about Harappan Civilization:**

1. The Harappan civilization lacked evidence of monumental architecture like palaces or temples, unlike later civilizations.
2.  The presence of both male and female deities in Harappan iconography suggests a complex religious system.
3.  Horse-drawn chariots were a prominent feature of Harappan warfare, as evidenced by numerous archaeological finds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization didn't have the massive, elaborate structures of later periods, evidence suggests the existence of large public buildings and planned urban layouts, indicating sophisticated engineering and civic planning.  The absence of clear-cut palaces or temples as seen in later Indian civilizations doesn't equate to a lack of monumental architecture altogether. The interpretation of what constitutes "monumental" varies across historical periods and cultures.


Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological discoveries of figurines and seals depict both male and female deities, indicating a multifaceted religious system beyond simple patriarchal structures.  The exact nature and significance of these deities are still debated, but the presence of both genders challenges simplistic interpretations of Harappan religion.


Statement 3 is incorrect. There's limited direct evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in Harappan warfare. While horse bones have been found at some sites, their precise role in warfare remains uncertain.  Other forms of transportation and weaponry were likely more prevalent. The depiction of chariots in later periods shouldn't be extrapolated to the Harappan context without robust evidence.  The presence of horses doesn't automatically imply their use in warfare in the way it might be interpreted in later periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only

This standardization suggests a centralized authority or at least a widespread shared understanding of measurement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While evidence suggests religious practices existed in the Harappan civilization, the assertion of a single, supreme deity with widespread iconic representation is an oversimplification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the coinage of these dynasties.  The Satavahanas, known for their extensive but artistically unrefined coinage, primarily utilized lead and less frequently, silver or potin (a silver-copper alloy).  Their coins often featured symbols like elephants, horses, lions, or chaityas.  The Western Satraps, of Saka origin, incorporated the Saka era dating system on their coins and frequently borrowed the Buddhist chaitya motif from the Satavahanas.  Gupta coinage, a hallmark of the Gupta era's artistic flourishing, predominantly consisted of gold coins.  A common design featured the emperor depicted in various activities (martial or otherwise) on one side and Goddess Lakshmi (or occasionally other deities or the queen) on the reverse.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the text mentions Roman traders having far-reaching connections,  it does not explicitly link them to the spread of Indian culture *as Gypsies*. The association of Roman traders with Gypsies is a separate historical claim requiring further verification and is not explicitly supported by the provided text.  The text clearly states that Ashoka sent his son and daughter to Sri Lanka to spread Buddhism, and that the Kalinga dynasty fostered trade relations with Sri Lanka, leading to cultural exchanges. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are directly supported by the provided information.


**3. With reference to the Coinage Act, 2011, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Coinage Act, 2011, superseded the 1906 act. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that the definition of a 'coin' under the 2011 act includes coins made of any metal *or other material* stamped by the government or authorized entity, and this explicitly includes the Government of India's one rupee note. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The text clearly mentions that penalties are prescribed for forgery relating to minting, etc., *and* this implicitly includes the forgery of government-issued one rupee notes which are considered 'coins' under the act.

1. The use of Sanskrit and Greek languages on Indo-Greek coins is well-documented.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Indo-Greek coins frequently featured both Greek and Sanskrit inscriptions, reflecting the cultural fusion of the time. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Kushan empire produced a vast number of coins, the text does not specify that Kanishka primarily used lead.  The text mentions Kanishka mostly issued lead coins.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Qutub Minar's construction indeed began under the Mamluks, and its design incorporates elements from both Indo-Islamic and pre-existing structures, such as the repurposed materials from earlier Hindu and Jain temples.  The Alai Darwaza, built by Alauddin Khilji, is a prime example of the Seljuk architectural style prevalent during his reign.  Its use of red sandstone and detailed carvings are hallmarks of this style.

(c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Babur's reign was short, and his architectural projects were mainly mosques, not known for elaborate designs. Humayun's Tomb, while completed posthumously, is a pivotal work demonstrating the growing influence of Persian architectural styles in Mughal architecture.  It marked a significant departure from earlier styles and is considered a precursor to later Mughal architectural grandeur.  Sher Shah Suri, during his relatively brief rule, did leave behind architectural works such as the Qila-e-Kuhnah mosque and Rohtas Fort, representing a clear link between the ending Lodi and the developing early Mughal architectural styles.  These structures exhibited features that bridged the stylistic gap between the two eras. Thus, all three statements accurately represent aspects of Mughal architectural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bengal school prominently used readily available bricks and black marble, often incorporating the characteristic sloping roofs of the region into its mosque designs.  The Jaunpur (Sharqi) school indeed distinguished itself through the use of calligraphy as a major decorative element, setting it apart from other styles that often featured minars. The Malwa school's architecture did utilize varied colored stones and marbles, included large windows (potentially influenced by European designs), and employed the "batter" technique for structural reinforcement, a method introduced earlier by the Tughlaqs.  Therefore, all three statements correctly describe features of these regional architectural styles during the Delhi Sultanate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

The Nayanmars, devotees of Shiva, were known for their emphasis on asceticism as a path to spiritual liberation and their compilation of devotional poems, the Tevaram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ramanuja's contributions to Sri Vaishnavism and his advocacy of Vishishtadvaita, a philosophy that reconciles the oneness of Brahman with the distinct existence of individual souls, are well-documented. Madhvacharya's staunch Dvaita philosophy, which emphasized the inherent difference between the individual soul and the ultimate reality, is a significant contrast to Advaita Vedanta, and his critiques of Shankara are historically important. Vallabhacharya's establishment of the Pushti Marg sect and his propagation of Shuddha Advaita, emphasizing a path to salvation through intense love and devotion to Krishna, are key aspects of his legacy.  All three statements accurately reflect the philosophical positions and contributions of these important Bhakti saints.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Megasthenes' Indica, despite the loss of the original text, remains a significant source of information on Mauryan India, offering insights into its administration, social structures, and religious practices, even if some aspects are interpreted through a Greek lens. Fa-Hien's account offers invaluable firsthand insights into the religious and social life of India during the Gupta period, highlighting the presence of both Buddhism and Hinduism and contributing to our understanding of their interaction. Al-Biruni's Kitab-ul-Hind stands as a remarkable study of India, showcasing his command of Sanskrit and his detailed examination of Indian society, culture, and scientific knowledge, particularly in mathematics and astronomy.

2.  The Ujjain symbol, a cross with four circles, was a common feature on Satavahana coins.
3.  Kushan coinage significantly influenced the design and production of coins by various subsequent tribal groups and kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of early Indian coinage.  The Satavahanas are known for their predominantly lead coins, with silver being less common. The Ujjain symbol is indeed a distinctive feature frequently found on their coinage.

This widespread influence underscores the Kushan's impact on numismatic practices across a wide geographical area.  There's no evidence to suggest any of these statements are incorrect.

This includes commemorative coins and even the one rupee note issued by the Government of India, making statement 2 too narrow in its interpretation.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the numismatic practices of the Wodeyar dynasty and its successors. King Kanthiraya Narasa's coins did indeed feature the Narasimha avatar. Haidar Ali, after overthrowing the Wodeyars, initially maintained the use of their coinage, incorporating imagery of Shiva and Parvati. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the text specifies that the coins of King Kanthiraya Narasa were made of a material weighing only six to eight grains, and while the text doesn't specify the material, it suggests that the quantity of metal is small, and it is highly unlikely that it would be silver. The text does not provide enough information to determine the usual metal used in the coinage of the Wodeyar dynasty.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverged from earlier Buddhist traditions by elevating the Buddha to a divine status, a key difference from Theravada Buddhism's focus on the Buddha as an enlightened teacher. The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, became central to Mahayana practice and philosophy.  Statement 3 is incorrect; image worship and elaborate rituals were indeed integral to Mahayana Buddhism, forming a crucial part of its devotional practice.  The emphasis on devotional practices and the accessibility of Buddhist teachings to a broader audience were key features of Mahayana's spread and appeal. This stands in contrast to the earlier Hinayana schools which emphasized individual practice and self-reliance.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti movement's origins in South India, with the Alvars and Nayanmars playing a pivotal role in its early development, are well-established.  Their devotional poetry and emphasis on personal bhakti paved the way for its later spread to North India. Statement 2 is partially correct. While some Bhakti saints emphasized a formless, attributeless God (Nirguna), others focused on a God with form and attributes (Saguna).  The movement's approach to idol worship and ritual varied considerably among different saints and sects. Statement 3 is entirely incorrect; a key aspect of the Bhakti movement was its challenge to the rigid caste system, promoting a more inclusive and egalitarian social order.  Many Bhakti saints actively worked towards breaking down social barriers based on caste.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Akbar's architectural projects, such as Fatehpur Sikri, prominently featured red sandstone and incorporated architectural elements reflecting a blend of Indian and Persian styles including the introduction of the four-centered arch.  Jahangir, while less focused on large-scale construction than Akbar, oversaw the construction of the tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah, marking a significant shift towards the use of white marble, a trend that would become even more prominent under Shah Jahan. Statement 3 is incorrect; Aurangzeb, known for his austere religious views, significantly curtailed the scale and ambition of Mughal architectural projects.  While some construction continued, it lacked the grandeur and innovation of earlier reigns. His architectural patronage was minimal compared to his predecessors.

3. Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler, visited India during the reign of Akbar and provided valuable insights into the Mughal court and administration in his work, Rihla.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Megasthenes' Indica, though largely lost, is known through fragments and secondary sources, offering valuable glimpses into Mauryan India.  Fa-Hien's detailed account of his travels during the Gupta period provides crucial information about Buddhism and the socio-religious life of that era. Statement 3 is incorrect; Ibn Battuta visited India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, not Akbar, and his detailed travelogue, Rihla, offers rich insights into the social and political dynamics of the Delhi Sultanate.  The accounts of these travelers, though written from different perspectives, provide valuable complementary information for understanding ancient and medieval India.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Nagara style, with its distinctive curvilinear shikharas, is a hallmark of North Indian temple architecture.  The Dravida style, with its monumental gopurams and elaborate carvings, is a defining characteristic of South Indian temple architecture. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Vesara style does blend elements of both Nagara and Dravida styles, it is predominantly found in Karnataka and not Odisha.  The Vesara style demonstrates the creative fusion of architectural traditions across different regions of India.


**8. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Qutub Minar, initially a minaret, was later converted into a mosque during the reign of Alauddin Khilji.
2. The Tughlaq dynasty's architectural style was characterized by the use of grey sandstone and a focus on structural strength over ornamentation.
3. The Lodi dynasty's architectural contributions primarily consisted of tombs, characterized by the use of double domes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Qutub Minar is a significant structure, it was not converted into a mosque during Alauddin Khilji's reign;  the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque within the same complex predates Khilji's rule. The Tughlaq dynasty's architecture is indeed known for its use of grey sandstone and its emphasis on structural robustness, reflecting a pragmatic approach.  The Lodi dynasty, towards the end of the Delhi Sultanate, did focus primarily on tomb construction, and the introduction of the double dome is a distinctive feature of their architectural style.  The evolution of architectural styles within the Delhi Sultanate reflects the changing political and cultural dynamics of the period.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization's advanced urban planning is a well-documented aspect, with cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa exhibiting grid layouts, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. Statement 2 is incorrect; the religious beliefs of the Indus Valley Civilization are not fully understood, but evidence suggests a more complex system involving both male and female deities, along with other symbolic representations.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while evidence of animal domestication exists, there is no conclusive evidence of widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in the Indus Valley Civilization during its known period.  The limited evidence available suggests a more agrarian and trade-focused society.


**10. With reference to the post-Mauryan art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school of art, flourishing in the northwest, blended Greco-Roman and Indian artistic traditions, prominently depicting the Buddha in human form.
2. The Mathura school of art, centered in the Gangetic plains, primarily used sandstone as its medium and focused on the depiction of various Hindu deities.
3. The Amaravati school of art, located in Andhra Pradesh, was characterized by its use of stucco and its depiction of scenes from the Jataka tales.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gandhara school is indeed known for its fusion of Greco-Roman and Indian artistic styles, particularly in its representations of the Buddha, a departure from earlier aniconic traditions.  The Mathura school, a significant center of artistic production, primarily utilized sandstone and depicted a wide range of Hindu deities. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Amaravati school was located in Andhra Pradesh and did depict Jataka tales, its primary medium was not stucco but rather limestone.  The Amaravati school is known for its exquisite carvings and its contribution to the development of early Buddhist art.  The different schools reflect the diverse regional styles and influences within post-Mauryan India.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Harappan Civilization:**

1. The Harappan civilization lacked evidence of monumental architecture like large palaces or temples.
2.  The discovery of terracotta figurines and seals depicts the worship of both male and female deities.
3. Horse-drawn chariots were commonly used for warfare in the Harappan civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Harappan civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning and engineering, with well-developed drainage systems and standardized brick sizes,  large-scale monumental architecture comparable to later civilizations is largely absent.  The emphasis was on public works and civic amenities rather than grand palaces or temples.  The absence of clear evidence for a centralized, hierarchical power structure also supports this interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological discoveries at various Harappan sites, including the famous "Priest-King" statue from Mohenjo-daro and numerous terracotta figurines, reveal a complex religious system involving the worship of both male and female deities.  The presence of mother goddesses and other symbolic representations demonstrates a rich and diverse religious landscape. The exact nature of their beliefs remains a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, but the evidence firmly establishes the existence of a pantheon of gods and goddesses.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While evidence suggests the Harappans were familiar with horses, there's no conclusive archaeological evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare. The presence of horse remains at some sites doesn't automatically translate to their military application.  Furthermore, the Harappan military technology, as understood from current evidence, doesn't seem to have been heavily reliant on chariots.  Other forms of weaponry and defense systems may have been employed.


**2. With reference to Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kailasa Temple at Ellora is a monolithic structure carved out of a single rock.

3. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram are primarily associated with the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kailasa Temple at Ellora is a remarkable example of rock-cut architecture, uniquely carved out of a single rock. This feat of engineering and artistic skill demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the artisans of that era. The scale and complexity of the carving are unparalleled in Indian rock-cut architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ajanta caves are renowned for their exquisite Buddhist mural paintings, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and other Buddhist narratives.  Ellora, on the other hand, showcases a remarkable confluence of religious traditions, with caves dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, reflecting the syncretic nature of religious expression in that period. Each religious tradition is represented with its distinct style and iconography.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram are associated with the Pallava dynasty, which flourished between the 7th and 9th centuries CE, significantly after the Gupta period.  The Pallava style, characterized by its intricate carvings and monumental scale, is distinct from the artistic styles of the Gupta period. The Gupta period is known for its distinct sculptural and architectural style, characterized by elegance and refinement.


**3. With reference to the Mauryan Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock Edicts of Ashoka were inscribed in Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.
2.  The Kalinga War marked Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism and his subsequent adoption of the policy of Dhamma.
3. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, authored the Arthashastra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ashoka's Rock Edicts, which spread his message of Dhamma, were inscribed in both Brahmi (used in the north and central India) and Kharosthi (used in the northwest). This demonstrates the empire's vast geographical reach and Ashoka's efforts to communicate his message to a diverse population across different linguistic regions.  The use of multiple scripts reflects the administrative and communicative sophistication of the Mauryan Empire.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Kalinga War, a brutal conflict, is traditionally associated with Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.  The violence and suffering witnessed during the war profoundly impacted Ashoka, leading him to renounce violence and adopt a policy of non-violent rule and the propagation of Dhamma.  The inscriptions that followed reflect this significant shift in Ashoka's approach to governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Arthashastra, a treatise on statecraft and political economy, is attributed to Kautilya (also known as Chanakya), the chief advisor to Chandragupta Maurya, not Megasthenes. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, wrote Indica, which offers valuable insights into Mauryan society and administration, but it's not the Arthashastra.  Both texts provide crucial information about the Mauryan period but were authored by different individuals.


**4. Consider the following statements about medieval Indian history:**

1. The Cholas were known for their extensive maritime trade and the construction of magnificent temples.
2. The Vijayanagara Empire is associated with the development of Kalyana Mandapas in temple architecture.
3.  The Rajput kingdoms were primarily located in the Deccan region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cholas, a powerful dynasty of South India, were renowned for their sophisticated naval capabilities and extensive maritime trade networks. Their maritime prowess extended across the Indian Ocean, facilitating the exchange of goods and cultural ideas.  They also built numerous impressive temples, showcasing advanced architectural and sculptural skills. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur is a prime example of their architectural achievements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire, another prominent South Indian kingdom, is known for its distinctive style of temple architecture, which included the Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions). These structures were integral components of the larger temple complexes, often elaborately decorated and showcasing the empire's artistic and architectural sophistication.  The Vittala Temple at Hampi exemplifies this architectural feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Rajput kingdoms were primarily located in North-West and Central India, not the Deccan. The Deccan plateau was the seat of power for other kingdoms like the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Vijayanagara.  The Rajput kingdoms, known for their martial traditions and rich artistic patronage, played a different role in the political and cultural landscape of medieval India.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar introduced the Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic religious system.
2.  Shah Jahan is primarily associated with the construction of the Taj Mahal.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Emperor Akbar, known for his religious tolerance and syncretic approach, introduced Din-i Ilahi, a new religious system that attempted to blend elements from various faiths prevalent in his empire.  It aimed to foster religious harmony and unity but ultimately didn't achieve widespread acceptance.  It shows Akbar's attempt to promote a unified religious identity within his diverse empire.

Statement 2 is correct. Shah Jahan, known for his extravagant architectural projects, commissioned the construction of the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is a globally recognized symbol of Mughal architecture and a testament to Shah Jahan's artistic and architectural patronage. It's considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) significantly weakened the Maratha Confederacy, it didn't directly mark the decline of the Mughal Empire.  The Mughal Empire had already been in a state of decline for some time before the battle, with its power gradually eroding due to internal conflicts and the rise of regional powers. The battle further weakened the already waning Mughal authority.


**6. With reference to Indian painting styles, consider the following statements:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of Vijayanagara and subsequent coinage. The empire's coinage system was indeed characterized by gold pagodas as the higher denomination, alongside fractional units in gold and silver.  The Wodeyar dynasty's continuation of certain coinage practices, including the depiction of Hindu deities, is also supported by historical evidence. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Vijayanagara coins used both Kannada and Sanskrit inscriptions, reflecting the empire's multilingual context.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to their failure to accurately represent the historical facts.

The Tughlaqs prioritized strength, using grey sandstone and techniques like "batter" for their constructions.  The Khiljis, on the other hand, utilized red sandstone and introduced the arcuade style.  Any option that excludes any of these established facts is incorrect.

Domingo Paes's detailed observations on Krishnadeva Raya's reign remain a significant source for understanding the Vijayanagara Empire.  Any option omitting one or more of these established facts is incorrect.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Abanindranath Tagore's central role in the Bengal School is well-established. Rabindranath Tagore's broader intellectual influence also impacted the artistic movement, albeit indirectly. However, Satyendranath Tagore's contribution to the Bengal School of Art is not historically documented; therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Only option (a) accurately reflects the correct information.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival in India marked the introduction of gunpowder warfare techniques to the subcontinent.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the use of arches and domes, was significantly influenced by pre-existing Indian architectural traditions.
3. Babur's conquest of Delhi led to the immediate and widespread adoption of Persian administrative systems throughout India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's army effectively utilized gunpowder weaponry, a technology relatively new to the Indian subcontinent, contributing to his military success and marking a significant shift in warfare.  However,  it's crucial to note that rudimentary forms of gunpowder were present in India before Babur's arrival, but his introduction of advanced techniques and weaponry from Central Asia had a transformative impact.

Statement 2 is also correct. While Babur and subsequent Mughal rulers did introduce elements of Timurid architecture, characterized by arches and domes, it's inaccurate to suggest that it wholly replaced or overshadowed existing Indian architectural styles.  The Mughal architectural style was a synthesis, incorporating and adapting pre-existing Indian elements and techniques, creating a unique blend. The evolution wasn’t a complete replacement but a fusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Babur did introduce certain administrative practices, the adoption of Persian systems was a gradual process, spanning several decades and influenced by the existing administrative frameworks within the subcontinent.  The claim of immediate and widespread adoption is an oversimplification of a complex historical process.  The transition was more nuanced and involved a continuous interplay between existing Indian systems and those introduced by the Mughals.

Statement 1 is correct. The Lingaraja Temple, a significant example of Kalinga architecture (a sub-style of Nagara), is renowned for its complex structure, intricate carvings, and the imposing height of its shikhara (tower).  Its architectural style reflects the evolution of temple design in eastern India.

Statement 2 is correct. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, a Mauryan-era sculpture, is indeed older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which belong to the Pallava period. This chronological difference reflects the evolution of rock-cut architecture in different parts of India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Varaha image (boar incarnation of Vishnu) at Udayagiri Caves is a testament to the artistic skill of the Gupta period.  The sculpture's detailing, its depiction of the divine figure, and its overall aesthetic quality exemplify the Gupta period's contribution to Indian sculptural traditions. The stylistic elements and the quality of the sculpture clearly point to its Gupta origins.

Statement 3 is correct. Pushkar, located in the Aravalli range of Rajasthan, is famous for its Brahma Temple, making it a significant pilgrimage site.  Its association with the Aravalli hills is a key aspect of its geographical and spiritual context.  The location within the Aravalli range is integral to its identity as a pilgrimage destination.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about Kalidasa:**

1. Kalidasa's play "Malavikagnimitra" is renowned for its intricate plot and exploration of courtly intrigue.
2.  "Kumarasambhava" is an epic poem by Kalidasa detailing the birth of Kumara, the war god.
3. Kalidasa's works primarily focus on themes of war and political strategy, reflecting the turbulent times of the Gupta period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. "Malavikagnimitra" is indeed one of Kalidasa's famous plays, known for its complex plot involving love, politics, and royal court dynamics.

Statement 2 is also correct. "Kumarasambhava" is a celebrated epic poem by Kalidasa narrating the birth of Kartikeya (Kumara), the son of Shiva and Parvati.  It explores themes of divine love and cosmic creation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Kalidasa's works do touch upon political themes in some plays, his body of work is primarily characterized by its exploration of romantic love, nature, and the human condition.  His plays, like "Abhijnanashakuntalam" and "Vikramorvasiyam," are renowned for their lyrical beauty and focus on human relationships, rather than solely on war and political strategy.  The assertion that his works *primarily* focus on war and political strategy is a misrepresentation of his literary contributions.

1. Shashanka's reign is definitively dated from 600 to 625 CE based on numerous contemporary inscriptions.
2.  He is known for his staunch support of Buddhism, evident in his patronage of numerous Buddhist monasteries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Shashanka is known for being a patron of Hinduism and actively opposing Buddhism.  His actions, such as the alleged destruction of Buddhist stupas, contradict the notion of him being a staunch supporter of Buddhism.

Statement 3 is correct.  Historical accounts, though debated in their details, do indicate that Shashanka engaged in the destruction of Buddhist stupas in Bengal, demonstrating his anti-Buddhist stance. This act is considered a significant event in the religious landscape of early Bengal.

This account is a crucial primary source for understanding Harshavardhana's era.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Harshavardhana initially worshipped Shiva and Surya, he later converted to Mahayana Buddhism and adopted its non-violent principles.  The assertion that he remained a devout follower of Shiva throughout his life is inaccurate.

While Dharma Pala is indeed associated with the monasteries at Somapuri and Paharpur,  Tibetan accounts attribute the establishment of Odantapuri to him as well, although there are differing accounts about its construction.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan city of Lothal is known for its well-planned dockyard, indicating significant maritime activity.
2.  Rakhigarhi, located in Haryana, is considered the largest known Harappan site, showcasing extensive urban planning.
3.  Dholavira, in Gujarat, is notable for its advanced water management system, including a large reservoir and unique water harnessing techniques.  

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All three statements accurately reflect key features of the Harappan Civilization. Lothal's dockyard is well-documented archaeological evidence of its maritime trade capabilities. Rakhigarhi's size and the scale of its urban planning have made it the largest known Harappan site to date. Dholavira's sophisticated water management system stands out as a testament to the advanced engineering and urban planning skills of the Harappans.  The options attempting to exclude one or more of these facts are incorrect and represent plausible distractors designed to test the examinee’s thorough understanding of the Harappan civilization.


**2. With reference to Ashokan inscriptions, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  Kanganahalli does indeed possess a stone sculpture of Ashoka with the inscription "Ranyo Ashoka". The Maski inscription is correctly identified as the first to use Ashoka's name, a crucial detail often overlooked. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while Kalsi has a significant number of Ashokan edicts, it does *not* contain all fourteen. This inaccuracy serves as a critical distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the locations and contents of Ashokan inscriptions.


**3. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe core tenets of Mahayana Buddhism. The Bodhisattva ideal and the importance of image worship and rituals are defining characteristics that distinguish Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism. However, statement 3 is false; Mahayana Buddhism developed distinct from early Buddhist schools and incorporates later interpretations and developments not found in the Pali Canon. This incorrect statement is included to test the examinee's nuanced understanding of the Mahayana tradition and its relationship to other Buddhist schools.


**4. With reference to temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The Kalyana Mandapas are indeed a hallmark of Vijayanagara temple architecture.  The Dravidian style is correctly associated with South India and its defining features. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Nagara style is primarily found in North India, and its description of curvilinear shikharas is also accurate, but its geographical placement is wrong. This serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the geographical distribution of different temple architectural styles.


**5. With reference to  Mughal art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah marks a significant shift towards the use of white marble as the primary building material in Mughal architecture.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct observations about Mughal and related architectural styles. The Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah is correctly identified as a pivotal transition point in Mughal building materials. The Rajput architectural style's distinctive incorporation of jharokhas is also accurate. However, statement 2 is false; Shah Jahan's reign is actually considered the *high point* of Mughal architecture, not its decline.  This incorrect statement functions as a significant distractor, challenging the candidate's knowledge of the chronology of Mughal architectural development.


**6. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Saint Nimbarka, a prominent Vaishnava saint, is known for his Dvaitadvaita philosophy, a synthesis of dualism and non-dualism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly identify aspects of the Bhakti movement. Nimbarka's Dvaitadvaita philosophy is accurately described.  The relationship between Ramananda, Kabir, and Ravidas is also historically accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Alvars were Vaishnava, not Shaiva, saints. This false statement acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the different schools and figures within the Bhakti movement.


**7. With reference to Sufi orders in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chishti order, known for its emphasis on tolerance and inclusivity, gained significant prominence in India through figures like Nizamuddin Auliya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of Sufi orders in India. The Chishti order's emphasis on tolerance and its association with Nizamuddin Auliya are well-established facts. The Naqshbandi order's association with Aurangzeb is also historically correct. However, statement 3 is a simplification and overgeneralization of the Suhrawardi order's approach.  While intellectual pursuits were certainly part of their tradition, it's not their defining characteristic. This incorrect statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances within different Sufi orders.


**8. With reference to foreign travelers to India, consider the following statements:**

1. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador, provided valuable insights into the Mauryan empire in his work, Indica.
2. Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler, described the efficient postal system of the Delhi Sultanate in his travelogue, Rihla.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the contributions of Megasthenes and Ibn Battuta.  Megasthenes' Indica offers valuable information on the Mauryan period. Ibn Battuta's Rihla includes detailed accounts of India, including its postal system.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while Marco Polo did travel to India, he is not primarily known for detailed accounts of Indian diamond mines. That distinction belongs to Jean-Baptiste Tavernier.  The inclusion of this false statement serves as a crucial distractor, testing the examinee's ability to differentiate between the accounts of various foreign travelers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the contributions of Ahilyabai Holkar and Rudrama Devi. Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage of temples and infrastructure is well-documented. Rudrama Devi's status as a successful female ruler is also a significant historical fact. However, statement 3 is partly incorrect; while Amir Khusrau was a highly influential musician and poet, the invention of the sitar is not definitively attributed to him. The inclusion of this partially incorrect statement serves as a critical distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the complex history of musical instrument development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the GI tag system in India. The 1999 act is correctly identified as the governing legislation. The unique status of Hyderabad Haleem as a GI-tagged dish is also accurate. The protective nature of the GI tag, safeguarding product names and ensuring quality associated with a region, is also a key feature of the system.  There are no distractors here, as all statements are factually correct, but the question tests the examinee's overall understanding of the GI tagging system.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise knowledge and the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.  The inclusion of plausible distractors further enhances the difficulty level, making them suitable for a competitive examination like the UPSC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key tenets of Mahayana Buddhism.  Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverged from Theravada Buddhism by elevating the Buddha to a divine status, emphasizing his compassion and ability to guide sentient beings towards enlightenment. The Bodhisattva ideal, where enlightened beings delay their own liberation to aid others, is a cornerstone of Mahayana philosophy and practice. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism, in contrast to some interpretations of Theravada, actively embraced image worship (iconography) and elaborate rituals as pathways to devotion and spiritual growth.  These practices were believed to facilitate connection with the Buddha and Bodhisattvas and enhance spiritual progress.

(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kalyana Mandapas were a prominent feature of Vijayanagara architecture, not the Chalukyas.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Sharqi architectural style, associated with Jaunpur, is actually known for *avoiding* the extensive use of minarets, a feature more common in other Indo-Islamic styles.  Statement 3 is correct. The Malwa school of architecture, flourishing in regions like Mandu, is indeed renowned for its use of diverse coloured stones and marbles, and it notably eschewed the prominent use of minarets which were often a central feature in other architectural styles.

2. The introduction of the arch and dome became a defining feature of Indian architecture following Babur's conquests.
3. Babur's reign directly led to the establishment of the Mughal dynasty in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While statement 3 is incorrect as the Timurid dynasty was already established before Babur's arrival and it was Babur who established the Mughal dynasty, statements 1 and 2 are largely correct.  Babur's forces did utilize gunpowder weaponry effectively, contributing to their success and influencing subsequent military technology in India.  Although the arch and dome existed in India prior to Babur, his arrival and the subsequent Mughal architectural style significantly popularized and further developed these elements, leading to a profound transformation of Indian architecture.  It's important to note that the impact wasn't immediate and universal; pre-existing architectural traditions continued, but the Mughal style became highly influential.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the architectural changes introduced after Babur's arrival in India.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, belonging to the Gupta period (5th century CE), is older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were created by the Pallavas in the 7th century CE.  Only statement 3 is correct; the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli is indeed a prime example of Mauryan art and architecture.  The other statements demonstrate a misunderstanding of the chronology of these important archaeological sites.

The distinction between architectural styles and social or religious organizations is crucial for understanding Indian cultural history.  Thus, only statement 1 is correct.

The Ibadat Khana was not a mosque in the traditional sense, nor was it exclusively for the royal family. Its most significant function was as a space where Akbar engaged in debates and discussions with religious scholars from different faiths, reflecting his interest in religious syncretism.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the primary function of the Ibadat Khana.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, including a grid-like road network and advanced drainage systems.
2.  Evidence suggests the Harappans practiced a form of agriculture that included the cultivation of wheat, barley, and possibly rice.
3.  Significant Harappan sites, such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, have yielded evidence of a centralized political structure with a powerful ruling elite.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological excavations at major Harappan sites reveal a remarkably well-planned urban layout.  The grid pattern of streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes demonstrate advanced urban planning capabilities far exceeding contemporary civilizations.  This urban planning is a hallmark of the Harappan civilization, indicating a high level of societal organization and engineering skills.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The discovery of wheat and barley grains at various Harappan sites confirms the practice of agriculture.  While evidence for rice cultivation is debated among scholars, the presence of other crops clearly indicates a significant dependence on agriculture for subsistence. The sophisticated irrigation systems found in some regions further support this conclusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there's evidence of social stratification within Harappan society, the existence of a centralized, powerful ruling elite is not definitively proven. The absence of monumental architecture comparable to palaces or temples in other civilizations suggests a different form of social and political organization, possibly more decentralized or based on different power structures than those found in later civilizations.  The interpretation of the available evidence remains a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.  Therefore, the claim of a powerful ruling elite is an oversimplification.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  The concept of the Buddha as a divine figure, worthy of worship and veneration, is central to Mahayana Buddhism.
3.  Mahayana Buddhism largely rejects ritualistic practices and emphasizes individual meditation as the sole path to enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, having achieved Buddhahood, choose to remain in the world to guide and assist others on the path to enlightenment, delaying their own final Nirvana until all beings are liberated. This selfless act of compassion is a key tenet of Mahayana philosophy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which focuses on the historical Buddha as a model of self-realization, Mahayana Buddhism often depicts the Buddha as a transcendent, divine being.  This leads to the development of elaborate rituals, iconography, and devotional practices centered around the worship of Buddha and other Bodhisattvas.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While individual meditation is important in Mahayana Buddhism, it does not reject ritualistic practices.  In fact, Mahayana Buddhism incorporates a wide range of rituals, ceremonies, and devotional practices aimed at assisting individuals on their spiritual journey and fostering collective merit.  The emphasis on the divine Buddha and Bodhisattvas naturally leads to ritualistic forms of worship.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Akbarnama, a lavishly illustrated manuscript commissioned by Akbar, is a significant example of Mughal artistic patronage. It documents the emperor's reign, providing valuable insights into the court's life, culture, and administrative practices. The detailed illustrations are a testament to the high level of artistic skill during Akbar's time.

Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir's personal interest in art led to a noticeable stylistic shift in Mughal painting.  While Akbar's reign saw grand narratives and historical scenes, Jahangir's patronage emphasized realistic portraiture, detailed botanical studies, and precise depictions of animals.  This focus on naturalism and realism is a defining characteristic of Jahangir-era art.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, is an architectural masterpiece representing the pinnacle of Mughal architectural achievements.  Its design incorporates elements of Persian, Indian, and Islamic architectural traditions, showcasing a unique blend of styles that reflects the cosmopolitan nature of the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core principle of the Bhakti movement was the emphasis on bhakti (devotion) as the path to moksha (liberation). This emphasis on personal devotion transcended traditional caste hierarchies, allowing individuals from all social backgrounds to access divine grace.  The movement's inclusive nature challenged the rigid social structures of the time.

Statement 2 is also correct. Many Bhakti saints, including Kabir and Mirabai, composed their devotional poetry in vernacular languages like Hindi and Braj Bhasha. This made their teachings accessible to the common people, who did not necessarily understand Sanskrit, the language of the elite and religious texts. Their use of simple language and relatable imagery further enhanced their message's reach and impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Bhakti movement had prominent Vaishnava saints (those devoted to Vishnu), it encompassed a wide range of devotional traditions, including those centered on Shiva, Shakti, and other deities.  The movement's diversity is reflected in the variety of deities and devotional practices embraced by its different saints and followers.  Restricting the movement solely to Vishnu worship is an inaccurate simplification.

2.  Evidence suggests the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during the Harappan period.
3.  The Harappans primarily worshipped a single, male deity, neglecting female deities in their religious practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Harappan Civilization is renowned for its advanced urban planning, as demonstrated by the meticulously planned streets, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes found in major cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. This urban organization reflects a high level of societal organization and engineering prowess.  However, there is no substantial archaeological evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in Harappan warfare. While horse bones have been found at some sites, their significance in military applications remains debated among archaeologists.  Furthermore, the statement that the Harappans worshipped only a single male deity is inaccurate. Archaeological findings reveal evidence of the worship of both male and female deities, indicating a more complex religious system than a monotheistic one.  The presence of mother goddess figurines and other iconography suggests a prominent role for female divinities in Harappan religion.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, dedicate themselves to helping sentient beings achieve enlightenment.  This selfless act of compassion is central to Mahayana philosophy and practice.  Contrary to statement 2, Mahayana Buddhism does incorporate image worship and rituals as important aspects of its practice. The visual representation of the Buddha and other deities plays a significant role in devotional practices, and various rituals and ceremonies are performed in temples and monasteries.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the Mahayana view of the Buddha. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which emphasizes the Buddha as a historical figure, Mahayana Buddhism often portrays the Buddha as a divine being, worthy of veneration and worship. This deification of the Buddha is a key distinguishing feature of Mahayana.

(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara architectural style is distinctive, with Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) being a notable feature in many of its temple complexes. These structures were often elaborately decorated and served as important spaces within the temple precinct.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did have interactions with Jain communities, the empire primarily patronized Hindu religious institutions.  Numerous grand Hindu temples were constructed throughout the empire, showcasing the rulers' devotion to Hinduism. The extensive ruins of Hampi, located in Karnataka, represent the remains of the old capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. This ancient city was a significant centre of power and culture, and its architectural remnants provide valuable insights into the empire's history and artistic achievements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

During Jahangir's reign, there was a notable shift in Mughal artistic patronage. While illustrated manuscripts remained important, there was a growing emphasis on individual portraits, often featuring detailed depictions of the emperor, his family, and court officials.  Album paintings, collections of individual works, also gained prominence. Tansen, a legendary musician during Akbar's reign, was known for his exceptional musical talent and contributions to the development of Hindustani classical music. While he didn't invent numerous ragas, he was a master performer and composer who significantly enriched the existing repertoire. Statement 3 is incorrect. Akbar’s religious policy was characterized by remarkable religious tolerance and syncretism. He engaged in dialogues with scholars from various religious backgrounds and even promoted a new religion, Din-i Ilahi, which aimed to synthesize elements from different faiths.  This policy, although controversial, demonstrated Akbar’s commitment to religious harmony rather than persecution.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti movement, characterized by intense devotion and the direct experience of God, originated in South India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, between the 6th and 10th centuries. It later spread to North India, influencing religious and social life across the subcontinent.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Ramananda, a key figure in the Bhakti movement's Northern expansion, significantly utilized vernacular languages like Hindi to convey his teachings to a wider audience. This accessibility contributed to the movement's broader reach and impact.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Alvars were a group of 12 Vaishnava poet-saints who lived in South India and dedicated their works to Lord Vishnu and his avatar Krishna.  The Nayanmars, on the other hand, were the poet-saints devoted to Lord Shiva.

**Explanation:**

Amir Khusrau, a prolific figure in the Indo-Persian cultural landscape, made significant contributions to music and literature. While the exact origin of the sitar is debated, he is credited with innovations and developments in musical instruments.  Statement 2 is incorrect. A defining characteristic of Sufi traditions is their emphasis on egalitarianism and the transcendence of social barriers, including caste. Sufi saints actively challenged social hierarchies and embraced people from all backgrounds.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct and geographically dispersed styles of Indian temple architecture. Each style has its unique features in terms of shikhara (tower) design, ornamentation, and overall layout.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple, a significant example of Kalinga architecture, is located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.  The Khajuraho temples, renowned for their intricate sculptures and architectural grandeur, were primarily constructed during the reign of the Chandela dynasty. This dynasty's patronage played a crucial role in the development of this remarkable temple complex in Madhya Pradesh.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nicolo de Conti, an Italian traveler, visited India in the 15th century and left behind a valuable account of his travels.  In his description, he compared the Telugu language to Italian, highlighting its perceived elegance and sophistication.  Ibn Battuta, in his Rihla, focuses on various aspects of India's social, political, and religious life during his travels in the 14th century, but he does not provide extensive details on diamond mines. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's writings are more renowned for their detailed descriptions of India's diamond mines. Megasthenes' Indica, though much of the original text is lost, offers valuable insights into the Mauryan Empire's social and political organization, religious practices, and daily life. Although incomplete, it remains a vital source for understanding the Mauryan period.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Alauddin Khilji, a prominent ruler of the Khilji dynasty, established Siri as the second city of Delhi.  This city, although now in ruins, played a significant role in the history of Delhi.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq, not Firoz Shah Tughlaq, constructed Jahanpanah, another city within the Delhi region. Sher Shah Suri, a significant Afghan ruler, built Shergarh, which is now known as Purana Qila. This fort, with its historical importance, is a prominent landmark in Delhi.

**Explanation:**

The Mughal style of painting, characterized by its realism, detail, and use of vibrant colors, exerted a profound influence on the development of Rajput painting.  The styles intermingled, with Rajput artists incorporating Mughal techniques and aesthetics into their own works.  The Mughal emperors were not primarily patrons of sculpture; instead, they were known for their patronage of painting and other art forms. Akbar's reign marked a golden age for Mughal painting.  His court attracted talented artists, and his patronage spurred the creation of numerous illustrated manuscripts, including the Akbarnama, a detailed biography of his life and reign.  These manuscripts are exemplary of the high artistic standards achieved during his rule.

The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, governs the GI tag system in India.  This act specifically applies to goods and does not extend to services. The GI tag offers protection for the products' unique qualities and reputation associated with their geographical origin.  A GI registration is valid for 10 years, and it can be renewed for subsequent 10-year periods, ensuring continued protection for the registered products.  As of a certain point in time, Karnataka held the distinction of having the highest number of GI-tagged products in India, reflecting the state's diverse agricultural and handicraft traditions.  Note that this number may change over time as new products receive GI status.

**1. With reference to the architectural impact of Babur's arrival in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology in India's military.
2. The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture can be directly attributed to Babur's influence.
3. Babur established the Timurid dynasty in India, significantly shaping its political and architectural landscape.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Babur's arrival did bring more advanced gunpowder weaponry to India, gunpowder technology was already present in India before his arrival, albeit in a less developed form.  His military utilized gunpowder effectively, but it wasn't a completely novel introduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The arch and dome were already established architectural features in India long before Babur's arrival.  Examples exist in pre-Mughal structures.  While the Mughals refined and popularized certain styles, attributing the introduction of these elements solely to Babur is inaccurate.  The architectural styles that Babur brought were primarily influenced by Timurid and Persian architecture, which itself drew from diverse sources.

Statement 3 is correct. Babur's victory at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire, thereby establishing the Timurid dynasty in India.  This dynasty had a profound impact on Indian architecture, politics, and culture.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vijayanagara architecture displays a strong Dravidian influence, it also incorporated elements from other styles, demonstrating a synthesis of various architectural traditions.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

His actions were more focused on fostering a syncretic culture and intellectual discussions rather than establishing a formal, structured educational system in the modern sense.

Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir, a patron of the arts himself, actively encouraged a shift in artistic production, favoring individual portraits and album-style collections over large-scale illustrated manuscripts.  This reflects a change in aesthetic preferences within the Mughal court.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir's philosophy was strongly critical of orthodox religious practices and the rigid caste system prevalent in society. His teachings promoted a more egalitarian and inclusive spiritual path, transcending traditional boundaries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Ramananda, despite his emphasis on devotion to Rama, belonged to the Saguna school, which emphasizes God with attributes.  While he used vernacular languages to spread his message, attributing the *promotion* of Hindi to him solely is an overstatement, as other saints also contributed to the use of vernaculars.  Moreover, Kabir, a disciple of Ramananda, is more closely associated with the Nirguna school.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe key tenets of Mahayana Buddhism.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct.  The Kalyana mandapa was indeed a significant architectural feature of Vijayanagara temples, serving as a space for weddings and other ceremonies.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Nimbarka predates Akbar by several centuries. Kabir's philosophy, while influenced by Sufism, did not directly involve Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, who came much later.  The Bhakti movement encompassed both Saguna (with form) and Nirguna (without form) schools of thought, not exclusively focusing on Nirguna Brahman.  It celebrated diverse paths to devotion and did not rigidly adhere to a single theological framework. The movement's strength lay in its inclusiveness and adaptability to various interpretations of the divine.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. Jahangir's reign saw a shift in Mughal artistic patronage, with a greater focus on individual portraits and album paintings, showcasing his personal interest in art and his role as a patron of artists. The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan, not Akbar, to commemorate his wife Mumtaz Mahal.  Mian Tansen received his title "Mian" from Akbar, not Humayun. The other statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the commissioning of the Taj Mahal and the bestowal of the title "Mian" upon Tansen.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Chishti order, with its emphasis on tolerance and peaceful interaction with other faiths, significantly impacted India's religious landscape. The Naqshbandi order, indeed founded by Bahauddin Naqshband Bukhari, gained considerable influence during Akbar's reign. Statement 2 is an oversimplification; while some Suhrawardi adherents emphasized asceticism, the order's practices were more diverse and not solely focused on strict adherence to Islamic law.  The statement presents a limited and inaccurate view of the Suhrawardi order's practices.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Ajanta caves are indeed renowned for their Gupta-period paintings, Bagh caves also contain examples, making them two of the earliest surviving examples.  However, the statement implies *only* these two locations, which isn't entirely accurate as other sites might hold less-known examples.  Statement 2 is correct. Ajanta's focus on Buddhist narratives is well-established, contrasting with Bagh's more diverse religious representation. Statement 3 is incorrect. While both sites utilize natural pigments, the primary technique in Ajanta is fresco painting, but Bagh also employs other techniques such as tempera.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are partially correct, making (a) the closest option.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring knowledge of both sites' artistic styles and religious themes. The inclusion of "extensively" in statement 3 acts as a distractor, as while natural pigments were used, it wasn't the sole technique in Bagh.

All three statements accurately describe the key characteristics of the three major styles of ancient Indian temple architecture.  The Nagara style's curvilinear shikhara is a defining feature of North Indian temples. The Dravida style's pyramidal form is equally distinct in South India. The Vesara style's hybrid nature, resulting from the fusion of Nagara and Dravida elements in the Deccan region, is also well-documented.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding, requiring knowledge of the regional distribution and stylistic features of these architectural styles.  There are no plausible distractors here as all three statements are generally accepted facts in art history.

These moods, or 'Rasas', are integral to the emotional impact of the music. "Tala," on the other hand, refers to rhythmic cycles or patterns that provide the temporal structure for musical compositions.  These rhythmic cycles are complex and vary in length and complexity, providing a framework for the melodic development of the raga. The "svara" system comprises a seven-note scale (saptak) that serves as the foundation for constructing melodies within a raga.  These seven notes, along with their variations (vikrit swaras), provide the building blocks for creating the diverse range of melodies found in Indian classical music.  The understanding of these three elements – raga, tala, and svara – is crucial for appreciating the intricacies of Indian classical music.

This style often features intricate carvings and decorative elements.  The Dravida style, prevalent in South India, is characterized by its towering gopurams (gateways) and pyramidal vimana (shrines).  These structures are usually massive and imposing, often adorned with sculptures and carvings. The Vesara style, found in the Deccan region, is a hybrid style, incorporating elements from both Nagara and Dravida styles.  This fusion creates a unique architectural vocabulary, combining features of both northern and southern traditions.  The Vesara style often exhibits a blend of curvilinear and pyramidal forms, demonstrating the interplay of architectural influences across different regions of India.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect important historical events in the development of Buddhism in India. The First Buddhist Council, held soon after the death of the Buddha at Rajgriha (modern-day Rajgir), was indeed convened to standardize and preserve the Buddha's teachings. This council played a crucial role in establishing the basic tenets of Buddhism. The Second Buddhist Council, held at Vaishali, did lead to a significant schism within the Buddhist Sangha, resulting in the emergence of different schools of thought and interpretations of Buddhist doctrine.  This division marked a turning point in the evolution of Buddhism. The Third Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka, further contributed to the standardization of Buddhist scriptures and played a crucial role in the spread of Buddhism beyond India, particularly to Sri Lanka through the missionary efforts of Mahinda, Ashoka's son.  These councils were pivotal in shaping the course of Buddhism throughout history.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While Babur did introduce gunpowder tactics more effectively than previous rulers, gunpowder itself was not entirely new to India.  The statement regarding the Timurid architectural style is largely correct. Babur, a Timurid prince, brought elements of Central Asian architecture, including the use of arches and domes, although the arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before his arrival.  However, Babur's architectural innovations significantly influenced subsequent Mughal architecture.  The third statement is incorrect; the Mughal dynasty's establishment was a gradual process that unfolded over several generations, not solely through Babur's initial conquests.  He established the foundations, but his successors consolidated and expanded the empire.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is famously found at Ajanta Caves, not Ellora.  A massive Varaha (boar incarnation of Vishnu) sculpture does exist at Udayagiri Caves, not Mount Abu.  Arjuna's Penance is a rock-cut relief at Mahabalipuram, not Ajanta. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a location of a specific sculpture. The other statements incorrectly associate sculptures with their locations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ibadat Khana was not solely a royal mosque, nor was it primarily used for Akbar's private devotions.  Its main purpose was to facilitate religious debates and discussions between scholars of different faiths.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately describes the Ibadat Khana's function during Akbar's reign.  The other options present inaccurate or incomplete descriptions of its purpose.

**Explanation:**

The Virupaksha Temple is actually located in Hampi. The Vijaya-Vittala Temple is situated in Hampi, not Belur. The Allahabad pillar inscription is indeed associated with Samudragupta. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other statements incorrectly identify the locations of significant temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gomateshwara statue correctly represents the last Tirthankara.  The statement about the largest Buddhist monastery is incorrect; its location is debated, but it's not definitively in Arunachal Pradesh.  The Hoysaleswara Temple is dedicated to Shiva, not Vishnu. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Statements 2 and 3 contain factual errors regarding the location and deity of significant sites.

**Explanation:**

The major concentration of Hoysala monuments is in Halebid and Belur, Karnataka.  Hampi and Hospet are associated with Vijayanagara architecture. Mysore and Bangalore have temples from various periods, but not a primary concentration of Hoysala structures. Therefore, only statement 2 correctly identifies the location of a significant number of Hoysala monuments. The other statements are geographically inaccurate.

**Explanation:**

The Lingaraja Temple is situated in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.  Bijapur is known for its Indo-Islamic architecture. The Lingaraja Temple is dedicated to Shiva, not Vishnu. Therefore, only statement 2 correctly identifies the temple's location. The other statements are factually incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cows were indeed a common motif in Harappan art.  Elephants were also depicted. Tigers are less frequently found compared to other animals.

**Explanation:**

The Painted Grey Ware is associated with the Iron Age in India, not the Harappan Civilization.  The Kushanas are correctly linked to the Gandhara School of Art. Ajanta Paintings are primarily associated with the Gupta and Vakataka periods, not the Mughals. Therefore, only statement 2 forms a correct association between an art style and a historical period. The other statements are historically inaccurate.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Raja Ravi Varma is a pivotal figure in the development of modern Indian art.  "Ravana Kidnapping Sita & Killing Jatayu" is indeed one of his well-known paintings.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Abanindranath Tagore was indeed a central figure in the Bengal School of Art. Rabindranath Tagore's influence, although indirect, was important in the school's development through his broader cultural impact.  However, Satyendranath Tagore's direct involvement with the Bengal School of Art is not historically prominent. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the individuals' association with the Bengal School.

1. Pattachitra painting is primarily associated with Jharkhand.
2. Paitkar painting is primarily associated with Odisha.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana Buddhism does feature the deification of the Buddha.  The path of Bodhisattvas is central to its teachings.  However, it does *not* reject image worship and rituals; these are significant aspects of Mahayana practice. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct. Statement 3 misrepresents a core element of Mahayana Buddhism.


**32. With reference to the construction of Kalyana Mandapas, consider the following statements:**

1. Kalyana Mandapas were a prominent feature in Chalukya temple architecture.
2. Kalyana Mandapas were a notable feature in Vijayanagara temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) appeared in various architectural styles, their prominence is particularly associated with Vijayanagara temples.  They were not primarily used for royal audiences; their function was related to marriage ceremonies and celebrations. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the context and use of Kalyana Mandapas.

1. Saint Nimbarka was a contemporary of Akbar.
2. Saint Kabir was greatly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Saint Nimbarka predates Akbar by several centuries.  Saint Kabir's teachings were not directly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, who came later.  Saint Kabir's emphasis on the unity of God is a core tenet of his philosophy. Therefore, only statement 3 correctly describes a key aspect of Saint Kabir's teachings. The other statements contain chronological and attributional errors.


**34. With reference to Mian Tansen, consider the following statements:**

1. Tansen was a contemporary of Aurangzeb.
2. Tansen composed dhrupads on Hindu gods and goddesses.
3. Tansen invented several new ragas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tansen served in Akbar's court, not Aurangzeb's.  He is known for composing dhrupads on Hindu deities.  While he is credited with popularizing and refining existing ragas, the invention of entirely new ragas is less definitively attributed to him.  Therefore, only statement 2 is historically accurate.


**35. With reference to Mughal emperors and their artistic patronage, consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun shifted the emphasis from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits.
2. Akbar heavily patronized the creation of illustrated manuscripts.
3. Jahangir's reign saw a significant shift towards individual portraits and album art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Humayun's artistic patronage was less focused on individual portraits and more on the continuation of established manuscript traditions.  Akbar's reign was indeed a golden age for illustrated manuscripts. Jahangir's preference for individual portraits and album art is well-documented. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the artistic trends under these Mughal emperors.



**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest Harappan site, Rakhigarhi, yielded evidence of granaries, a cemetery, drainage systems, and terracotta bricks, suggesting a well-organized urban center.
2.  Chanhudaro, unlike other Harappan cities, lacked a citadel, indicating a potentially different social structure or urban planning model.
3.  Lothal, situated on the Gujarat coast, featured a sophisticated dockyard, indicating a significant role in maritime trade and exchange networks connecting it to Mesopotamia and Sumeria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Harappan Civilization. Rakhigarhi's extensive archaeological findings confirm its status as the largest known settlement, showcasing advanced urban planning and infrastructure. Chanhudaro's unique absence of a citadel is a well-documented feature, contrasting with the typical layout of other Harappan cities and prompting ongoing scholarly debate about its societal organization. Lothal's dockyard is strong evidence of its prominence in maritime trade, connecting the civilization to wider networks in the ancient world.  The absence of a citadel at Chanhudaro and the presence of a dockyard at Lothal are significant details that distinguish these sites and offer valuable insights into the complexity and diversity within the Harappan urban landscape. The statement about Rakhigarhi is also supported by extensive archaeological evidence. These features highlight the advanced urban planning, sophisticated engineering, and extensive trade networks of the Harappan civilization. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to capture the complete picture presented by the archaeological evidence.


**2. With reference to Mauryan art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashokan pillars, averaging 40 feet in height, were typically crafted from Chunar sandstone, featuring a monolithic shaft and a capital often shaped like a lotus or bell.
2.  The national emblem of India is derived from the abacus and animal figures of the Sarnath pillar, depicting a lion, elephant, bull, and horse, representing the four cardinal directions.
3. The Barabar and Nagarjuni caves in Bihar, dating back to the 3rd century BC, exemplify early rock-cut cave architecture, initially used by Ajivikas and later adopted by Buddhist and Jain monks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate descriptions of Mauryan art and architecture. The Ashokan pillars, renowned for their craftsmanship and inscriptions, are meticulously described in statement 1, highlighting their material, dimensions, and characteristic features. Statement 2 correctly identifies the source of India's national emblem, emphasizing its symbolic representation of the four directions and its connection to Buddhist cosmology. Statement 3 accurately describes the Barabar and Nagarjuni caves, their age, and their historical significance as early examples of rock-cut architecture used by various religious groups. These caves represent an important stage in the development of rock-cut architecture in India, showcasing the sophisticated craftsmanship and engineering skills of the Mauryan period. The adoption of these caves by different religious groups reflects the religious tolerance and diversity of the Mauryan era.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to encompass the full scope of Mauryan artistic and architectural achievements.


**3. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism features the deification of the Buddha, elevating him to a divine status and object of worship.
2. The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is central to Mahayana beliefs.
3.  Image worship and elaborate rituals, including ceremonies and offerings, played a significant role in Mahayana Buddhist practice, unlike the earlier Hinayana tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key characteristics of Mahayana Buddhism. The deification of the Buddha is a core tenet, differentiating it from earlier forms of Buddhism. The Bodhisattva ideal is a central concept, emphasizing compassion and the pursuit of enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. The emphasis on image worship and elaborate rituals marks a significant departure from the earlier, more austere practices of Theravada Buddhism.  The development of Mahayana Buddhism saw a shift towards a more devotional and ritualistic form of practice, with the emphasis on the worship of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.  This was accompanied by the creation of elaborate temples and monasteries, adorned with statues and other religious objects. The other options are therefore incomplete representations of Mahayana Buddhism.


**4. With reference to Vijayanagara temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The construction of Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temples, often found within larger temple complexes.
2. Vijayanagara temples incorporated elements of Dravidian architectural style, characterized by towering gopurams (gateway towers) and intricate carvings.
3.  The Vittala Temple at Hampi, with its famous stone chariot and musical pillars, exemplifies the grandeur and artistic sophistication of Vijayanagara temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe significant aspects of Vijayanagara temple architecture.  The Kalyana mandapas are a well-documented feature, reflecting the importance of rituals and ceremonies within the temple complex. The Dravidian influence is evident in many Vijayanagara temples, showcasing the continuity and adaptation of architectural styles. The Vittala Temple at Hampi stands as a prime example of the artistic achievements of the Vijayanagara period, combining architectural grandeur with intricate craftsmanship.  The Vijayanagara style represents a unique blend of various architectural traditions, incorporating elements of Dravidian, Hoysala, and other regional styles. The Vittala Temple is a particularly prominent example, showcasing the sophisticated engineering and artistic skills of the Vijayanagara architects and sculptors.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) provide incomplete descriptions of Vijayanagara temple architecture.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbark, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, is considered a contemporary of Akbar, significantly influencing the religious climate of the Mughal court.
2. Saint Kabir, known for his syncretic views blending Hindu and Islamic traditions, was deeply influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure of the Naqshbandi Sufi order.
3.  The Bhakti movement fostered the use of vernacular languages in religious literature, making spiritual teachings accessible to a wider audience beyond the Sanskrit-literate elite.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately reflects a key aspect of the Bhakti movement. While statements 1 and 2 contain names of important figures, the chronological and relational aspects are incorrect.  Nimbarka predates Akbar by several centuries, and Kabir's teachings predate Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  However, the Bhakti movement's crucial contribution was in promoting the use of vernacular languages (like Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, etc.) to disseminate religious ideas and make them accessible to a broader population, thus undermining the dominance of Sanskrit.  This use of vernacular languages is a key factor that distinguishes the Bhakti movement from the earlier religious traditions that primarily used Sanskrit. The other options are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracies in their historical claims.


**6. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar's reign saw a significant shift in Mughal artistic patronage, from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album paintings.
2.  Jahangir, himself a keen painter, is known for his patronage of individual portraiture, emphasizing realism and detailed representation of flora and fauna.
3.  The Hamzanama, a profusely illustrated manuscript commissioned during Akbar's reign, depicts the adventures of the mythical Persian hero Amir Hamza.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Akbar did patronize the arts extensively, the primary shift towards individual portraits and albums is more accurately associated with Jahangir. Akbar's reign is primarily known for its illustrated manuscripts. Jahangir's personal interest in painting and his emphasis on realism and detail in portraiture are well-documented. The Hamzanama, a monumental work of illustrated manuscripts, was indeed commissioned during Akbar's reign. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct, while statement 1 is partially incorrect in its attribution of the shift to Akbar's reign.  The evolution of Mughal painting styles reflects the changing tastes and preferences of the emperors.  Akbar's patronage led to the development of a unique style characterized by its narrative focus and detailed depictions of courtly life. Jahangir's reign saw a greater emphasis on realism and individual portraiture, reflecting his personal interest in art. The other options are therefore incorrect because of their inaccurate association of the stylistic shifts in Mughal painting.


**7. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Badami caves are considered the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India, showcasing early examples of cave temples and monasteries.
2. The Barabar caves, originally constructed for Ajivikas during the Mauryan period, are renowned for their highly polished interior walls and decorative gateways.
3.  The Ellora caves represent a unique blend of architectural styles, featuring cave temples dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, reflecting religious syncretism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Barabar caves predate the Badami caves.  Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The Barabar caves, with their distinctive polished interiors and architectural features, are a significant example of early rock-cut architecture in India.  The Ellora caves, known for their diverse religious representation, showcase the remarkable blend of architectural styles and religious tolerance during a specific period in Indian history.  The Barabar caves represent an early example of rock-cut architecture in India, dating back to the Mauryan period. The high level of craftsmanship and the use of sophisticated techniques demonstrate the advanced engineering and artistic skills of the time.  The Ellora caves, on the other hand, represent a later period and showcase a remarkable blend of architectural styles and religious traditions. The other options are therefore partially or wholly incorrect.


**8. With reference to Indian painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school of painting is known for its distinctive use of gold coating and its major patronage from the Maratha rulers.
2. The Bengal School of Art, spearheaded by Abanindranath Tagore, championed a revival of Indian artistic traditions, rejecting Western influences.
3. Raja Ravi Varma, a pioneer of modern Indian art, is known for his realistic depictions of Hindu deities and mythological scenes, often using oil painting techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Thanjavur school did receive Maratha patronage, its association with gold coating is a simplification.  The Bengal School's emphasis on a revival of Indian artistic traditions and the rejection of Western influences is accurate. Raja Ravi Varma's contribution to modern Indian art and his realistic style are also well-established facts.  The Thanjavur painting style is indeed associated with the use of gold leaf, but the claim about major patronage from the Marathas requires more nuance.  The style developed over a period of time and received patronage from various rulers. The Bengal school of art is well known for its distinctive style and nationalist themes, with Abanindranath Tagore being a key figure.  Raja Ravi Varma is rightly considered a pioneer of modern Indian art, known for his realistic depictions of Hindu mythology. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are only partially correct.


**9. With reference to Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. Indo-Greek coins often featured inscriptions in both Sanskrit and Greek, reflecting the cultural fusion of the period.
2. Kanishka, a Kushan emperor, primarily issued lead coins, which were relatively common during his reign.
3.  The Ujjain symbol, a distinctive feature on Satavahana coins, indicates the significance of Ujjain as a major political and economic center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate, reflecting the bilingual nature of Indo-Greek coinage. Statement 2 is incorrect; Kanishka issued a variety of coins in different metals. Statement 3 is correct; the Ujjain symbol is a significant marker on Satavahana coinage. The Indo-Greek coins provide valuable insights into the cultural exchange and interaction between Indian and Greek civilizations. The use of both Sanskrit and Greek inscriptions reflects the fusion of cultural influences during this period. The Satavahana coins, with their distinctive Ujjain symbol, indicate the importance of Ujjain as a major political and economic center during the Satavahana period. The other options are therefore incorrect due to factual inaccuracies.

Tamralipti's prominence as a Mauryan port and its connection to trade routes to Southeast Asia and China are also historical facts.  These ports played crucial roles in facilitating trade and cultural exchange between India and other parts of the world. The extensive trade networks of ancient India are well documented, and these ports served as key hubs for the exchange of goods and ideas. The other options are therefore incomplete and do not fully represent the historical significance of these ports.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, including a grid pattern of roads and advanced drainage systems.
2.  The major Harappan sites of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa are located in present-day India.
3.  Evidence suggests the Harappans practiced both burial and cremation of the dead.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological evidence from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveals a remarkably well-planned urban layout with grid-like street patterns, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. This demonstrates advanced urban planning and engineering capabilities for its time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While significant Harappan sites were discovered in what is now Pakistan (e.g., Mohenjo-daro and Harappa), the civilization extended across a vast area encompassing parts of present-day India as well.  Many important sites are located within India.

Statement 3 is correct.  Archaeological findings at various Harappan sites show evidence of both burial and cremation practices. The methods varied across locations and possibly reflected social or religious differences within the civilization.  The presence of both practices complicates a simple interpretation of their beliefs and rituals.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve nirvana.
2. The Mahayana tradition is characterized by a strict adherence to monastic rules and a rejection of lay participation in religious practice.
3.  Image worship and elaborate rituals are central features of Mahayana Buddhist practice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to delay their own entry into Nirvana to guide others toward enlightenment. This emphasis on compassion and altruism distinguishes Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While monasticism exists within Mahayana Buddhism, it actively incorporates lay practitioners into its religious community. Lay people play a vital role in supporting monasteries and participating in religious activities.  The emphasis on accessibility and widespread participation is a key difference between Mahayana and some other Buddhist traditions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Unlike some other Buddhist traditions that emphasize meditation and personal spiritual practice, Mahayana Buddhism often involves elaborate rituals, devotional practices, and the veneration of Buddha images and other sacred objects.  This visual aspect of worship is a key characteristic of Mahayana.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

(b) 1 and 2 only

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kalyana Mandapas, elaborate wedding pavilions within temple complexes, are a unique architectural feature strongly associated with the Vijayanagara style.  These structures highlight the importance of royal patronage and celebratory rituals within the religious context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Vijayanagara style drew heavily from Dravidian traditions, it wasn't exclusively limited to that style. The empire's architecture shows a synthesis of various influences, including elements from other regional styles.  This eclectic approach reflects the empire's vast geographical extent and cultural diversity.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The artistic and architectural achievements of the Vijayanagara empire were not developed in isolation.  They reflect a blend of regional, indigenous, and external influences, resulting in a unique synthesis of styles and artistic expressions.  The exchange of ideas and artistic practices across different regions is crucial to understanding the empire's cultural development.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

These compilations represent different branches or traditions within the larger body of Kabir's work.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kabir's philosophy was profoundly anti-ritualistic. He stressed the importance of direct, personal experience of God, rejecting the formalism and hierarchy of established religious institutions, both Hindu and Muslim.  His emphasis on inner spiritual experience and direct connection with the divine is a central theme in his work.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Kabir's teachings were remarkably syncretic, drawing on elements from both Hinduism and Islam. He transcended the boundaries of conventional religious dogma, advocating for a unified vision of the divine that encompassed both traditions.  His rejection of sectarianism and his inclusive approach made his message accessible to a wide range of people.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire's artistic patronage, consider the following statements:**

3.  Mughal art and architecture were exclusively patronized by the imperial court, with no significant contributions from regional artists or patrons.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, reflecting a synthesis of Persian and Indian artistic styles. Jahangir, known for his own artistic inclinations, further developed this tradition, but also placed greater emphasis on individual portraits and the creation of albums (muraqqas) containing a collection of paintings.  This shift reflects changing aesthetic preferences within the imperial court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mughal painting was deeply influenced by Persian artistic traditions, it also incorporated significant elements from Indian styles and techniques.  The fusion of these diverse influences resulted in a unique and distinctive Mughal artistic style that incorporated elements of both cultures.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the imperial court was the primary patron of Mughal art and architecture, regional artists and patrons also made significant contributions. The Mughal artistic style wasn't confined to the imperial court; it spread across various regions, influencing regional artistic styles and fostering a vibrant exchange of artistic ideas.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

It offers a broader perspective on the social, economic, and political life of ancient Tamil society, encompassing various regions and social groups beyond the Pandya kingdom.  The scope extends beyond a single dynasty's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The dating of the Sangam period is not precise.  While scholars generally place the period during which the bulk of the literature was composed sometime between 300 BC and 300 AD, the exact timeframe and the chronological order of the three Sangams remain subjects of scholarly debate and interpretation.  The dating is based on indirect evidence and remains uncertain.

Statement 3 is correct. Sangam literature provides a wealth of information about various aspects of ancient Tamil society.  It offers insights into social structures, economic activities, religious beliefs, and cultural practices, providing valuable primary source material for understanding ancient Tamil civilization.  This rich cultural portrayal is a significant contribution to understanding the past.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The Upanishads are philosophical treatises that explore profound metaphysical concepts such as Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (individual self), and their relationship.  They are foundational texts for Vedanta philosophy.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Brahmanas are prose texts that explain and interpret the Vedic rituals in great detail.  They provide elaborate descriptions of sacrificial rites, their symbolic meanings, and their significance within the Vedic worldview.

3.  The Hitopadesha, written by Narayan Pandit, is a work of classical Sanskrit drama.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panini's Ashtadhyayi is a foundational text on Sanskrit grammar, outlining its complex rules and structure.  It's a crucial work for understanding the linguistic framework of classical Sanskrit literature.

The Mahabharata and Ramayana, while possessing religious significance, are foundational works that heavily influenced the development of later Sanskrit epic poetry (Kavya) and classical drama (Nataka).  Their narrative structures and poetic styles served as models for subsequent writers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Hitopadesha is a collection of animal fables and didactic stories, aiming to impart moral wisdom. It's not a classical Sanskrit drama; that genre includes works like those of Kālidāsa and Bhāsa.  The categorization of Hitopadesha falls under the genre of  Niti literature (literature of political and ethical guidance).


**2. With reference to Sanskrit Drama, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kālidāsa's *Abhijnanashakuntalam* is a political drama focusing on the rise of Chandragupta Maurya.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating subtle distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding early Buddhist schools:**

1. The Mahasamghika school, one of the earliest branches of Buddhism, included sub-sects like the Gokulika and the Prajnaptivada.
2. The Sthavira Nikaya, another early Buddhist school, comprised sub-sects such as the Sarvastivada and the Dharmaguptaka, but not the Caitika.
3. The Hemavatika sect was a prominent sub-sect within the Mahasamghika school, known for its unique interpretations of Buddhist doctrine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mahasamghika school was indeed one of the earliest branches of Buddhism, and it did encompass sub-sects like the Gokulika and Prajnaptivada.  These sub-sects represented variations in doctrinal interpretations and monastic practices within the broader Mahasamghika framework.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sthavira Nikaya, another early school, included important sub-sects such as the Sarvastivada and Dharmaguptaka.  However, the Caitika sect belonged to the Mahasamghika school, not the Sthavira Nikaya. This distinction highlights the diverse interpretations and evolving nature of early Buddhism.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Hemavatika sect existed within early Buddhism, it is not definitively linked to the Mahasamghika school.  The affiliations and precise doctrinal stances of many early Buddhist sects remain subjects of scholarly debate due to fragmented historical records.  Attributing Hemavatika solely to the Mahasamghika school is an oversimplification.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurately reflective of the established historical understanding of early Buddhist schools.


**2. With reference to the Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, rejecting any single absolute truth.
2.  The Digambara sect, one of the two major Jain schools, accepts the concept of women attaining Tirthankarahood, unlike the Svetambara sect.
3.  The Svetambara sect adheres strictly to the five vows of Jainism (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, Brahmacharya), while the Digambara sect modifies the practice of Brahmacharya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the central tenet of Anekantavada in Jain philosophy.  This concept emphasizes the multi-faceted nature of reality and the limitations of any single perspective in capturing its totality.  It underpins the Jain approach to knowledge and ethics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Digambara sect traditionally does *not* accept the possibility of women attaining Tirthankarahood. This is a key difference between the two major Jain schools. The Svetambara sect holds a different view on this matter.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While both sects strive to uphold the five vows, the Digambara school's interpretation and application of Brahmacharya (chastity) may differ subtly from the Svetambara understanding, particularly concerning the degree of asceticism expected. The core principle of the vow remains the same, but its practical application might show some variation.


**3. With reference to Buddhist literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahavamsa, written in Pali, is an epic poem chronicling the history of Sri Lanka, including accounts of the Buddha's visit and the island's kings.
2. The Milinda Panha, a dialogue between King Menander and the Buddhist monk Nagasena, primarily focuses on political strategy and military campaigns.
3.  The Dipavamsa, composed in Sri Lanka, is a prose work detailing the arrival of Buddhism on the island and the establishment of its monastic traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Mahavamsa is indeed a significant Pali-language epic poem that narrates Sri Lanka's history, including the arrival of Buddhism and the reigns of its kings.  It's a crucial source for understanding the development of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Milinda Panha is not about political strategy or military matters.  It's a philosophical dialogue exploring profound Buddhist concepts through a question-and-answer format between King Menander and Nagasena. It's highly valued for its insights into Buddhist philosophy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Dipavamsa is not a prose work; it's a Pali-language chronicle (similar to the Mahavamsa in style).  While it does deal with the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and monastic traditions, classifying it solely as a prose work is an oversimplification.


**4. With reference to the different schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, emphasizes the concept of Sunyata (emptiness), arguing that all phenomena lack inherent self-nature (svabhava).
2.  The Theravada school primarily focuses on individual enlightenment through practices like Samatha (calming the mind) and Vipassana (insight meditation), but not the Bodhisattva path.
3.  The Vajrayana school, often associated with Tantric practices, integrates elements of Brahmanical rituals and Buddhist philosophies, and primarily utilizes Sanskrit texts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Madhyamaka school's central tenet of Sunyata and its implications for understanding reality.  Nagarjuna's contributions were pivotal in shaping Mahayana Buddhist thought.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Theravada school indeed centers on individual enlightenment through practices like Samatha and Vipassana.  The Bodhisattva path, which emphasizes altruistic action for the benefit of all beings, is more characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vajrayana Buddhism does incorporate Tantric practices and integrates some Brahmanical elements, it's not exclusively reliant on Sanskrit texts.  It utilizes various languages depending on its regional expressions.


**5. With reference to Jain literature and its schools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Svetambara sect's canonical literature, known as the Jain Agamas, includes texts written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, but not Sanskrit.
2. The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi, considering them authentic representations of the original Jain teachings.
3.  The Sthanakvasi and Murtipujaka are sub-sects within the Svetambara school, differing primarily in their practices of idol worship.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the majority of the Jain Agamas are in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, some texts within the Svetambara canon are also found in Sanskrit.  The language used varied across time and geographical regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digambara sect *rejects* the authority of the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi, arguing that the original teachings were lost and that the Vallabhi canon is not an accurate reflection of early Jainism.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Sthanakvasi and Murtipujaka are indeed sub-sects within the Svetambara school, with their primary difference lying in their approaches to idol worship: Sthanakvasi avoid idol worship, while Murtipujaka engage in it.


**6. With reference to the teachings and practices of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered suicide by all schools of Jain thought.
2. The Triratna in Jainism consists of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, which are essential for achieving liberation (moksha).
3.  The Digambara sect's monastic rules are generally less stringent than those of the Svetambara sect, particularly regarding material possessions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sallekhana is a controversial practice, it's not universally considered suicide within Jainism.  Jain scholars argue that it's a form of self-discipline undertaken under specific circumstances and with proper guidance, distinguishing it from suicide driven by despair or other negative emotions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Triratna (three jewels) in Jainism – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – are indeed fundamental principles for attaining liberation (moksha) by overcoming karmic bonds.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Digambara sect's monastic rules are generally considered *more* stringent than those of the Svetambara sect, particularly concerning material possessions and asceticism.  Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity, reflecting a higher level of renunciation.


These questions aim to test detailed knowledge and understanding of the nuances within Buddhism and Jainism, going beyond superficial facts.  The distractors are designed to challenge the examinee's understanding and require careful consideration of the subtleties within the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization exhibited a high degree of urban planning, evident in the grid pattern of roads and sophisticated drainage systems in cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Evidence suggests the Harappan Civilization lacked a centralized political structure, with power possibly distributed among regional elites.
3.  The Harappans extensively used bronze technology, but evidence for iron metallurgy is scarce during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkable level of urban planning.  The cities were laid out in a grid pattern with well-planned streets, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, demonstrating advanced engineering and civic administration. This sophisticated urban design is a hallmark of the Harappan civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the exact nature of the Harappan political system is still debated, evidence points towards a degree of centralized control. The uniformity of weights and measures, standardized brick sizes, and the presence of large-scale public works projects suggests some level of centralized authority or at least coordinated effort across different settlements.  The absence of monumental structures like palaces or temples doesn't necessarily negate centralized power; it might reflect a different societal emphasis.

Statement 3 is correct.  Bronze was the primary metal used by the Harappans for tools, weapons, and ornaments.  While some debate exists regarding the extent of copper smelting, the use of bronze technology is well-documented.  The absence of widespread iron tools and weapons during the Harappan period is a key distinguishing feature from later Iron Age cultures. The limited evidence for iron use does not support the claim of extensive iron metallurgy.


**2. With reference to Ashokan inscriptions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Maski inscription is significant for being the first Ashokan edict to explicitly mention "Ashoka" by name, rather than using titles like "Devanampriya."
2.  The Kalinga edicts, inscribed after the Kalinga war, reflect Ashoka's remorse for the violence and his subsequent embrace of Buddhism and non-violence.
3.  All Ashokan inscriptions were written in Prakrit and Brahmi script, demonstrating a unified language and writing system throughout the Mauryan empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Maski inscription is indeed notable for explicitly mentioning "Ashoka," a significant development in our understanding of the Mauryan emperor's identity and the evolution of his inscriptions. Earlier edicts used honorific titles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kalinga edicts are a crucial part of understanding Ashoka's transformation. His remorse over the Kalinga war's brutality is clearly expressed, marking a turning point in his reign and his adoption of a policy of non-violence and Dharma.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many Ashokan inscriptions were written in Prakrit, the script varied.  Some inscriptions used Brahmi, while others employed Kharosthi script, which was used in the northwestern parts of the empire. The use of different scripts reflects the linguistic diversity within the Mauryan empire, not a complete unification.


**3. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the Bodhisattva ideal, where enlightened beings postpone their own nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.
2.  The concept of a deified Buddha, viewed as a divine savior, is central to Mahayana Buddhism, unlike Theravada Buddhism which focuses on the Buddha as a historical figure.
3.  Mahayana Buddhism rejected image worship and rituals, emphasizing meditation and personal spiritual practice as the sole path to enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to delay their own entry into Nirvana to assist others in their path to enlightenment. This emphasis on compassion and helping others is a fundamental difference from the Theravada emphasis on individual liberation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mahayana Buddhism introduced the concept of a deified Buddha, often portrayed as a transcendental being capable of intervening in the world and granting salvation. This differs significantly from Theravada Buddhism, which emphasizes the Buddha's historical existence and teachings as a path to enlightenment through self-effort.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mahayana Buddhism incorporated image worship and elaborate rituals into its practice.  These practices were seen as aids to devotion and spiritual development, not a rejection of the core principles.  While meditation remains important, Mahayana Buddhism didn't solely rely on it.


**4. With reference to Vijayanagara temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana Mandapa (wedding pavilion) was a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temples, often elaborately decorated and a significant part of the temple complex.
2.  Vijayanagara temples primarily followed the Nagara style of architecture, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas and intricate carvings.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kalyana Mandapa, a wedding pavilion, was a prominent feature in many Vijayanagara temples.  These structures were often ornately decorated and served as important spaces within the temple complex, reflecting the significance of rituals and ceremonies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Vijayanagara architecture incorporated elements from various styles, it primarily followed the Dravidian style, characterized by its towering gopurams (gateways) and pyramidal shikharas.  The Nagara style is more associated with North India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Vittala Temple at Hampi is a masterpiece of Vijayanagara architecture.  While predominantly Dravidian in style, it demonstrates a unique synthesis of various architectural influences, including some elements that show the impact of interaction with other styles, rather than direct adoption of Indo-Islamic features.  The temple's intricate carvings and the famous Stone Chariot are iconic representations of Vijayanagara artistic skill.


**5. With reference to the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar initiated a policy of religious tolerance and promoted discussions among scholars of various faiths at the Ibadat Khana.
2.  Jahangir, known for his patronage of the arts, shifted the emphasis in Mughal painting from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.

Statement 2 is also correct; these poems are categorized into various anthologies, each with its specific themes and styles. Statement 3 is incorrect. The historical accuracy of Sangam literature is debated among scholars; while it offers valuable insights, its reliability as a source of definitive historical evidence is not universally accepted.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully accurate.


**9. With reference to classical Indian dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is characterized by its intricate hand gestures (hasta mudras) and expressive facial movements (abhinaya).
2.  Kathakali, originating in Kerala, is a highly stylized dance-drama form known for its elaborate makeup, costumes, and dramatic storytelling.
3.  Odissi, originating in Odisha, is characterized by its graceful movements, emphasis on the tribhanga posture, and its association with Vaishnava devotional traditions.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of these major classical Indian dance forms. Bharatanatyam's distinctive use of hasta mudras and abhinaya is well-known.  Kathakali's highly stylized nature, elaborate makeup, and dramatic storytelling are also defining characteristics. Odissi, with its graceful movements, tribhanga posture, and association with Vaishnavism, is accurately depicted.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**10. With reference to Indian musical traditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hindustani classical music, primarily prevalent in North India, is characterized by its use of ragas and talas, and its emphasis on improvisation.
2.  Carnatic classical music, primarily prevalent in South India, is characterized by its highly structured compositions (kritis) and its emphasis on melodic development.
3.  Both Hindustani and Carnatic classical music traditions have remained isolated from each other, with minimal interaction or influence between them throughout history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the defining characteristics of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music.  Hindustani music's focus on ragas, talas, and improvisation is accurate, as is Carnatic music's emphasis on structured kritis and melodic development. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While distinct, Hindustani and Carnatic traditions have historically interacted and influenced each other, though to varying degrees at different times.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.



**1. With reference to the architectural features of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara style prominently featured the Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) within temple complexes.
2.  The architecture extensively employed the Nagara style of temple construction, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas.
3.  Pietra dura, an inlay technique using precious stones, was a significant decorative element in Vijayanagara structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions, were indeed a notable feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, signifying the importance of royal patronage and the integration of religious and secular life.  Examples like the Kalyana Mandapas within the Vittala Temple complex at Hampi showcase this architectural element.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vijayanagara architecture incorporated various regional styles, it wasn't predominantly Nagara.  The Vijayanagara style developed its own distinct characteristics, blending elements from Dravidian and other regional traditions. The curvilinear shikharas are more associated with the Nagara style prevalent in North India.

Statement 3 is correct. Pietra dura, a technique of inlaying precious and semi-precious stones into the building material, was a significant decorative element in many Vijayanagara structures. This reflects the empire's wealth and its sophisticated artistic sensibilities.  This technique added a unique visual richness to their buildings.


**2. With reference to the  religious practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered suicide by Jain scholars.
2. Pratikraman, a process of daily repentance for sins, involves five types of rituals, including Devasi, Rai Pakhi, Chaumasi, and Samvatsari.
3. The Jain flag's five colours represent Pancha-Parameṣṭhi, a five-fold hierarchy of religious authorities in Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jain scholars do *not* consider Sallekhana to be suicide. It's viewed as a ritualistic practice of self-sacrifice, undertaken under specific conditions and with the intention of achieving spiritual liberation, not as an act of self-harm driven by despair.  The legal battles surrounding Sallekhana highlight the difference in interpretation between secular and religious views.

Statement 2 is correct.  Pratikraman, a daily ritual of self-reflection and repentance, indeed encompasses different levels of confession and atonement. The mention of Devasi, Rai Pakhi, Chaumasi, and Samvatsari accurately reflects the different forms of Pratikraman.

Statement 3 is correct. The five colours of the Jain flag—red, yellow, white, green, and dark blue—do symbolize the Pancha-Parameṣṭhi, representing the five-fold hierarchy of religious leaders within Jainism.  Each colour is associated with a specific rank or role, reflecting the organizational structure of the faith.


**3. With reference to the  Buddhist schools of thought, consider the following statements:**

1. Hinayana Buddhism emphasized individual salvation achieved through self-discipline and meditation, rejecting image worship.
2. Mahayana Buddhism promoted the Bodhisattva path, where individuals strive for enlightenment to benefit all beings and accepts image worship.
3.  Theravada Buddhism, a branch of Hinayana, focuses on the attainment of Nirvana through strict adherence to the Buddha's original teachings and rejects image worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Hinayana Buddhism, often translated as "the lesser vehicle," prioritized individual enlightenment through personal practice, meditation, and strict adherence to the Dharma.  It traditionally avoided idol worship, emphasizing the importance of personal discipline.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahayana Buddhism, or "the greater vehicle," expanded on these concepts, emphasizing the Bodhisattva ideal—individuals who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.  Mahayana traditions generally embrace image worship as a means of devotion and spiritual practice.

Statement 3 is correct. Theravada Buddhism, the oldest surviving branch of Buddhism, is considered a form of Hinayana Buddhism.  It maintains a strong focus on the original teachings of the Buddha and emphasizes personal practice and meditation to achieve Nirvana.  Like traditional Hinayana, it largely avoids idol worship.


**4. With reference to the history of Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samaveda contains the seven notes of the raga Kharaharapriya in descending order.
2. Bharata's Natyashastra, compiled between 200 BC and 200 AD, is the earliest known text to elaborate on Indian musical theory.
3.  Sarangadeva's Sangeet Ratnakara, a 13th-century text, identified and described 22 shrutis (microtones) per octave.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, does indeed contain what scholars interpret as the seven notes of the raga Kharaharapriya in descending order. This demonstrates the early connection between Vedic chanting and the development of Indian musical scales.

Statement 2 is correct. Bharata Muni's Natyashastra, while encompassing various performing arts, is considered a foundational text for Indian musicology. It provides detailed insights into musical theory, including the concept of the octave and its divisions.  It's a crucial source for understanding the historical development of Indian music.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sarangadeva's Sangeet Ratnakara is a landmark text in Indian musicology, it identified and described *264* ragas, not 22 shrutis per octave. The number 22 shrutis is associated with earlier texts like Dattilam, which proposed a system of 22 microtones within an octave.  The Sangeet Ratnakara expanded significantly on the classification and description of ragas.


**5. With reference to  the Bhakti movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, was a follower of the Brahma Sampradaya and popularized Kirtans.
2.  Surdas, a blind devotee of Lord Krishna, was a disciple of Vallabhacharya and composed the Sursagar.
3.  Kabir, a 15th-century saint, was greatly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a contemporary figure of the Mughal era.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a key figure in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, a branch of the Brahma Sampradaya. He significantly popularized the practice of Kirtans (devotional singing) as a form of worship.  His teachings and practices continue to influence Vaishnava traditions.

Statement 2 is correct. Surdas, a renowned poet and devotee of Krishna, was indeed a disciple of Vallabhacharya, a prominent Vaishnava theologian. His magnum opus, the Sursagar, is a collection of devotional poems dedicated to Krishna and is highly revered in Vaishnava traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Kabir was a 15th-century Bhakti saint who predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi by over a century.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi was a prominent figure in the Mughal era, known for his conservative views on Islam.  Kabir's philosophy and teachings were distinctly his own, drawing from both Hindu and Islamic traditions.  The statement incorrectly links them chronologically and philosophically.


**6. With reference to the Sufi movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chishti order, founded by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, emphasized "pantheistic monism" (Wahadat-ul-wajood) and is associated with the annual Urs festival at Ajmer.
2. The Suhrawardi order, introduced to India by Sheikh Bahauddin Zakariya, rejected Chishti practices like bowing before initiation.
3. The Qadariya order, established in India by Shah Namatullah, gained prominence in Punjab and Sindh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chishti order, a prominent Sufi order in India, was indeed founded by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.  Their philosophy often incorporated the concept of "pantheistic monism," emphasizing the unity of being.  The annual Urs festival at Ajmer Sharif Dargah is a major event associated with this order.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Suhrawardi order, while also influential in India, did differ from the Chishti order in certain practices.  They rejected some Chishti rituals, such as bowing during initiation, showcasing a divergence in approaches to spiritual practice.

Statement 3 is correct. The Qadariya order, brought to India by Shah Namatullah, did gain considerable influence in regions like Punjab and Sindh.  This highlights the spread of different Sufi orders across the Indian subcontinent and their varying levels of regional impact.


**7. With reference to the  Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal, located in Gujarat, is known for its well-preserved dockyard, indicating significant maritime activity.
2.  Mohenjo-daro, situated in present-day Pakistan, yielded the famous bronze statue of the Dancing Girl.
3.  Rakhigarhi, in Haryana, is considered the smallest of the major Harappan sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal, a significant Harappan site in Gujarat, is renowned for its remarkably preserved dockyard.  This discovery provides strong evidence of the Harappans' advanced understanding of maritime technology and their engagement in extensive trade networks.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mohenjo-daro, one of the largest Harappan cities, is famous for its many archaeological finds, including the iconic bronze statue of the Dancing Girl.  This statue is considered a masterpiece of Harappan art and provides valuable insights into their artistic skills and cultural practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Rakhigarhi, located in Haryana, is actually considered one of the *largest* known Harappan sites, exceeding even Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in size based on current excavations.  This challenges the statement's assertion about its size and understates its importance.


**8. With reference to the  UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha was designated a World Heritage Site in 1984.
2. The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu, including the Shore Temple, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1986.
3. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) in Mumbai was recognized as a World Heritage Site in 2008.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sun Temple at Konark, a magnificent example of Kalinga architecture, was indeed inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1984.  Its intricate carvings and unique architectural design make it a significant cultural landmark.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, including the Shore Temple and other significant structures, was actually designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, not 1986. The statement incorrectly places the date of inscription.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) in Mumbai was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, not 2008.  The statement incorrectly places the date of inscription.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Jain philosophy:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core Jain principle, asserts the existence of a single, absolute truth.
2.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism are Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.
3.  The concept of the soul (Atman) is rejected in Jainism, similar to Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Anekantavada, a central tenet of Jainism, actually posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, rejecting the idea of a single, absolute truth.  It emphasizes the limitations of human perception and understanding in grasping the complete nature of reality. This concept is fundamentally different from the assertion of a singular, absolute truth.

Statement 2 is correct. The three jewels (Ratnatraya) – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Gyan), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) – form the cornerstone of Jain ethical and spiritual practice. They represent the three essential paths to liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).  These principles guide Jain life and actions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Unlike Buddhism, which denies the existence of an enduring self or soul (anatman), Jainism firmly believes in the existence of the soul (Atman). The soul is considered a fundamental and eternal entity, distinct from the body and mind.  The Jain path focuses on the purification and liberation of this soul.  The difference in perspective on the soul is a key distinction between Jainism and Buddhism.


**2. With reference to the Triratna of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Sangha (the monastic order) was established at Buddha's first sermon in Sarnath.
2.  The three jewels (Triratna) – Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha – represent different aspects of the path to enlightenment.
3.  Dhamma (Buddha's teachings) and Sangha (the monastic order) were both established before Buddha's first sermon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The establishment of the Sangha, the community of monks and nuns, is directly linked to Buddha's first sermon at Sarnath.  This marked the formalization of the monastic order and the beginning of the spread of Buddhist teachings.

Statement 2 is correct. The Triratna (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) represent the three fundamental pillars of Buddhist practice. Buddha represents the enlightened one, the model for spiritual attainment. Dhamma embodies the teachings and principles revealed by the Buddha, providing the path to liberation. Sangha represents the community that supports and guides practitioners on this path.  They are interconnected and essential components of the Buddhist tradition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Buddha's enlightenment was the foundation for his teachings, the formal establishment of both Dhamma (through his teachings) and Sangha (through the monastic order) occurred *after* his enlightenment and specifically, the Sangha's formalization at his first sermon in Sarnath. The act of teaching and the formation of a community to support the teachings are distinct events following the enlightenment.


**3. With reference to the history of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fourth Buddhist Council, held in Kashmir under Kanishka, led to the definitive split between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism.
2.  The Pali Canon, primarily associated with Theravada Buddhism, contains the complete collection of Buddha's teachings.
3.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes individual salvation, rejecting the concept of Bodhisattvas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Fourth Buddhist Council under Kanishka is significant in the development of Mahayana Buddhism, the split between Hinayana and Mahayana was a gradual process spanning centuries, not a single event at this council.  The council was important for codifying Mahayana scriptures, but the division of Buddhist schools was more complex and evolved over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pali Canon is the only surviving complete Buddhist canon and serves as the primary doctrinal source for Theravada Buddhism. It contains a vast collection of texts, including the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules), Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's discourses), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical treatises).  Its preservation and study are central to Theravada practice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mahayana Buddhism, in contrast to Hinayana's focus on individual enlightenment, emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who postpone their own nirvana to help all sentient beings achieve enlightenment.  The Bodhisattva path is a central tenet of Mahayana thought.


**4. With reference to Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara sect permits its monks to wear simple white clothing.
2.  Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is universally accepted within Jainism and considered equivalent to euthanasia.
3.  Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, is considered the founder of Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Digambara monks are traditionally known for their practice of nudity, symbolizing complete renunciation.  The wearing of white clothing is characteristic of Svetambara monks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sallekhana is a practice within some Jain traditions, it's not universally accepted and its comparison to euthanasia is debated.  The practice involves a gradual cessation of food and water, undertaken under specific conditions and with the guidance of spiritual leaders.  It's considered a form of self-sacrifice for spiritual liberation, not a form of suicide or euthanasia.  Legal challenges and varying interpretations exist.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mahavira is the 24th and last Tirthankara, Jainism doesn't have a single founder.  The tradition believes in a succession of Tirthankaras throughout history, each rediscovering and teaching the path to liberation.  Mahavira's teachings are considered a significant reformulation and revitalization of the Jain faith, but he is not considered the sole founder.


**5.  With reference to the concepts of Buddhism and Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Buddhism and Jainism reject the authority of the Vedas.
2.  Both Buddhism and Jainism believe in the concept of an eternal soul (Atman).
3.  Both Buddhism and Jainism advocate for non-violence (Ahimsa) as a core principle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both Buddhism and Jainism rejected the authority of the Vedas, the sacred scriptures of Hinduism.  This rejection was a significant departure from prevailing Brahmanical traditions and formed a crucial element of their respective philosophies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Jainism strongly believes in the existence of the Atman (soul), Buddhism rejects the concept of an eternal, unchanging self.  Buddhist philosophy emphasizes impermanence (Anicca) and the absence of a permanent self (Anatta).  This is a fundamental difference between the two traditions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both Buddhism and Jainism place immense importance on Ahimsa (non-violence). This principle extends beyond just refraining from physical harm to encompassing a compassionate approach towards all living beings.  It profoundly influences their ethical teachings and lifestyle choices.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain philosophy holds that the world is created and maintained by a Universal Soul.
2.  The concept of Anekantavada emphasizes the existence of a single, absolute truth that can fully describe reality.
3.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism are Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, symbolized by three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 correctly identifies the three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism and their symbolic representation on the Jain flag.  The Swastika, with three dots above it, symbolizes the Ratnatraya: Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra). These are the core principles for achieving liberation (moksha) in Jainism.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jainism does not posit a "Universal Soul" as the creator and maintainer of the world.  Instead, Jain cosmology is more complex, involving a cyclical universe with multiple souls (Jivas) interacting with matter (Pudgala) and governed by natural laws of karma.  The universe is not created by a single being but exists eternally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Anekantavada, a central tenet of Jainism, explicitly rejects the idea of a single, absolute truth.  It posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, none of which can claim to be the complete or sole truth.  This concept promotes tolerance and understanding of different viewpoints.


**2. With reference to the history of Buddhism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sthavira Nikaya and the Mahasamghika were two early schools of Buddhism that emerged after the death of the Buddha, with numerous sub-sects developing from each.
2.  The concept of Bodhisattva, central to Mahayana Buddhism, refers to an individual who delays their own enlightenment to help others achieve liberation, a concept absent in Theravada Buddhism.
3.  The Fourth Buddhist Council, held in Kashmir under the patronage of King Kanishka, resulted in the definitive split between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism, leading to the standardization of Mahayana scriptures in Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the early divisions within Buddhism.  Following the Buddha's death, the Sangha (monastic order) fragmented into various schools, with the Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika representing two major branches, each further subdividing into numerous sub-sects.  These early divisions reflect differing interpretations of the Buddha's teachings.

Statement 2 correctly explains the Bodhisattva concept within Mahayana Buddhism.  The Bodhisattva path emphasizes the postponement of one's own enlightenment to assist others in achieving liberation, a key distinction from Theravada Buddhism, which primarily focuses on individual enlightenment.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the Fourth Buddhist Council under Kanishka did contribute to the development of Mahayana Buddhism and the increased use of Sanskrit, it didn't mark a definitive, universally accepted split between Hinayana and Mahayana. The process of differentiation between these two schools was gradual and complex, spanning centuries. The council's role was more in codifying existing Mahayana traditions rather than causing the split itself.


**3. With reference to the Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain Agamas, considered sacred scriptures containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras, were originally compiled by the Ganadharas, the chief disciples of Mahavira.
2.  The present form of the Jain Agamas comprises 46 texts, including 12 Angas, 12 Upangas, and other categories, and were compiled during a council of Svetambara monks in Vallabhi during the mid-5th century AD.
3.  The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi, viewing them as a faithful representation of the original teachings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Ganadharas, Mahavira's chief disciples, are traditionally credited with the initial compilation of the Jain Agamas.  These texts represent the foundational scriptures of Jainism.

Statement 2 correctly describes the structure and compilation of the existing Agamas. The 46 texts are categorized into Angas, Upangas, and other categories. The Svetambara sect's council in Vallabhi is traditionally associated with the compilation of these texts in their current form.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Digambara sect rejects the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi. They believe that the original teachings were lost over time and that the Vallabhi compilation does not accurately reflect the original scriptures.  This difference in acceptance of canonical texts is a major point of divergence between the two main Jain sects.


**4. With reference to the two major schools of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara school permits women to become Tirthankaras, while the Svetambara school does not.
2.  The Svetambara monks adhere to the five restraints (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, and Brahmacharya), while Digambara monks follow only four, excluding Brahmacharya.
3.  The Digambara sect's monastic rules are generally considered more stringent than those of the Svetambara sect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digambara school does *not* believe women can be Tirthankaras, a significant doctrinal difference from the Svetambara school, which holds that Tirthankaras can be either male or female.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Svetambara school traditionally adheres to the five great vows (mahavrata), including Brahmacharya.  The Digambara school also observes these five vows.  The difference lies more in the interpretation and strictness of their application rather than the number of vows themselves.

Statement 3 is correct. The Digambara monastic rules are generally considered to be more rigorous and ascetic than those of the Svetambara school. This is reflected in the Digambara tradition of complete nudity for male monks, a practice not followed by Svetambara monks.


**5. With reference to the practices within Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered suicide by Jain scholars and is universally prohibited within the Jain community.
2.  Pratikraman is a daily ritual where Jains repent for their sins and resolve not to repeat them, with various forms practiced throughout the year.
3.  The Jain flag’s five colors represent the Pancha-Parameshthi, the five-fold hierarchy of religious authorities in Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sallekhana is a controversial practice,  Jain scholars do not universally consider it suicide.  They argue it's a form of self-liberation undertaken under specific circumstances and with proper guidance, distinct from impulsive self-harm.  However, legal challenges and varying interpretations within the Jain community exist regarding its permissibility.

Statement 2 correctly describes Pratikraman. This is a vital daily and periodic practice in Jainism involving confession and repentance for past misdeeds, aiming for self-improvement and spiritual progress.  Different forms of Pratikraman are observed at various intervals.

Statement 3 accurately explains the symbolism of the Jain flag's five colors. Each color represents a level in the five-fold hierarchy of religious authorities within Jainism: Arihant (red), Siddha (yellow), Acharya (white), Upadhyay (green), and Sadhu (dark blue).  This representation visually symbolizes the lineage of spiritual leadership in the Jain tradition.


**6. With reference to  Buddhist schools and their characteristics, consider the following statements:**

1. Hinayana Buddhism emphasizes individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation, rejecting idol worship, and primarily utilizes Pali as its sacred language.
2. Mahayana Buddhism, a more liberal school, embraces the worship of Buddha images and Bodhisattvas, aiming for universal liberation, and predominantly uses Sanskrit.
3. Vajrayana Buddhism, often influenced by Hinduism, incorporates tantric practices, mantras, and yantras, and considers the mantra path a faster route to Buddhahood than the six perfections of Mahayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key characteristics of the three major Buddhist schools. Statement 1 correctly highlights the emphasis on individual enlightenment, the rejection of idol worship (though this is not universally true within all Hinayana traditions), and the use of Pali in early Hinayana texts. Statement 2 correctly identifies the Mahayana emphasis on universal salvation, the acceptance of image worship, and the prevalence of Sanskrit. Statement 3 correctly describes Vajrayana Buddhism's tantric elements, the use of mantras and yantras, and the belief that the mantra path can be a quicker path to enlightenment than the six perfections emphasized in Mahayana.  While the influence of Hinduism on Vajrayana is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, the statement accurately reflects a common understanding of the school's practices.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, rejecting the idea of a single absolute truth.
2.  The concept of Ratnatraya (Three Jewels) in Jainism comprises Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, representing the path to liberation.
3.  Jainism, unlike Buddhism, explicitly affirms the existence of the soul (Atman) as the fundamental element of experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect core tenets of Jain philosophy. Anekantavada, literally meaning "many-sidedness," is a central doctrine emphasizing that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives, none of which is entirely exhaustive.  This contrasts with philosophies that posit a single, absolute truth.  The Ratnatraya (Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct) constitutes the three essential principles for achieving liberation (moksha) in Jainism, guiding the path towards spiritual perfection. Finally, unlike Buddhism's rejection of the concept of a permanent self (anatman), Jainism firmly believes in the existence of an individual soul (Atman), which undergoes transmigration and strives for liberation.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the true statements.


**2. With reference to the evolution of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the death of Buddha, primarily focused on the standardization of the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules).
2.  The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of Kanishka, is associated with the formal division of Buddhism into Hinayana and Mahayana schools.
3.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, who postpone their own enlightenment to aid others, is primarily associated with Hinayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The First Buddhist Council, convened soon after the Buddha's death, aimed to preserve and codify his teachings, with a primary focus on the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines monastic discipline and rules. Statement 2 is also correct. The Fourth Buddhist Council, under Kanishka's patronage, is widely considered a significant point in the development and formalization of the Mahayana school, marking a divergence from the earlier Hinayana traditions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bodhisattva ideal, representing the postponement of one's own enlightenment to help others achieve liberation, is a central concept within Mahayana Buddhism, not Hinayana. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct option.


**3. With reference to the different schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the attainment of Nirvana through individual practice of the Eightfold Path, primarily focusing on monastic life.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism promotes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals strive for enlightenment not just for themselves but for the benefit of all beings.
3.  Vajrayana Buddhism incorporates tantric practices, utilizing mantras and rituals for rapid spiritual advancement, and is strongly associated with Tibetan Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe key characteristics of the major Buddhist schools. Theravada Buddhism, often considered the oldest surviving school, emphasizes individual practice of the Eightfold Path to achieve Nirvana, with monastic life often seen as the ideal path.  Mahayana Buddhism introduces the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals strive for Buddhahood to benefit all sentient beings, making compassion and universal salvation central tenets. Vajrayana Buddhism, prevalent in Tibet and surrounding regions, incorporates tantric methods, including mantras and visualizations, to accelerate spiritual progress. Therefore, option (c) encompassing all three accurate statements is the correct answer.


**4. With reference to Jain sects and practices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara sect of Jainism, known for its emphasis on complete nudity among monks, permits women to attain the status of Tirthankara.
2.  The Svetambara sect, allowing monks to wear white clothes, strictly adheres to the five vows (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, Brahmacharya) as prescribed by Mahavira.
3.  Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting unto death, is considered a form of suicide within the Jain community and is universally prohibited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies regarding Jain sects and practices. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Digambara sect does *not* believe women can become Tirthankaras. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while Svetambaras generally follow the five vows, the strictness of adherence can vary among different sub-sects within the Svetambara tradition. Statement 3 is incorrect as Sallekhana, while a controversial practice, is not universally condemned as suicide within Jainism; some scholars argue it is a form of self-liberation under specific circumstances. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct, making (d) the appropriate choice.


**5. With reference to the major Jain pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Palitana temples in Gujarat are primarily dedicated to Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara, and are considered the holiest site for the Digambara sect.
2.  The Dilwara temples in Mount Abu, Rajasthan, are renowned for their intricate marble carvings and are significant for both Digambara and Svetambara Jains.
3.  Shravanabelagola in Karnataka houses the colossal Gomateshwara statue of Bahubali, the son of the first Tirthankara, and is primarily associated with the Svetambara sect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because, while the Palitana temples are dedicated to Rishabhanatha and are highly significant, they are considered holiest for the *Svetambara* sect, not the Digambara sect. Statement 2 is correct; the Dilwara temples are indeed famous for their intricate marble architecture and are revered by both sects. Statement 3 is incorrect because Shravanabelagola, with its Gomateshwara statue, is predominantly associated with the *Digambara* sect. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**6.  Consider the following statements about the philosophical schools of ancient India:**

1.  Samkhya philosophy posits the existence of two fundamental realities: Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter), emphasizing the path of knowledge (Jnana) for liberation.
2.  Nyaya philosophy focuses on logic and epistemology, establishing a system of reasoning and methods for acquiring valid knowledge.
3.  Vaisheshika philosophy primarily deals with the metaphysics of causation, explaining the categories of being and the nature of reality through atomism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately represent the core tenets of these prominent schools of Indian philosophy. Samkhya, one of the oldest schools, distinguishes between Purusha (pure consciousness) and Prakriti (unconscious matter) and advocates for self-knowledge (Jnana) to achieve liberation. Nyaya focuses on establishing a rigorous system of logic and epistemology to obtain valid knowledge, crucial for understanding reality. Vaisheshika, closely related to Nyaya, primarily deals with metaphysics and ontology, particularly exploring the concept of causation and the atomic structure of reality.  Hence, option (c), which includes all three correct statements, is the correct answer.


**7. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Charvaka (Lokayata) philosophy is a materialistic school that rejects the concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and the authority of the Vedas, emphasizing the pursuit of sensual pleasure.
2.  Buddhist philosophy, rejecting the concept of Atman (soul), emphasizes the impermanence of all things (Anicca) and the path to Nirvana through the elimination of craving.
3.  Jain philosophy, while accepting the existence of Atman, advocates for the practice of Ahimsa (non-violence) and the pursuit of liberation through the eradication of Karma.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements provide accurate descriptions of the heterodox schools. Charvaka, a materialistic school, rejects spiritual concepts like reincarnation and the authority of the Vedas, focusing on worldly pleasures.  Buddhist philosophy famously rejects the concept of a permanent self (Atman), emphasizing impermanence and the path to Nirvana through the cessation of craving. Jain philosophy, while believing in the soul (Atman), prioritizes non-violence (Ahimsa) and aims for liberation by eliminating karmic attachments.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to ancient Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vedas, composed in highly stylized Sanskrit poetry, are primarily concerned with religious rituals and philosophical insights into the nature of reality.
2. The Upanishads, forming part of the Vedic corpus, explore philosophical and spiritual themes, focusing on the concept of Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (individual self).
3. The epics, such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, primarily focus on historical narratives, offering insights into the social and political structures of ancient India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the nature of the Vedas and Upanishads. The Vedas, ancient scriptures, are primarily concerned with religious rites and rituals, containing hymns and mantras.  The Upanishads, later additions to the Vedic tradition, delve into philosophical and spiritual questions, exploring concepts like Brahman (ultimate reality) and the relationship between Atman (individual self) and Brahman.  Statement 3 is partially inaccurate; while the epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata do contain historical elements and insights into social structures, they are primarily narrative works of mythology and literature, not purely historical accounts. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct, making (a) the correct option.



**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of *Anekantavada* emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, rejecting absolutism.
2.  The *Ratnatraya*, comprising Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, forms the three jewels of Jainism.
3.  The *Swastika* symbol in Jainism represents the cyclical nature of the soul's journey through four states of existence, ultimately aiming for liberation as an *Arihant* or *Siddha*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect core tenets of Jain philosophy.  *Anekantavada*, meaning "many-sidedness," is a central doctrine emphasizing that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives, thus rejecting the notion of a single absolute truth. This contrasts with philosophies that posit a singular, definitive reality.  The *Ratnatraya* (three jewels) – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – are fundamental principles guiding the path to spiritual liberation in Jainism.  These represent the essential elements for achieving moksha. Finally, the *Swastika* symbol, often misinterpreted, holds significant meaning within Jain cosmology.  It depicts the soul's journey through four states of existence (deities, humans, animals, hell beings), influenced by karma, with the ultimate goal being liberation and attainment of *Arihant* (perfect being) or *Siddha* (liberated soul) status.  Therefore, all three statements are correct representations of Jain philosophical concepts.


**2. With reference to the teachings of Mahavira, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, is considered the founder of Jainism, establishing its core principles.
2.  Mahavira's teachings emphasized strict asceticism, renunciation of worldly attachments, and moral cultivation, particularly *ahimsa* (non-violence).
3.  Mahavira introduced the fifth great vow of *Brahmacharya* (chaste living) into the Jain ethical framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Mahavira is a pivotal figure in Jainism, it's inaccurate to solely credit him with its founding. Jainism existed before him, with 23 preceding Tirthankaras.  His role was to revitalize and propagate existing Jain principles.  Statements 2 and 3 correctly reflect Mahavira's central contributions. He strongly advocated for strict asceticism, complete renunciation of worldly desires, and the cultivation of high moral conduct, placing *ahimsa* at its core.  Crucially, he added *Brahmacharya* (chaste living) as the fifth major vow, augmenting the existing four.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to different schools of Buddhist thought, consider the following statements:**

1.  *Hinayana* Buddhism emphasizes individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation, rejecting image worship.
2.  *Mahayana* Buddhism promotes the concept of *Bodhisattvas*, who delay their own enlightenment to help others attain liberation.
3.  *Theravada* Buddhism, considered a branch of *Hinayana*, strictly adheres to the original teachings of the Buddha as preserved in the Pali Canon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key distinctions between the major schools of Buddhist thought.  *Hinayana* ("Lesser Vehicle"), often associated with Theravada, prioritizes individual enlightenment through self-cultivation and meditation, traditionally avoiding idol worship. *Mahayana* ("Greater Vehicle") introduces the *Bodhisattva* ideal, emphasizing compassion and the postponement of personal nirvana to guide others towards enlightenment.  *Theravada* ("School of the Elders"), while sometimes categorized under Hinayana, is distinct. It emphasizes the Pali Canon as the authoritative source of Buddhist teachings, aiming for individual liberation through rigorous practice.  The statements correctly capture the core tenets and differences between these influential schools of Buddhist thought.


**4. With reference to the Jain sects, consider the following statements:**

1.  *Digambara* monks traditionally practice complete nudity, while *Svetambara* monks wear simple white clothing.
2.  *Digambara* Jainism holds that women cannot attain the status of a Tirthankara, unlike *Svetambara* Jainism.
3.  Both *Digambara* and *Svetambara* traditions venerate the same set of canonical texts, known as the Jain Agamas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key differences between the *Digambara* and *Svetambara* sects of Jainism.  *Digambara* monks traditionally practice complete nudity as a symbol of renunciation, whereas *Svetambara* monks wear white clothing.  A significant doctrinal difference lies in the belief regarding the possibility of women achieving Tirthankara status. *Digambara* tradition denies this possibility, while *Svetambara* tradition accepts it.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the *Digambara* sect does *not* accept the authority of the Agamas compiled by the *Svetambaras*, claiming their own original scriptures were lost.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**5. With reference to the philosophical schools of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Samkhya* school, founded by Kapila, posits a dualistic reality comprising *Purusha* (consciousness) and *Prakriti* (matter).
2.  The *Yoga* school, systematized by Patanjali, emphasizes the union of *Purusha* and *Prakriti* through practices like meditation and *asanas*.
3.  The *Charvaka* school, a materialistic philosophy, rejects the concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and the authority of the Vedas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly identify core tenets of the mentioned philosophical schools. The *Samkhya* school, attributed to Kapila, is known for its dualistic ontology, distinguishing between the unchanging *Purusha* (pure consciousness) and the evolving *Prakriti* (matter). The *Yoga* school, associated with Patanjali, builds upon *Samkhya* by adding a practical path to liberation, emphasizing the union of *Purusha* and *Prakriti* through various practices including meditation and physical postures (*asanas*). The *Charvaka* school, a materialistic philosophy, is famously known for its rejection of supernatural concepts like reincarnation and an afterlife, and its dismissal of Vedic authority.  Thus, all three statements are accurate.


**6. With reference to  Buddhist literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The *Milinda Panha* is a dialogue between King Menander and the Buddhist monk Nagasena, exploring profound philosophical questions.
2. The *Mahavamsa*, written in Pali, chronicles the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, including accounts of the Buddha's visit.
3. The *Lalitavistara Sutra*, a Mahayana text, narrates the life of the Buddha from his birth to his first sermon at Sarnath.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe significant Buddhist texts.  *Milinda Panha* ("Questions of Milinda") is a well-known dialogue between the Greco-Bactrian king Menander I and the Buddhist monk Nagasena, delving into complex philosophical issues.  *Mahavamsa* ("Great Chronicle") is a major historical text in Pali that chronicles the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, including details about the Buddha’s visit and the subsequent development of the religion. *Lalitavistara Sutra* is a crucial Mahayana text that provides a detailed account of the Buddha's life, encompassing his birth, early years, and path to enlightenment, concluding with his first sermon.  Therefore, all three statements correctly reflect the content and significance of these important Buddhist literary works.


**7.  With reference to  Jain canonical literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas, consisting of 46 texts, are considered sacred scriptures containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras.
2. The Angas, a part of the Agamas, are primarily written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit and emphasize principles like non-violence and asceticism.
3. The Digambara sect accepts the same version of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi as authoritative scripture, unlike the Svetambara sect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of Jain canonical literature. The Jain Agamas, comprising 46 texts, are considered sacred scriptures, believed to contain the teachings of the Tirthankaras. The Angas, a significant part of the Agamas, are predominantly written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit and emphasize key Jain principles like *ahimsa* (non-violence), strict vegetarianism, asceticism, and compassion. Statement 3 is incorrect because the Digambara sect rejects the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi, asserting that the original scriptures were lost.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**8. With reference to the major pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya (Bihar) marks the location where the Buddha attained enlightenment.
2.  Palitana temples in Gujarat are considered among the holiest sites for Svetambara Jains, dedicated primarily to Rishabhanatha.
3.  Shravanabelagola in Karnataka features the Gomateshwara statue of Bahubali, the son of the first Jain Tirthankara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly identify significant pilgrimage sites associated with Buddhism and Jainism in India. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya marks the site of the Buddha's enlightenment, making it a central pilgrimage destination for Buddhists worldwide.  The Palitana temples in Gujarat, with numerous marble temples, are indeed considered among the holiest sites for Svetambara Jains, particularly venerating Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara.  Shravanabelagola in Karnataka houses the colossal Gomateshwara statue of Bahubali, the son of Rishabhanatha, a prominent figure in Jain tradition. Therefore, all three statements are accurate.


**9. With reference to Indian architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization is known for its urban planning, using standardized burnt bricks in construction.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture introduced the arcuate style, featuring arches and domes, replacing the earlier trabeate style.
3. The Vijayanagara kingdom is notable for its temple architecture, characterized by the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key features of different periods in Indian architectural history. The Harappan civilization demonstrates advanced urban planning and the use of standardized burnt bricks in their construction, showcasing remarkable engineering skills for its time. Indo-Islamic architecture significantly introduced the arcuate style, characterized by the prominent use of arches and domes, a departure from the earlier trabeate style that primarily used lintels and post-and-lintel systems.  The Vijayanagara kingdom's temple architecture is known for its inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions), which are significant architectural components within temple complexes.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**10. With reference to  Indian philosophical schools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mimamsa school focuses on interpreting and applying Vedic texts, emphasizing the importance of rituals for achieving salvation.
2.  The Vedanta school, particularly Advaita Vedanta as propounded by Shankaracharya, emphasizes the oneness of Atman (individual self) and Brahman (ultimate reality).
3. The Nyaya school emphasizes logic and reasoning as the primary means of attaining knowledge and liberation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the core principles of the mentioned Indian philosophical schools. The Mimamsa school is primarily concerned with the correct interpretation and application of Vedic rituals, believing that proper performance of these rituals is essential for achieving salvation or liberation.  The Vedanta school, particularly the Advaita Vedanta of Shankaracharya, focuses on the non-dualistic (Advaita) nature of reality, emphasizing the ultimate identity between the individual self (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman).  The Nyaya school highlights the importance of logic and reasoning as the primary means for acquiring knowledge and attaining liberation.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.



**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization primarily worshipped a single, supreme deity, evidenced by numerous depictions found at Mohenjo-daro.
2.  The standardized weights and measures used in the Harappan Civilization suggest a highly centralized and organized economic system.
3.  The discovery of horse remains at several Harappan sites indicates that chariots were a crucial element of their warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  The Harappan Civilization is renowned for its remarkably standardized weights and measures, found across various sites. This uniformity strongly suggests a well-organized and centralized system of trade and commerce, indicating sophisticated administrative capabilities. This standardization extended to bricks used in construction, further highlighting their advanced planning and engineering skills.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While evidence suggests the existence of various deities, including mother goddesses and animal figures, there's no conclusive evidence pointing to a single supreme deity as the central focus of their religious practices. The interpretation of religious symbols and practices remains a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the presence of horses in the late Harappan period is increasingly supported by archaeological evidence, the extent of their use in warfare remains unclear. The evidence doesn't definitively establish chariots as a central component of their military strategy.  Other forms of technology and weaponry likely played significant roles as well.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is central to Mahayana Buddhism.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the importance of monastic life as the sole path to achieving enlightenment.
3.  The Mahayana tradition completely rejects the authority of the Pali Canon, viewing it as irrelevant to their doctrines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana Buddhism. It emphasizes compassion and the selfless dedication to aiding all beings in their quest for enlightenment, even at the cost of one's own immediate liberation. This concept significantly differentiates Mahayana from earlier Buddhist schools.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While monastic life holds importance in Mahayana Buddhism, it's not presented as the only path to enlightenment.  Lay practitioners can also follow the Mahayana path and strive for Buddhahood.  The emphasis is on the commitment to the Bodhisattva ideal, which can be practiced within various lifestyles.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Mahayana Buddhism developed its own extensive body of scriptures and interpretations, it doesn't entirely reject the Pali Canon.  There's a complex relationship between the two, with some Mahayana schools drawing upon certain aspects of the Pali Canon while interpreting them differently within their own framework.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's architecture is characterized by the extensive use of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) within temple complexes.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers primarily patronized the Dravidian style of temple architecture, neglecting other regional styles.
3.  The Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure was significantly influenced by the Chola administrative model.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style is well-known for its incorporation of Kalyana Mandapas within its temple complexes.  These structures, dedicated to marriage ceremonies, are a prominent feature reflecting the empire's cultural and religious practices and architectural sophistication.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire's architecture shows influences of the Dravidian style, it wasn't exclusive.  Their architectural achievements demonstrate a synthesis of various regional styles, incorporating elements from different parts of the Indian subcontinent, resulting in a unique and diverse architectural landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara administrative system, while possessing some similarities with the Chola model, also had its own distinct features.  It was a complex system reflecting the needs and realities of a large, diverse empire, drawing upon and adapting existing models rather than directly copying them. The Vijayanagara system developed its own unique characteristics and institutions.


**4. With reference to Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by both Hinduism and Sufism, leading to a syncretic religious philosophy.
2.  Kabir was a staunch supporter of the caste system, believing in its inherent righteousness.
3.  Kabir's compositions primarily utilized Sanskrit, reflecting the high level of literacy among his followers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kabir's philosophy is a prime example of religious syncretism, drawing heavily from both Hindu and Sufi traditions. He seamlessly blended elements from both belief systems, creating a unique and inclusive spiritual path that transcended sectarian boundaries. This blend is evident in his poetry and teachings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kabir vehemently opposed the rigid caste system prevalent in his time. He emphasized the equality of all human beings regardless of their social standing, advocating for a society based on spiritual merit rather than birth. This revolutionary stance challenged the deeply entrenched social hierarchies of his era.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Kabir composed primarily in the vernacular languages of his time, specifically Awadhi and Hindi, making his teachings accessible to a wider audience.  His use of simple, relatable language was crucial to the widespread dissemination of his message among ordinary people, irrespective of their literacy levels in Sanskrit.


**5. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal style of painting significantly influenced the development of Rajput painting.
2.  Mughal painting initially focused on miniature illustrations of manuscripts, before shifting towards individual portraits and album art.
3.  The Mughal emperors actively discouraged the depiction of religious figures in their court paintings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal style of painting, with its exquisite detail, realistic portrayal, and sophisticated techniques, had a profound impact on the development of Rajput painting.  Rajput artists adapted and incorporated many Mughal elements into their own styles, leading to a vibrant and unique artistic synthesis. This interaction resulted in a rich exchange of artistic ideas and innovations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mughal painting's evolution is marked by a transition from manuscript illustrations to a greater emphasis on individual portraits and album art. This shift reflects the changing artistic preferences and patronage under different emperors, with Jahangir's reign being a turning point in this development. The focus shifted towards capturing individual likeness and naturalistic detail.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While some Mughal emperors may have had preferences for certain subject matter, they did not universally discourage the depiction of religious figures.  Many Mughal paintings, especially those from earlier periods, include depictions of Hindu deities and scenes from religious texts, reflecting the religious pluralism of the court.  The depiction of religious figures often served political and social purposes.


**6. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Barabar Caves, originally constructed for Ajivikas, are among the earliest examples of rock-cut architecture in India.
2.  The Ajanta Caves are primarily known for their Buddhist mural paintings, rather than their rock-cut architecture.
3.  The Ellora Caves showcase a unique blend of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples, reflecting religious syncretism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar Caves, dating back to the Mauryan period, are among the earliest surviving examples of rock-cut cave architecture in India.  Their unique construction techniques and the fact that they were specifically built for the Ajivika sect highlight the advanced engineering skills of the time and the religious tolerance of the Mauryan empire.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Ajanta Caves are remarkable examples of rock-cut architecture, they are primarily celebrated for their exquisite Buddhist mural paintings.  These paintings, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and other Buddhist narratives, are considered masterpieces of ancient Indian art and provide invaluable insights into the religious and cultural life of the period.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ellora Caves are a remarkable testament to religious harmony. The caves, carved out of a single rock face, house a collection of Buddhist chaityas and viharas, Hindu cave temples, and Jain cave temples. This unique coexistence reflects the religious tolerance and diverse cultural milieu of the time. The architectural styles of the caves also reflect the different religious traditions.


**7. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed advanced urban planning, evidenced by the grid-patterned layouts of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  The Indus Valley Civilization lacked any evidence of religious practices or beliefs.
3.  The Indus Valley Civilization's writing system has been fully deciphered, providing detailed insights into their culture and society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indus Valley Civilization is well-known for its remarkably advanced urban planning. Cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa featured grid-like street layouts, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, indicating a high level of urban organization and engineering skill. This advanced planning is a hallmark of their civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Indus Valley Civilization's religious practices remain partially enigmatic due to the undeciphered script, archaeological evidence suggests the presence of religious beliefs and practices.  The discovery of various artifacts, including figurines, seals with symbolic representations, and ritualistic structures, indicates that religion played a significant role in their culture. The interpretation of these findings is still ongoing.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered, posing a significant challenge to scholars attempting to understand their language, literature, and societal organization.  While progress has been made in identifying some symbols and patterns, a comprehensive understanding of their writing system remains elusive.  This lack of decipherment limits our direct access to their cultural narratives.


**8. With reference to  the  Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu, neglecting other Hindu deities.
2.  The Bhakti saints composed extensively in vernacular languages, making their teachings accessible to a wider audience.
3.  The Bhakti movement was confined to South India, having minimal impact on the North.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement had prominent Vaishnava (Vishnu-worshipping) traditions, it wasn't limited to the worship of Vishnu.  The movement encompassed a wide spectrum of devotional practices, including Shaivism (Shiva worship) and Shaktism (Devi worship).  The emphasis was on personal devotion to a chosen deity, irrespective of sectarian affiliation.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of the key features of the Bhakti movement was the widespread use of vernacular languages in its devotional literature and hymns.  This linguistic shift made the movement's message accessible to a broader population, transcending the limitations of Sanskrit, which was primarily understood by the elite.  This facilitated wider religious participation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement significantly impacted both North and South India.  While regional variations existed, the movement fostered a pan-Indian devotional culture, creating a sense of religious unity and transcending regional boundaries.  The movement's influence spanned across various regions.


**9. With reference to the Gupta Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gupta Empire witnessed a significant decline in artistic and literary achievements compared to the preceding Mauryan Empire.
2.  The Gupta Empire's administration was highly centralized, with the emperor exercising absolute authority.
3.  The Gupta Empire saw the flourishing of Sanskrit literature, with works like the plays of Kalidasa gaining prominence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gupta period is widely recognized as a "Golden Age" in Indian history, marked by a flourishing of artistic and literary achievements.  This era witnessed significant advancements in various fields, including sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, and science.  The Gupta period built upon and extended the accomplishments of earlier eras.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gupta emperors held considerable authority, the empire's administration wasn't entirely centralized.  The system involved a degree of decentralization, with regional governors and officials exercising significant autonomy in their respective jurisdictions.  The balance between central and regional power varied over time.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gupta period was a golden age for Sanskrit literature.  This era saw the creation of numerous significant works, including the celebrated plays of Kalidasa (Abhijnanashakuntalam, Meghaduta, etc.), which are still studied and admired today.  The Gupta patronage encouraged a flourishing of literary activity.


**10. With reference to Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jainism believes in the concept of Ahimsa (non-violence) as a fundamental principle.
2.  Jainism rejects the authority of the Vedas and the concept of a creator God.
3.  Jainism advocates for the complete annihilation of the self (atman) as the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ahimsa (non-violence) is a core tenet of Jain philosophy.  Jains strive to minimize harm to all living beings, extending compassion even to the smallest creatures. This principle guides their lifestyle choices, including dietary habits and professional practices.

Statement 2 is correct. Jainism, along with Buddhism, rejects the authority of the Vedas as a source of ultimate truth. It also doesn't subscribe to the belief in a creator God, advocating instead for a cosmos governed by natural laws of karma and reincarnation.  The emphasis is on self-realization through ethical conduct and spiritual practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Jainism believes in the existence of the atman (soul), which is not annihilated but purified and liberated from the cycle of birth and rebirth.  The ultimate goal is to achieve moksha (liberation) by freeing the soul from karmic bondage, not its destruction.  The soul's purity and liberation are the central aims.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core Jain principle, asserts the existence of a single, absolute truth.
2.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism are Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, symbolized by three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag.
3.  The concept of the soul (Atman) is central to Jain philosophy, unlike Buddhism, which rejects the concept of a permanent self.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Anekantavada, a central tenet of Jainism, actually posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, rejecting the notion of a single, absolute truth.  It emphasizes the limitations of human understanding in grasping the complete nature of reality.  This concept contrasts sharply with philosophies that propose a singular, definitive truth.

Statement 2 is correct. The three jewels (Ratnatraya) — Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct — are fundamental principles in Jainism.  The three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag indeed represent these three jewels.  The Swastika itself symbolizes the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, and the path towards liberation.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key difference between Jainism and Buddhism lies in their stance on the Atman or soul. Jainism firmly believes in the existence of the soul as a distinct entity that undergoes transmigration, while Buddhism rejects the concept of a permanent, unchanging self.  The Jain emphasis on the soul's liberation from the cycle of rebirth underscores this difference.


**2. With reference to the evolution of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first Buddhist council, held at Rajgriha, resulted in the compilation of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.
2.  The concept of Sangha (the monastic order) was initiated by Buddha at his first sermon in Kushinagar.
3.  Hinayana Buddhism, meaning "the lesser vehicle," emphasizes individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation, rejecting idol worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first Buddhist council at Rajgriha focused on the compilation of the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules) and the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's teachings). The Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical analysis) was compiled later.  This demonstrates the early prioritization of monastic discipline and doctrinal preservation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sangha was indeed established by Buddha, his first sermon was delivered at Sarnath (Deer Park), not Kushinagar (where he attained Mahaparinirvana). This pivotal sermon marked the beginning of the dissemination of Buddhist teachings.

Statement 3 is correct. Hinayana Buddhism, often contrasted with Mahayana, emphasizes individual enlightenment through rigorous self-discipline and meditation, generally rejecting the later Mahayana emphasis on elaborate rituals and deity worship.  The focus is on attaining Nirvana through personal effort and adherence to monastic precepts.



**3. With reference to the schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, founded by Kapila, advocates for a dualistic worldview, positing the separation of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2.  The Vaisheshika school, associated with Kanada, developed an atomic theory, proposing that all material objects are composed of indivisible particles called atoms.
3.  The Mimamsa school, primarily concerned with Vedic interpretation, emphasizes ritualistic practices as the primary means for achieving salvation, rejecting the importance of knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, is characterized by its dualistic view of reality.  It distinguishes between Purusha (pure consciousness, unchanging and independent) and Prakriti (matter, dynamic and evolving).  This fundamental duality shapes the Samkhya understanding of the cosmos and the path to liberation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaisheshika school, another of the six orthodox schools, is notable for its detailed analysis of the physical world.  It developed a sophisticated atomic theory, explaining the composition of matter through the combination of indivisible atoms (paramāṇu).  This theory contributed significantly to early Indian physics.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Mimamsa school focuses heavily on Vedic interpretation and ritual, it doesn't entirely reject the importance of knowledge.  Understanding the proper performance of rituals, and the underlying principles of the Vedas, is considered crucial for attaining salvation.  Knowledge is therefore instrumental in achieving the correct ritualistic practice.


**4. With reference to the spread of Indian religions abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism to Tibet was primarily facilitated by the efforts of King Ashoka, who sent missionaries to establish monasteries.
2.  The Cham people of Vietnam built numerous Hindu temples, indicating the significant influence of Hinduism in the region.
3.  The migration of Jain communities to East Africa and North America demonstrates the global reach of Jainism in modern times.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While King Ashoka played a crucial role in spreading Buddhism within India and to Sri Lanka (sending his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta), the primary spread of Buddhism to Tibet was through other individuals, including scholars and translators.  The translation of Buddhist scriptures into Tibetan was a critical element.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cham people of Vietnam are known for their construction of numerous Hindu temples, showcasing the extent of Hinduism’s influence in Southeast Asia.  This highlights the historical interaction and cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia.

Statement 3 is correct. The global diaspora of the Jain community, with significant populations in East Africa and North America, demonstrates the religion's capacity to adapt and thrive in diverse cultural contexts.  This reflects the resilience and adaptability of Jainism in a globalized world.



**5. With reference to ancient Indian medical practices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sushruta Samhita, a 6th-century BC treatise, provides the earliest known description of cataract surgery.
2.  Ayurveda, originating in the pre-Vedic period, emphasizes the use of metals, minerals, and chemical products as primary treatment methods.
3.  The Siddha system of medicine, a regional variant of Ayurveda, is characterized by its focus on herbal remedies and avoidance of chemical substances.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sushruta Samhita, a foundational text of ancient Indian surgery, contains detailed descriptions of surgical procedures, including cataract surgery.  This highlights the advanced medical knowledge present in ancient India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ayurveda does incorporate some mineral and metallic substances in its therapeutic approaches, it primarily emphasizes herbal remedies, dietary adjustments, and lifestyle practices. The prominence of metals and minerals is more characteristic of Siddha medicine.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Siddha system, prevalent in South India, is known for its extensive use of metals, minerals, and chemical substances alongside herbal remedies.  This makes it distinct from the primarily herbal focus of some aspects of Ayurveda.


**1. With reference to early Buddhist schools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika were the two main branches that emerged after the passing of the Buddha, with further sub-sects developing later.
2. The Theravada school, which emphasizes individual enlightenment, is considered a direct descendant of the Sthaviravada sub-sect of Hinayana Buddhism.
3.  The Mahayana school, which prioritizes the bodhisattva path and universal salvation, emerged significantly later than Hinayana, with the Kushan emperor Kanishka playing a key role in its propagation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of early Buddhist schools.  The initial schism within the Sangha resulted in the Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika, representing a crucial early divergence in Buddhist thought and practice.  Theravada Buddhism, primarily found in Southeast Asia, directly traces its lineage to the Sthaviravada tradition, maintaining a strong emphasis on individual practice and the attainment of Nirvana through the Eightfold Path.  The Mahayana school, characterized by its focus on the Bodhisattva ideal and the pursuit of enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, emerged later, gaining prominence during the Kushan period under the patronage of Emperor Kanishka, whose reign is associated with a significant expansion of Mahayana Buddhism.  Therefore, the correct option is (d), as all three statements are historically accurate.


**2. With reference to the concepts and philosophy of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Four Noble Truths form the foundational tenets of Buddhism, outlining the nature of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path to its cessation.
2. The Noble Eightfold Path, a central component of Buddhist practice, outlines eight interconnected principles for ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom, leading to liberation from suffering.
3.  Buddhism rejects the Vedic authority and the concept of an eternal soul (Atman), contrasting sharply with the core beliefs of Brahmanical Hinduism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of core Buddhist doctrines.  The Four Noble Truths are fundamental to the Buddhist understanding of existence, providing a framework for understanding the nature of suffering (dukkha) and the path to liberation. The Noble Eightfold Path, intricately interwoven with the Four Noble Truths, details the practical steps individuals must take to overcome suffering and achieve enlightenment.  Finally, a defining difference between Buddhism and Brahmanical Hinduism lies in its rejection of Vedic authority and the concept of Atman, the eternal self.  Buddhism instead emphasizes impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta) as fundamental truths.  Therefore, option (d) is correct because all three statements accurately reflect core aspects of Buddhist philosophy.


**3. With reference to the Four Buddhist Councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death in Rajgriha, resulted in the standardization and recitation of the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules) and the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's teachings).
2. The Second Council, held in Vaishali, primarily addressed and resolved ten points of dispute concerning monastic discipline within the Vinaya Pitaka.
3. The Fourth Council, convened under the patronage of Kanishka, witnessed the formal division of Buddhism into Hinayana and Mahayana schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Fourth Council is associated with the growing distinction between Hinayana and Mahayana, it didn't formally *divide* Buddhism.  The gradual evolution of Mahayana from earlier schools is a more accurate representation.  Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the outcomes of the First and Second Councils. The First Council, held at Rajgriha under the patronage of Ajatashatru, focused on establishing a canonical record of the Buddha's teachings and monastic rules. The Second Council, convened in Vaishali, addressed significant disputes regarding monastic discipline, resolving ten key points of contention.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.  The Fourth Council, while significant in the development of Mahayana, did not formally codify the division between the two schools.


**4. With reference to the major schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Hinayana Buddhism, often referred to as the "Lesser Vehicle," emphasizes individual enlightenment and traditionally rejected the worship of Buddha images.
2. Mahayana Buddhism, or the "Greater Vehicle," promotes the Bodhisattva ideal, emphasizing the pursuit of enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, and typically incorporates the worship of Buddha images.
3. Theravada Buddhism, considered the oldest surviving branch, adheres closely to the Pali Canon and emphasizes the attainment of Nirvana through the Noble Eightfold Path, aligning more closely with the early Hinayana traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the characteristics of the major Buddhist schools.  Hinayana Buddhism, with its focus on individual liberation (Nirvana) and its historical aversion to iconography, contrasts with Mahayana Buddhism's emphasis on universal salvation (Bodhisattva ideal) and its common use of devotional imagery.  Theravada Buddhism, rooted in the Pali Canon, maintains a strong connection to early Buddhist practices and the path to individual Nirvana, representing a lineage that has survived to the present day.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing the key distinctions among these significant schools of Buddhist thought and practice.


**5. With reference to the Bodhisattvas in Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Avalokiteshvara, often depicted holding a lotus flower (Padmapani), is associated with compassion and is considered one of the three protective deities surrounding the Buddha.
2.  Vajrapani, another of the three protective deities, is linked to the power and strength of the Buddha, often wielding a vajra (thunderbolt).
3.  Maitreya, the future Buddha, is expected to appear on Earth in the future to teach the Dharma, and is sometimes associated with the Laughing Buddha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe prominent Bodhisattvas within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. Avalokiteshvara, known as the Bodhisattva of Compassion, is frequently depicted with a lotus flower and is a key figure in Mahayana Buddhism, often considered one of the three protective deities of the Buddha. Vajrapani, the Bodhisattva of Power, is another of these three protectors and is typically shown wielding a vajra.  Maitreya, the future Buddha, is an important figure of anticipation within Buddhist cosmology, expected to appear in the future to guide humanity.  The association of Maitreya with the Laughing Buddha is a popular, though not universally accepted, interpretation.  Therefore, the correct option is (d), as all three statements correctly identify and describe key characteristics of these important Bodhisattvas.


**6. With reference to Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Jainism, unlike Buddhism, affirms the existence of the soul (Atman) as a fundamental aspect of reality.
2.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism are Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, forming the path to liberation (moksha).
3.  The five vows of Jainism are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-attachment).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately represent core tenets of Jain philosophy and practice.  Unlike Buddhism's doctrine of Anatta (non-self), Jainism strongly emphasizes the existence of Atman, the soul, which is considered the fundamental entity striving for liberation.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – form the cornerstone of Jain ethical and spiritual practice, providing a pathway to liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Finally, the five vows of Jainism, encompassing Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-attachment), are central to the Jain way of life, aiming to minimize harm and attachment to the material world.  Therefore, option (d) is correct because all three statements accurately reflect foundational Jain beliefs.


**7. With reference to the two major schools of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Digambara school traditionally adheres to a more austere ascetic practice, with monks traditionally practicing nudity.
2. The Svetambara school allows monks to wear simple white clothing, representing a less stringent ascetic ideal.
3. Both Digambara and Svetambara schools agree on the number of Tirthankaras and the central tenets of Jain philosophy, but differ on certain details of practice and interpretation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict the contrasting ascetic practices of the Digambara and Svetambara schools. Digambara monks traditionally practice nudity as a demonstration of extreme renunciation, while Svetambara monks wear simple white clothes.  However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While both schools accept the same core tenets of Jainism, they differ significantly on several key points regarding cosmology, the nature of the soul, and the interpretation of certain scriptures. Their differences extend beyond mere practice and involve fundamental theological disagreements. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.


**8. With reference to the major pilgrimage sites in India associated with Buddhism and Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Bodh Gaya in Bihar is a significant Buddhist pilgrimage site, marking the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment.
2.  Palitana in Gujarat is a major Jain pilgrimage site, featuring numerous temples on the Shatrunjaya hills, considered sacred by the Svetambara sect.
3.  Both Buddhist and Jain pilgrimage sites are found across various regions of India, reflecting the historical spread of these religions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate. Bodh Gaya holds immense significance in Buddhism as the location where Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Palitana, with its multitude of temples perched on the Shatrunjaya hills, is a highly revered pilgrimage center for Jains, particularly the Svetambara sect.  The widespread distribution of both Buddhist and Jain pilgrimage sites across India demonstrates the historical reach and influence of these religions throughout the subcontinent.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all three statements are accurate regarding the geographical distribution and religious significance of these pilgrimage centers.


**9. With reference to Indian philosophical schools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samkhya school emphasizes the dualism of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter) and does not posit the existence of a creator God.
2. The Nyaya school focuses on logic and epistemology, outlining a system for valid reasoning and knowledge acquisition.
3. The Vaisheshika school, closely related to Nyaya, focuses on metaphysics and the categories of reality, emphasizing atomism and causation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the core tenets of these prominent Indian philosophical schools. The Samkhya school is characterized by its dualistic ontology, positing Purusha (pure consciousness) and Prakriti (matter) as two fundamental realities, without a supreme creator God. The Nyaya school, a foundational school of Indian logic, provides a systematic framework for valid reasoning and knowledge acquisition, emphasizing the importance of perception, inference, and other sources of knowledge.  Vaisheshika, closely intertwined with Nyaya, delves into metaphysics, categorizing reality into various substances and focusing on atomism and the concept of causation.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all three statements accurately reflect the essential features of these classical schools of Indian philosophy.


**10. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Buddhism rejects the authority of the Vedas and the concept of an eternal soul (Atman).
2.  Jainism, while rejecting Vedic authority, affirms the existence of the soul (Atman) as a fundamental reality.
3.  The Charvaka school, a materialistic philosophy, rejects the concepts of an afterlife and the existence of a supernatural realm.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately characterize the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy. Buddhism, a prominent heterodox tradition, explicitly rejects the Vedic scriptures and the concept of an eternal self (Atman), emphasizing instead the impermanence of all things and the absence of a permanent self.  Jainism, another major heterodox school, also rejects Vedic authority but maintains the concept of Atman, the soul, which undergoes a process of purification to attain liberation.  The Charvaka school, known for its materialistic outlook, denies the existence of an afterlife and any supernatural realm, focusing solely on material reality and sensory experience.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, reflecting the key distinctions and commonalities among these three significant heterodox philosophical systems.



**1. Consider the following statements about Jain cosmology:**

1.  Arihants and Siddhas reside in Siddhashila, an eternal place at the universe's top.
2.  The three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag represent Ratnatraya (Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct).
3.  The Swastika on the Jain flag symbolizes the soul's cyclical journey through four forms (deities, humans, animals/plants, hell beings), with Karma determining its progression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Jain cosmology as described in the provided text.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Siddhashila as the eternal abode of liberated souls (Arihants and Siddhas). Statement 2 accurately describes the symbolism of the three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag, representing the three jewels (Ratnatraya) central to Jain philosophy. Statement 3 correctly explains the Swastika's representation of the soul's cyclical journey through different forms of existence, influenced by Karma.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements within these statements regarding Jain beliefs. The options designed to distract the candidate by suggesting only partial correctness fail to account for the holistic accuracy of the statements concerning Jain cosmological understanding.


**2. With reference to Jain sects, consider the following statements:**

1.  Digambaras believe women cannot be Tirthankaras and that Malli was a male.
2.  Svetambaras adhere to only four restraints (excluding Brahmacharya) to attain Kevalya, following Parshvanatha's teachings.
3.  Both Digambara and Svetambara sects accept the Tattvartha-sutra by Umaswati as an authoritative Jain text.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of the distinctions and commonalities between the Digambara and Svetambara sects of Jainism. Statement 1 correctly highlights a key difference: the Digambara belief that women cannot attain Tirthankara status and their interpretation of Malli's gender. Statement 2 accurately points out the Svetambara adherence to four, rather than five, restraints for achieving Kevalya (liberation), reflecting their emphasis on Parshvanatha's teachings. Statement 3 correctly notes the acceptance of the Tattvartha-sutra by both sects, highlighting a shared canonical text.  The options are designed to mislead candidates by suggesting disagreements where there is shared belief or vice-versa, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the Jain theological distinctions.


**3. With reference to Buddhist schools, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the core tenets and practices of the three major Buddhist schools. Statement 1 correctly points to the Pali Canon as the foundational text of Theravada, emphasizing its language and role. Statement 2 accurately contrasts the Mahayana emphasis on universal liberation (through the Bodhisattva path) with the Theravada focus on individual Nirvana. Statement 3 correctly identifies Vajrayana's incorporation of Tantric elements as a distinguishing feature, placing it within the Mahayana tradition.  The options serve as distractors, playing on potential confusion between the schools' goals and practices, underscoring the importance of detailed knowledge of Buddhist philosophy.

(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  The Dharma-chakra-pravartana (turning of the wheel of Dharma) did indeed take place at Sarnath, not Kushinagar (where Buddha passed away).  The Sangha (monastic order) was formed after Buddha's enlightenment; he delivered his first sermon to his first five disciples at Sarnath.  The statement about Bimbisara and Ajatashatru's contemporaneity with Buddha is also correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the Sangha was formed only after Buddha's enlightenment and first sermon. Options are designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge of chronology and key events in Buddha's life, emphasizing the importance of factual accuracy.


**5. With reference to the Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas, comprising 46 texts including 12 Angas, 12 Upangas, etc., were originally compiled by the Ganadharas, the chief disciples of Mahavira.

(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Anekantavada is indeed a fundamental Jain principle emphasizing the multifaceted nature of truth.  The five restraints are central to Jain ethics, and while the text mentions Mahavira's association with the fifth, it doesn't explicitly state he *added* it.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Rajasthan High Court initially banned Sallekhana, the Supreme Court later stayed that decision.  The options test knowledge of key Jain philosophical concepts and practices, including the nuances of legal status and scholarly interpretations of Sallekhana.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Maratha rulers, particularly during the reign of the Bhonsles, were major patrons of the Thanjavur school, contributing significantly to its development and style.  Their patronage fostered the distinctive characteristics of the school, including the use of vibrant colours, gold leaf, and detailed depictions of Hindu deities and mythological narratives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Thanjavur school is renowned for its intricate gold-leaf work, it hasn't received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag specifically for this technique. GI tags are usually granted to specific products or crafts from a particular region, and while Thanjavur paintings as a whole might have a GI tag, it's not explicitly for the gold leaf application.

Statement 3 is correct. The Thanjavur school is celebrated for its rich and detailed depictions of Hindu deities and scenes from Hindu mythology and epics.  These religious themes formed the core of the artistic production of the school, reflecting the religious and cultural context of its patrons and artists.  This focus on religious imagery is a defining characteristic that sets it apart from other painting schools in India.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raja Ravi Varma, indeed considered the father of Modern Indian Art in India, was from Kerala. His iconic painting, "Ravana Kidnapping Sita & killing Jatayu," is a celebrated example of his mastery of combining traditional Indian artistic styles with Western techniques.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bengal School of Art was a pivotal movement in modern Indian art, and both Abanindranath Tagore (a leading figure and pioneer) and Rabindranath Tagore (who influenced the movement through his philosophy and patronage) played crucial roles in its development and ideology.  Their contributions shaped the style and direction of the school, emphasizing a revival of traditional Indian aesthetics.

Statement 3 is also correct. Pattachitra is a highly recognized traditional painting style from Odisha. The name itself reflects its medium – “patta” meaning cloth, and “chitra” meaning picture.  The distinct technique, often involving natural pigments and intricate detailing, makes it a unique and identifiable art form of the region.  Thus, all three statements are correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Krishna's depiction as a flute player holds significant religious and cultural importance, making it a popular subject for artistic expression.  Its prevalence highlights the enduring appeal of this particular iconography.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Madhubani painting is indeed from Bihar, characterized by its folk style and vibrant colors, Manjusha painting is not associated with Rajasthan.  Manjusha painting is primarily associated with Bihar as well. The statement incorrectly links Manjusha painting to Rajasthan.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bundi school is a distinct school within the broader Rajput style, known for its characteristic use of blue pigments, creating a unique atmospheric effect in its landscapes and depictions.  This preference for blue and the mastery of atmospheric perspective are key features distinguishing the Bundi school from other Rajput painting traditions. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Indian philosophies:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samkhya school, a prominent school of Indian philosophy, posits that liberation (moksha) is achieved through the realization of the true nature of the self (purusha) and its distinction from matter (prakriti).  This self-knowledge, rather than divine grace or external factors, is the central path to liberation in Samkhya.

Statement 2 is correct. The Charvaka (Lokayata) school is known for its radical materialism.  It rejects the concepts of a soul, reincarnation, and an afterlife, asserting that only what is perceptible to the senses is real.  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain form the core of its ethical framework.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Vedanta school is a broad philosophical system with various sub-schools.  Shankara's Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality (Brahman), advocating for liberation through knowledge (jnana).  Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, in contrast, emphasizes the qualified non-dualism, highlighting the importance of devotion (bhakti) to the personal God, Vishnu.  The diversity of viewpoints within Vedanta underscores its rich intellectual history.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Even though Haidar Ali seized power from the Wodeyars, he continued the practice of featuring Hindu deities, specifically Shiva and Parvati, on his coins.  This continuity in coinage design suggests a pragmatic approach to maintain a link with the existing religious sentiments of the population.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Coinage Act of 2011 indeed superseded the 1906 Act.  A notable change was the broader definition of "coin," which now encompasses commemorative coins and even one-rupee notes issued by the government. This reflects the evolution of monetary systems and the inclusion of various forms of currency under legal definition.   All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Indian coinage history and legislation.

Bodhisattvas are beings who have attained enlightenment but choose to remain in the cycle of rebirth to assist others in their spiritual journey. This altruistic ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana philosophy.

Statement 2 is correct. Theravada Buddhism, often considered the older branch, centers on the path to Arhatship.  Arhats are individuals who have achieved enlightenment through their own practice and have escaped the cycle of suffering and rebirth.  The Eightfold Path is the core practice for attaining this state.

Statement 3 is correct. Vajrayana Buddhism integrates tantric practices, including mantras (sacred sounds) and yantras (geometric diagrams), into its path to enlightenment. These practices are believed to accelerate the process of spiritual development, offering a quicker route to Buddhahood than traditional methods. Therefore, all three statements accurately describe core tenets of the different schools of Buddhism.

This extensive trade network facilitated the exchange of not only goods but also cultural ideas, religious beliefs, and artistic styles, contributing to a wider dissemination of Indian culture.

Statement 3 is correct.  Indian contributions to mathematics were substantial.  The decimal number system, along with advancements in algebra and trigonometry, were transmitted to the Arab world through trade and scholarly exchange.  Arab scholars built upon these Indian foundations, and the knowledge eventually spread to Europe, significantly influencing the development of Western mathematics. Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the various ways in which Indian culture spread globally.

3. The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement 2 correctly identifies the three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism as Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, actually posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, thus rejecting the notion of a single, absolute truth.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Digambara sect, unlike the Svetambaras, rejects the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi, believing the original teachings were lost. Therefore statement 3 is also incorrect. The question tests factual recall of key Jain concepts and the differences between its sects. The distractors are designed to exploit potential misconceptions about Anekantavada and the Digambara's view on the Agamas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The Pali Canon is indeed the only complete surviving Buddhist canon.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the first Buddhist council was held at Rajgriha under the patronage of King Ajatashatru, not Vaishali under King Kalasoka (that was the second council).  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Bodhisattva concept is central to Mahayana Buddhism, not Hinayana.  The question tests knowledge of the historical development of Buddhism, its key councils, and the differences between its major schools.  The options are designed to confuse candidates by mixing up details about the councils and misattributing the Bodhisattva concept.


**3. With reference to ancient Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rig Veda primarily focuses on themes of worldly prosperity and natural beauty.
2. The Yajur Veda is primarily a ritual Veda, acting as a guidebook for sacrificial rituals.
3.  The Atharva Veda is solely dedicated to hymns praising Lord Indra.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the nature of the Rig Veda and Yajur Veda respectively. The Rig Veda, with its hymns dedicated to various deities, does indeed focus significantly on worldly prosperity and the beauty of nature.  The Yajur Veda serves as a guide for priests conducting sacrifices, making it primarily a ritual Veda.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Rig Veda features hymns dedicated to Indra, the Atharva Veda is broader in scope, covering various aspects of life, including healing, magic, and everyday problems.  The question tests knowledge of the content and characteristics of the four Vedas. The distractors employ misleading information about the Atharva Veda's focus and the Rig Veda's themes.


**4. With reference to the philosophies of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samkhya school propounds a purely spiritual view of the creation of the universe, rejecting any role for Prakriti.

3. The Vaisheshika school developed the atomic theory, explaining the universe through atoms and molecules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate representations of the Yoga and Vaisheshika schools. The Yoga school does indeed aim for the union of Purusha and Prakriti through yogic practices.  The Vaisheshika school is correctly identified as the proponent of the atomic theory in ancient India. Statement 1 is incorrect because Samkhya philosophy acknowledges Prakriti (nature) as a crucial element in the creation of the universe, even though it also emphasizes the distinct nature of Purusha (spirit).  The question assesses understanding of the key tenets of three prominent schools of Indian philosophy, focusing on their cosmological and epistemological views.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's depth of knowledge by presenting a distorted version of the Samkhya school's stance.


**5. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe aspects of Charvaka and Jain philosophies. The Charvaka school is known for its materialistic approach, emphasizing worldly pleasures and rejecting the idea of an afterlife. Jainism, in contrast to Buddhism, does uphold the concept of the soul (Atman). Statement 2 is incorrect; both Buddhism and Jainism reject the authority of the Vedas.  The question tests knowledge of the heterodox schools, their core beliefs, and their differences from orthodox schools.  The distractors attempt to confuse candidates by misrepresenting the Buddhist stance on the Vedas and creating ambiguity around the core beliefs of the heterodox schools.


**6. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are three main racial groups of the Indian subcontinent.
2. The Panchayatan style refers to a religious sect.
3. The Lingaraja Temple is located in Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are architectural styles, not racial groups. Panchayatan refers to a style of temple construction, not a religious sect.  The Lingaraja Temple is situated in Bhubaneswar, not Bijapur. This question tests knowledge of Indian temple architecture, its stylistic variations, and the locations of significant temples.  All options are incorrect, requiring the candidate to identify the inaccuracies in each statement, thus making it a challenging question designed to assess precise knowledge.


**7. With reference to the religious history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sautrantika and Sammitiya were sects of Buddhism.
2. Sarvastivada held that the constituents of phenomena were wholly momentary and did not exist in a latent form.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Sthanakvasi sect is indeed a sub-sect within Jainism.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Sautrantika and Sammitiya were Buddhist sects, not Jain. Statement 2 is incorrect; Sarvastivada held that the constituents of phenomena existed in a latent form, even though they were momentary.  The question tests detailed knowledge of religious sects and their philosophical positions.  The distractors involve subtle inaccuracies regarding the philosophical positions of the mentioned schools, demanding precise recall of details.


**8. With reference to the life of the Buddha, consider the following statements:**

1. Buddha gave his first sermon at Kushinagar.
2. His son Rahul was not among his first five disciples.
3. The kingdoms associated with Buddha's life included Avanti and Gandhara.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Rahul, Buddha's son, was not among his initial five disciples. Statement 1 is incorrect; Buddha's first sermon was given at Sarnath, not Kushinagar (where he attained Mahaparinirvana). Statement 3 is also incorrect; while Magadha and Kosala were prominent kingdoms in Buddha's life, Avanti and Gandhara were not as significantly associated. The question tests specific details about Buddha's life, his teachings, and his interactions with various kingdoms.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge by presenting plausible but incorrect associations between events and locations.


**9. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. Mohenjo-daro was the largest site of the Indus Valley Civilization.
2. Lothal is known for its well-planned drainage system and grid-pattern layout.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only

(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Lothal is indeed renowned for its advanced dockyard and urban planning, including a well-designed drainage system. Statement 1 is incorrect; Rakhigarhi is considered the largest Harappan site discovered so far. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Harappans possessed significant metallurgical skills, as evidenced by their copper tools and bronze sculptures.  The question assesses detailed knowledge about the Harappan Civilization, its urban planning, and technological advancements. The distractors use incorrect information about the largest site and the presence of metallurgy, requiring precise knowledge for a correct answer.


**10. With reference to  Indian art and archaeology, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli was made later than the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram.

3. The Ajanta Caves are primarily known for their mural paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves is indeed a product of Gupta period art. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli is significantly older than the Mahabalipuram monuments.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while Ajanta Caves are famous for their murals, they also feature other types of art. The question tests knowledge of Indian art history, chronology, and the characteristics of different art styles. The distractors use misleading information about the chronology of rock-cut art and the primary focus of Ajanta Caves, making it a challenging question.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, rejecting the notion of a single absolute truth.
2.  The concept of "Ratnatraya" (three jewels) in Jainism encompasses Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, representing the path to liberation.
3.  Digambara and Svetambara are the two main sects within Jainism, distinguished primarily by their differing views on monastic practices and the nature of the soul.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect core tenets of Jain philosophy. Anekantavada, the principle of multiple viewpoints, is fundamental to Jain thought, emphasizing that reality is complex and possesses many aspects, thus rejecting simplistic or singular truths.  The concept of "Ratnatraya" (three jewels)—Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct—forms the cornerstone of the Jain path to liberation (moksha).  Finally, the existence of the Digambara and Svetambara sects is a well-established historical fact, with their differences stemming from interpretations of monastic rules, the nature of the soul (whether formless or possessing form), and other aspects of Jain practice.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Four Noble Truths, central to Buddhist philosophy, posit the existence of suffering, its origins in craving, its cessation, and the path to its cessation.
2.  The concept of Nirvana in Buddhism represents a state of liberation from the cycle of rebirth (samsara), achieved through extinguishing craving and attachment.
3.  Theravada Buddhism emphasizes individual enlightenment through monastic practices, while Mahayana Buddhism focuses on universal salvation and the Bodhisattva path.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Four Noble Truths are the foundational teachings of Buddhism, outlining the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. Nirvana, a central concept in Buddhism, denotes a state of liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, achieved by eliminating craving and attachment. The distinction between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism lies in their approaches to enlightenment and salvation; Theravada emphasizes individual liberation through monastic discipline, while Mahayana prioritizes universal salvation and the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals delay their own enlightenment to help others. Thus, all three statements accurately reflect key aspects of Buddhist thought and practice.


**3. With reference to the history of Indian philosophical schools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools, posits a dualistic worldview, distinguishing between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2.  The Yoga school, closely related to Samkhya, emphasizes the integration of physical and mental disciplines (asanas, pranayama, etc.) to achieve liberation.
3.  The Charvaka school, a heterodox school, advocates a materialistic philosophy, rejecting the concepts of an afterlife, karma, and the authority of the Vedas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Samkhya school, a prominent orthodox school of Indian philosophy, is characterized by its dualistic ontology, distinguishing between Purusha (pure consciousness) and Prakriti (primal matter). The Yoga school, often considered a practical application of Samkhya, emphasizes the use of various techniques, including asanas and pranayama, to achieve union between Purusha and Prakriti, leading to liberation.  The Charvaka school, belonging to the heterodox tradition, stands in stark contrast to the orthodox schools, advocating a materialistic worldview that rejects metaphysical concepts like an afterlife, karma, and the authority of the Vedas.  Therefore, all three statements correctly represent these different schools of Indian thought.


**4. With reference to ancient Indian religious movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ajivikas, a Shramana tradition, adhered to a deterministic philosophy, believing in the absolute predestination of all events and denying free will.
2.  The Ajnanas, another Shramana tradition, were known for their radical skepticism, asserting the impossibility of attaining reliable knowledge about the world.
3.  Both Ajivikas and Ajnanas, alongside Jainism and Buddhism, are classified under the Nastika (heterodox) schools of Indian philosophy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ajivikas, a significant ancient Indian religious movement, were characterized by their deterministic philosophy, believing that all events are predetermined by fate (niyati) and denying individual agency. The Ajnanas, another Shramana tradition, are notable for their radical skepticism, questioning the possibility of acquiring certain knowledge. Both Ajivikas and Ajnanas, along with Jainism and Buddhism, are classified as Nastika (heterodox) schools, distinguishing them from the six orthodox schools that accept the authority of the Vedas.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate descriptions of these less-known but historically important religious and philosophical traditions.


**5. With reference to the features of Jain religious practices, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sallekhana, a practice involving voluntary fasting to death, is considered a form of religious devotion by Jains, although its legality has been debated.

3.  The Jain flag displays five colors representing the Pancha-Parameshthi (five-fold hierarchy of religious authorities) and a swastika symbolizing the cycle of rebirth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting unto death, is a controversial yet recognized aspect of Jain religious practice, viewed by some as a form of self-sacrifice and devotion.  Pratikraman, a daily ritual of confession and self-examination, is a central practice aimed at acknowledging and repenting for past misdeeds, thus purifying karma.  The Jain flag indeed incorporates five colors representing the Pancha-Parameshthi, a hierarchy of religious leaders, and a swastika that symbolizes the cycle of rebirth and the soul's journey.  Thus, all three statements accurately reflect specific aspects of Jain religious practices and symbolism.

The Ramanuja Sampradaya is known for its Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) philosophy, which emphasizes a unique relationship between the individual soul (jivatman) and the supreme being (Brahman).  Madhvacharya's Madhva Sampradaya is characterized by its Dvaita (dualistic) philosophy, asserting a clear distinction between Brahman and individual souls.  Vallabhacharya's Pushti Marg Sampradaya centers on a devotional path emphasizing pure love and service (seva) towards Lord Krishna. Therefore, all three statements correctly identify and describe key features of these important Vaishnava schools.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Nathpanthi tradition, a significant branch of Shaivism, is closely associated with figures like Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath, emphasizing Hatha Yoga practices and techniques for self-realization.  Lingayatism, a distinct Shaivite tradition, notably rejects the authority of the Vedas and the traditional caste system.  The Aghori tradition, a highly ascetic and often misunderstood branch of Shaivism, centers on the worship of Shiva in his Bhairava form, involving practices often considered extreme.  Thus, all three statements offer accurate descriptions of these distinct Shaivite traditions.


**8.  With reference to the different schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Madhyamaka school, associated with Nagarjuna, is a Mahayana school that emphasizes the concept of Sunyata (emptiness), asserting the lack of inherent existence in phenomena.
2.  The Yogacara school, also a Mahayana school, focuses on the mind-only theory, proposing that all reality is a manifestation of consciousness.
3.  Theravada Buddhism, often considered the oldest surviving branch of Buddhism, emphasizes the attainment of individual Nirvana through monastic discipline and the practice of the Eightfold Path.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Madhyamaka school, a significant Mahayana Buddhist school, is closely linked to Nagarjuna and his concept of Sunyata (emptiness), which posits that phenomena lack inherent existence.  The Yogacara school, another prominent Mahayana school, is known for its mind-only theory, suggesting that all experience arises from consciousness.  Theravada Buddhism, widely considered the oldest surviving branch, emphasizes individual enlightenment through monastic practice and adherence to the Eightfold Path.  Therefore, all three statements correctly represent essential aspects of these distinct Buddhist schools.


**9. With reference to the evolution of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first Buddhist council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, focused primarily on the standardization and preservation of the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules).
2.  The second Buddhist council, marked by internal disputes, resulted in schisms and the emergence of different Buddhist schools or sects.
3.  The fourth Buddhist council, held under the patronage of King Kanishka, led to a significant division within Buddhism, resulting in the emergence of Mahayana and Hinayana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first Buddhist council, convened soon after the Buddha's passing, primarily focused on the compilation and standardization of the Vinaya Pitaka, which details monastic rules and discipline.  The second council is historically linked to internal disagreements and disputes within the Buddhist Sangha, leading to the emergence of different schools of Buddhist thought.  The fourth council, held under the patronage of King Kanishka, is often associated with the significant division between Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism, although the exact nature and extent of this division remain subjects of scholarly debate.  Therefore, all three statements offer accurate, albeit nuanced, historical accounts of important events in the evolution of Buddhism.

3.  The Kanheri Caves, located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, are known for their elaborate rock-cut architecture and significant Buddhist sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is a significant Buddhist pilgrimage site, marking the location where Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vikramshila Mahavihara was located in present-day Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh. While it was indeed renowned for its focus on Tantric teachings and Vajrayana Buddhism, its geographical location is wrongly stated.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kanheri Caves in Mumbai are a notable group of rock-cut caves showcasing intricate Buddhist architecture and sculptures. They represent a significant aspect of Buddhist history and art in Western India.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccurate placement of Vikramshila and the inclusion of the false statement.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**2. With reference to major Jain pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Palitana temples, situated on Shatrunjay hills in Gujarat, are primarily dedicated to Rishabha, the 24th Tirthankara.
2.  Shikharji in Jharkhand is considered one of the holiest sites in Jainism, believed to be where 20 Tirthankaras attained Moksha.
3.  The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, Rajasthan, are renowned for their intricate marble carvings and are exclusively dedicated to Digambara sect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Palitana temples are indeed located on Shatrunjay hills in Gujarat and are highly significant, they are primarily dedicated to Rishabha, the *first* Tirthankara, not the 24th.

Statement 2 is correct. Shikharji in Jharkhand is a highly revered site in Jainism, believed to be the place where 20 Tirthankaras attained Moksha (liberation).

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Dilwara temples are indeed known for their exquisite marble carvings, but they are not exclusively dedicated to the Digambara sect; they are associated with the Svetambara sect.

Thus, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Jain pilgrimage sites and their specific religious associations, challenging the candidate to differentiate between closely related but ultimately incorrect facts.


**3. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the arch and dome became a prominent feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, replacing the traditional trabeate style.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Indo-Islamic architecture is characterized by the widespread adoption of arches and domes, a significant departure from the earlier trabeate style prevalent in Indian architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. Pietra dura, a sophisticated inlay technique using semiprecious stones, was indeed extensively used in Mughal architecture, reaching its zenith during the reign of Shah Jahan, as seen in the Taj Mahal.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Charbagh style of gardening is a prominent feature of Persian and later Indo-Islamic gardens, its origins are not solely attributed to India during the Delhi Sultanate.  The style has roots in ancient Persia and was adapted and refined in India.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of architectural styles and techniques in India, requiring them to distinguish between accurate and partially accurate statements.


**4. With reference to the cultural history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayatan style of temple architecture, characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, is predominantly associated with the Nagara style.
2.  The term 'Derasar' is used to refer to Jain temples primarily in Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan, while in Karnataka, they are known as 'Basadis'.
3.  The 'Ibadat Khana' at Fatehpur Sikri was primarily used as a private prayer chamber for Emperor Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayatan style of temple architecture, with its central and four subsidiary shrines, is a key characteristic of the Nagara style of temple architecture, particularly prevalent in North India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The terms 'Derasar' (Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan) and 'Basadis' (Karnataka) are indeed regionally specific terms used to denote Jain temples.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri was not primarily Akbar's private prayer chamber; it was a hall where he held discussions with scholars of various religions, fostering religious debates and dialogues.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of architectural styles, regional terminology, and historical events, demanding precise recall of facts to arrive at the correct answer.

3. The Lalitavistara Sutra, a Mahayana text, primarily focuses on the childhood and early life of Buddha up to his renunciation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Milinda Panha, also known as the Questions of King Milinda, is a significant Pali text featuring a philosophical dialogue between King Menander I and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Mahavamsa is a Pali chronicle that details the history of Sri Lanka, including accounts related to Buddhism and the island's rulers.

Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. The Lalitavistara Sutra does cover Buddha's early life, but it also extends significantly beyond his renunciation, encompassing his path to enlightenment and teachings.  The statement oversimplifies the scope of the text to create a distractor.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the content and scope of the respective Buddhist texts.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Buddhist literature and requires careful analysis of the statements' nuances to avoid being misled by partially true but incomplete information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jain Agamas are indeed sacred texts containing Tirthankara teachings, they were primarily compiled in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, not Sanskrit.  The use of Sanskrit is a later development.

Statement 2 is correct. Acharya Kundkunda is a well-known Jain scholar whose works, Samayasara and Niyamasara, explore core Jain philosophical concepts.

Statement 3 is correct. Silappadikaram, authored by Ilango Adigal, is a significant Tamil epic that delves into moral and ethical themes, reflecting Jain values and viewpoints. Although its authorship is debated and not exclusively Jain, it holds significance within Jain literary tradition.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The question tests knowledge of Jain literary traditions and the languages used, demanding precise recall of details and an understanding of the broader context of Jain literary influences.


**7. With reference to Zoroastrian literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Avesta, the most important Zoroastrian text, was compiled in its final form during the Sassanian period in the 4th century CE and is written in Avestan language, similar to Sanskrit.
2. The Denkard, a collection of books considered an encyclopedia of Zoroastrianism, holds a divine status comparable to the Avesta.
3.  The Gathas, comprising 17 hymns within the Yasna section of the Avesta, are believed to be the oldest parts of the text and are attributed to Zoroaster himself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Avesta, the central sacred text of Zoroastrianism, was indeed compiled in its final form during the Sassanian period (around the 4th century CE), and the Avestan language, while now extinct, does share linguistic similarities with Sanskrit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Denkard, while a valuable collection of Zoroastrian texts and considered an encyclopedia, does not hold the same divine status as the Avesta, which is considered the primary sacred scripture.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gathas, a collection of hymns within the Yasna, are generally considered the oldest parts of the Avesta and are traditionally attributed to Zoroaster himself.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of Zoroastrian religious texts, their historical context, and their relative importance within the religious tradition.


**8. With reference to Sikh literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Adi Granth, compiled by Bhai Gurdas under the patronage of Guru Arjan Dev, contains the teachings of Sikh Gurus and 15 Bhagats from various religious backgrounds.
2. The Guru Granth Sahib, the final and most sacred Sikh scripture, was compiled in 1678 by Guru Gobind Singh and is written entirely in Gurmukhi script using only Punjabi vocabulary.

Statement 1 is correct. The Adi Granth, compiled under Guru Arjan Dev's guidance (Bhai Gurdas played a significant role), does indeed include the teachings of Sikh Gurus and various Bhagats representing diverse religious traditions (Hindu and Sufi).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Guru Granth Sahib was expanded and finalized under Guru Gobind Singh, it wasn't compiled solely by him.  Its language, Sant Bhasha, is a blend of several languages, not just Punjabi.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The authorship and canonical status of the Dasam Granth are highly debated within Sikhism; it's not universally accepted as an authoritative scripture on par with the Guru Granth Sahib.

Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate. This question tests detailed knowledge of Sikh religious texts, their compilation, and their status within the Sikh faith, highlighting the complexities and debates surrounding certain scriptures.


**9. With reference to Tamil Sangam literature, consider the following statements:**

1. Sangam literature is a collection of poems primarily written in Tamil, dating back to the Sangam period (roughly 300 BCE – 300 CE).
2. The term 'Sangam' refers to literary assemblies held in the Pandya kingdom, where poets and writers gathered to share and compile their works.
3.  Sangam literature predominantly focuses on 'Aham' themes, which deal with personal and romantic relationships, with very little focus on 'Puram' themes which concern social, political, and heroic narratives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sangam literature is a collection of Tamil poems that originated during the Sangam period (approximately 300 BCE to 300 CE).

Statement 2 is correct. The term 'Sangam' refers to the literary assemblies held in the Pandya kingdom where poets gathered to compose and share their works.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While 'Aham' (personal and romantic themes) is a significant aspect, Sangam literature also encompasses 'Puram' (social, political, and heroic narratives), providing a broader view of the society and its values.  The statement creates a misleading impression by minimizing the importance of Puram.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.  The question demands a nuanced understanding of Tamil Sangam literature, its historical context, and the balance between its diverse thematic concerns.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival in India directly led to the widespread adoption of the arch and dome in Indian architecture, replacing pre-existing styles.
2. The Timurid dynasty, established by Babur, immediately implemented uniform administrative systems across the entire Indian subcontinent.
3.  Babur's forces were the first to introduce gunpowder weaponry to the Indian subcontinent, revolutionizing warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's arrival did contribute to the further development and spread of arch and dome architecture in India, the assertion that it *directly led* to the *widespread adoption* and *replacement* of pre-existing styles is inaccurate.  Arch and dome structures existed in India before Babur's arrival, notably in pre-Islamic architecture and during the Delhi Sultanate period.  Babur's architectural legacy was influential, but it didn't entirely replace existing styles. The statement oversimplifies a complex architectural evolution.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Babur established the Mughal dynasty, not the Timurid dynasty in India.  The Timurids were his ancestral lineage.  Moreover, the implementation of uniform administrative systems was a gradual process across the subcontinent, spanning centuries and multiple Mughal rulers, not an immediate consequence of Babur's conquest. The statement presents a significantly oversimplified and inaccurate view of the Mughal administrative expansion.


Statement 3 is correct.  Babur's armies did introduce more sophisticated gunpowder weaponry and tactics to the Indian subcontinent, significantly impacting warfare. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur's arrival, the Mughal armies' use of cannons and other artillery represented a substantial advancement, contributing to their military successes.  This statement accurately reflects a key aspect of Babur's military influence.


**2. With reference to Indian art and archaeological history, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.
2. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves is a later example of Indian rock-cut sculpture than the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
3. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli showcases artistic elements significantly different from the later rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, a prominent example of Kalinga architecture, dates back to the 11th century CE. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, created by the Pallava dynasty, primarily belong to the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Therefore, the Lingaraja Temple is indeed older.


Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha image at the Udayagiri Caves, attributed to the Gupta period, dates to the 5th century CE. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE).  Thus, the Varaha image is considerably later.


Statement 3 is correct. While both the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli and the Mahabalipuram monuments are rock-cut sculptures, they exhibit distinct artistic styles reflecting different periods and patronage. The Dhauli elephant is associated with the austere style of the Mauryan period, while Mahabalipuram demonstrates a more elaborate, expressive style characteristic of the Pallava period.  The stylistic differences are significant and reflect the evolution of sculptural traditions.

Omkareshwar, a significant Shiva temple, is indeed located in the Satmala Hills in Madhya Pradesh, while Srisailam, dedicated to Mallikarjuna, is situated in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh. This statement correctly identifies the geographical location of these important pilgrimage sites.

Statement 2 is correct. Pushkar, famed for its Brahma temple, is located in the Aravalli Range of Rajasthan. The Aravalli Range's geographical characteristics have played a crucial role in shaping the town's layout, water resources, and overall development.  The statement accurately identifies the location and its geographical context.

Statement 3 is correct. The geographical settings of pilgrimage sites have profoundly influenced their architectural styles, construction materials, and the development of associated cultural traditions.  The availability of local stone, water sources, and the surrounding landscape have all contributed to the unique characteristics of these places. This statement correctly highlights the significant interplay between geography and cultural development in the context of pilgrimage sites.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  'Panchayatan' does not refer to a specific religious sect. It's an architectural style that was used in the construction of both Hindu and Jain temples across different regions of India.  The statement incorrectly defines Panchayatan as a religious sect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Panchayatan style is more prominent in certain regions, it was used in both North and South India, making the statement about its exclusive usage in the South inaccurate. The statement makes an incorrect generalization about the geographical distribution of this architectural style.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Chaityas were primarily assembly halls or places of worship, featuring a stupa at one end, while Viharas served as residential quarters for Buddhist monks. This statement correctly distinguishes the functions of these two types of structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The distinction between Chaityas and Viharas is not solely based on size. While size can vary, the fundamental difference lies in their purpose: worship versus residence.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate basis for differentiation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While both Chaityas and Viharas often included carvings, the architectural features differed significantly. Chaityas featured a stupa and were designed for congregational worship, while Viharas had cells for monks and were arranged for communal living.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's introduction of gunpowder weaponry significantly altered warfare tactics in India.  While gunpowder existed in India prior to Babur's arrival, his campaigns brought in more advanced weaponry and tactics.

Statement 2 is correct. Babur established the Timurid dynasty in India, laying the foundation for the Mughal Empire. This dynasty's influence on art, architecture, and administration was profound and long-lasting.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Timurids, including Babur, utilized arches and domes in their architecture, the widespread adoption of these elements in India was a gradual process influenced by various pre-existing regional styles and later Mughal architectural developments. The assertion that Babur's influence was the *sole* cause is an oversimplification.  The arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture, though their usage and style might have been refined and adapted by later rulers.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is considerably older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallavas during the 7th century CE.  Therefore, they are not contemporary.

3.  Babur's introduction of gunpowder warfare in India resulted in an immediate and decisive shift in military technology across the subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. While Babur's arrival did influence Indian architecture and warfare, the statements oversimplify the complexities of these historical transitions.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before Babur's arrival, albeit in different styles and forms.  Babur's reign saw the introduction of Central Asian architectural elements, leading to a fusion, not a complete replacement.  Pre-existing architectural traditions continued to exert influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect as the establishment of the Mughal dynasty under Babur built upon pre-existing political realities and power structures in India.  It wasn't a complete break, but rather a significant shift in the balance of power.  The existing social and political landscape significantly influenced the Mughal rise.

Statement 3 is an overstatement. Although Babur's forces utilized gunpowder weaponry, its adoption wasn't immediate or universally decisive across the entire subcontinent.  The impact of gunpowder technology unfolded gradually, integrating with and affecting existing military practices over time.  Other factors, such as political alliances and local resistance, played a crucial role in shaping military outcomes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, which dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE).  This represents a considerable chronological gap in the development of Indian art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, while a fine example of Nagara style, is considerably later than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram (7th century CE).  The Mahabalipuram structures represent the Dravidian style.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While the Mahabalipuram monuments are significant examples of early Dravidian architecture, they don't represent the culmination or most refined form of the style.  Dravidian architecture evolved and developed considerably over many centuries after the creation of the Mahabalipuram structures.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan is a well-known architectural style, particularly in North Indian temple architecture, where a central deity is surrounded by four other smaller shrines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Panchayats are village councils, the term 'Panchayatan' itself does not refer to a governance structure.  The term is specifically related to temple architecture.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While Panchayatan's origins might be rooted in symbolic representations of cosmological concepts, it's primarily known for its architectural significance and not specifically linked to Vedic rituals in the manner described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the exact nature of Indus religion is still debated, archaeological evidence suggests the worship of both male and female deities.  Interpretations of artifacts are varied and ongoing, but the idea of a solely male deity is an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While horses were present in the Indus region, there's limited conclusive evidence of widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare.  Archaeological interpretations are complex and don't support a definitive claim of extensive use in warfare.

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Satavahanas are known for their Rupaka silver coinage. The Western Kshatrapas frequently used the Ujjain symbol on their silver coins.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Akbar did introduce the Ilahi coins, reflecting his syncretic religious policies.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Humayun's reign was marked by instability and loss of territory, not expansion. He lost much of the territory won by Babur.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The Taj Mahal was constructed during Shah Jahan's reign, not Jahangir's.  Jahangir was a patron of the arts, but the Taj Mahal was not built during his rule.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are largely correct. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription is primarily associated with Samudragupta's reign, providing valuable information about his conquests and administrative policies.  It is a key source for understanding the Gupta Empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the inscription is a significant historical source, it is primarily associated with Samudragupta's reign and does not offer detailed information about the social and economic conditions of the Gupta period in the way that other sources do.  The script is not Brahmi; it's a form of  Prakrit.




**1. With reference to the arrival of Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival marked the introduction of gunpowder warfare on a large scale in the Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was significantly introduced to India through Babur's patronage.
3. Babur's conquest directly led to the establishment of the Mughal dynasty, which would rule for over three centuries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur, his campaigns marked a significant shift towards its widespread use in warfare, changing the balance of power in the region.  Statement 2 is also correct. Babur, being a Timurid, brought with him the architectural traditions of his lineage, including the prominent use of arches and domes, influencing subsequent Mughal architecture. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Babur laid the foundation for the Mughal Empire, the dynasty's formal establishment and consolidation took place under his successors, notably Humayun and Akbar. The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process of conquest and consolidation.  The Mughal dynasty’s emergence wasn't a direct, immediate consequence of Babur's arrival but rather a gradual process spanning several generations. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, a prominent example of Kalinga architecture, predates the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, showcasing Pallava artistry, were constructed before the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves.
3. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, associated with the Mauryan period, represents the earliest surviving example of monumental stone sculpture amongst the given options.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later, primarily during the 11th-13th centuries CE. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, belonging to the Gupta period (5th century CE), postdates the Pallava rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram (7th-9th centuries CE).  Statement 3 is correct.  The Dhauli rock-cut elephant is the earliest among the options provided, representing the Mauryan period's artistic and technological achievements in monumental stone sculpture. Thus, only statement 3 accurately reflects the chronology of these significant works of art.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Srisailam, a significant pilgrimage site, is indeed located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh. Omkareshwar, another important pilgrimage center in Madhya Pradesh, is situated on an island in the Narmada River, a geographical detail that makes statement 2 incorrect.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. Srisailam is primarily associated with Lord Shiva, while Omkareshwar is dedicated to Lord Shiva (as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas), not Lord Vishnu. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the geographical and religious associations of these pilgrimage sites.  The other statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the locations and presiding deities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery is located in Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh, and the Alchi Temple Complex is in Ladakh. Statement 2 is also incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayatan style is a distinct architectural feature of certain Hindu temples, characterized by the arrangement of five shrines. Statement 2 is incorrect. Panchayatan refers to an architectural style, not a religious sect or philosophical school. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Varaha image at Udayagiri is a significant sculpture, it's not an example of a Panchayatan temple;  Panchayatan describes the layout of multiple shrines within a temple complex, not a single sculpture. Therefore, only statement 1 correctly describes the Panchayatan style.

The massive Varaha avatar sculpture is found at Udayagiri Caves, not Ajanta. Statement 3 is correct. Mamallapuram is indeed famous for its rock-cut sculptures depicting Arjuna's penance and the Descent of the Ganga.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did use the Ibadat Khana for personal reflection, its primary function was as a space for religious discussions.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana was a central location for Akbar's dialogues with scholars from different religious backgrounds. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Ibadat Khana was not exclusively used by the royal family; it hosted gatherings that included scholars and representatives from various faiths.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar Caves, dating back to the Mauryan period, predate the Badami Caves, which were constructed during the Chalukya period. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami Caves are ancient and significant, they are not the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India; the Barabar Caves hold that distinction. Statement 3 is correct. The Ellora Caves are a remarkable example of rock-cut architecture representing a blend of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain traditions. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

While the Indus people demonstrated sophisticated urban planning, the evidence for grand palaces and temples comparable to later periods is limited or debated amongst scholars. Statement 3 is incorrect.  There's no conclusive evidence of widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in Indus warfare; the presence of horses itself is a matter of ongoing scholarly discussion.  Therefore, only statement 1 is definitively supported by current archaeological evidence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the coinage practices of the mentioned dynasties.  The Satavahanas are indeed known for their predominantly lead coinage, with silver being less common. While aesthetically simple, these coins are crucial for understanding their dynastic history. The Gupta period saw a significant shift towards gold coinage, marking a period of economic prosperity and artistic flourishing, with the introduction of Sanskrit inscriptions signifying a shift in cultural expression. Finally, the Western Satraps' coinage, as described, often combined royal imagery with Buddhist symbols, reflecting the religious landscape of the time and their interaction with existing cultural traditions.

All three statements are accurate representations of early Indian numismatic history. The Ujjain symbol is a well-documented feature of Satavahana coins, providing a consistent visual element alongside animal depictions. The widespread use of cowrie shells as a parallel currency system to coins is a well-established fact, particularly for everyday transactions among the populace.  Finally, the Kushan empire's influence on the coinage of surrounding regions is historically significant, leading to a wider adoption of coin-making practices. Thus, option (d) accurately reflects the historical evidence. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

This shift facilitated wider appeal and dissemination of the faith.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverged from the early Theravada tradition, incorporating new scriptures, concepts (like Bodhisattvas), and practices. It's characterized by a more expansive and inclusive approach to Buddhist teachings, rather than a strict adherence to the original canon.
