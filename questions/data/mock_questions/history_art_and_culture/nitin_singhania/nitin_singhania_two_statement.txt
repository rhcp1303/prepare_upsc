**1. With reference to the coinage practices of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire primarily used gold for its higher denomination coins, while silver and copper were used for fractional units and everyday transactions respectively.
2.  The designs on Vijayanagara coins exclusively featured Hindu deities, reflecting the empire's strong religious affiliations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Vijayanagara Empire's coinage system prioritized gold for its higher denomination coins, such as pagodas, which were used for significant transactions.  Silver and copper were indeed employed for lower denominations (fanams and taras) and everyday transactions, showcasing a tiered monetary system common in many historical empires. The statement accurately reflects this hierarchy in the use of precious metals.

Statement 2, however, is inaccurate. While Hindu deities were indeed depicted on some Vijayanagara coins, this was not exclusive.  The coinage also featured symbols like the double-headed eagle, bull, elephant, and running warriors with daggers. The diversity in imagery reflects not only religious but also political and symbolic representations, indicating a broader range of influences and motivations behind the coin designs.  The empire's coinage, therefore, wasn't solely dedicated to religious iconography, but incorporated a wider range of symbolic elements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the evolution of Indian music:**

1.  The Natyashastra, written between 200 BC and 200 AD, initially defined swaras as notes associated with Vedic recitation, later evolving into a 22-note scale.
2.  The concept of "Rasa" in Indian classical music encompasses nine distinct emotions, including Shanta (peace) and Bhakti (devotion), with Bhakti emerging as a prominent Rasa after the 15th century.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification. While the Natyashastra does discuss swaras in relation to Vedic recitation, its description of a 22-note scale is a later interpretation. The text itself doesn't explicitly define a precise 22-note scale, leaving room for scholarly debate on its exact structure and the evolution of the swara system.  The statement presents a simplified and potentially misleading view of a complex historical development.

Statement 2, however, is accurate in its core description. The nine Rasas (emotions) of Indian classical music, including Shanta (peace) and Bhakti (devotion), are well-established concepts. The rise of Bhakti movement during and after the 15th century profoundly impacted the cultural landscape, leading to a heightened emphasis on devotional music. This resulted in Bhakti becoming a more prominently featured and explicitly recognized Rasa in many musical traditions, aligning with the statement's assertion.


**3. With reference to the Sangam literature of ancient South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangam period witnessed the organization of three literary assemblies (Sangams) over a span of 600-700 years, with the first two Sangams primarily existing in legendary accounts.
2.  The Sangam literary corpus, comprising approximately 30,000 lines of poetry, is entirely devoid of any references to social hierarchies or material culture.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key aspect of Sangam literature's historical context. The existence of three Sangams over a significant period is widely accepted, although the details of the first two are largely shrouded in myth and legend.  The statement's emphasis on the legendary nature of the early Sangams accurately reflects the scholarly consensus on the available historical evidence.

Statement 2, however, is a gross misrepresentation. While the extent of detail on material culture may vary across different Sangam texts, it is incorrect to claim that these texts are entirely devoid of such references. Sangam literature offers valuable insights into the social fabric of ancient South India, including descriptions of various social classes, occupations, material possessions, and aspects of daily life.  Therefore, the statement's assertion of a complete absence of references to social hierarchies and material culture is demonstrably false.


**4. With reference to early Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Satavahana dynasty primarily utilized lead for its coins, with silver coins being relatively scarce and the Ujjain symbol frequently appearing on their coinage.
2.  The Gupta gold coins, while featuring the king on one side, exclusively depicted Goddess Lakshmi on the other, reflecting the Gupta Empire's strong devotion to the goddess.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the coinage practices of the Satavahana dynasty.  Lead was indeed their predominant metal, with silver coins being less common. The Ujjain symbol, a distinctive cross with four circles, is a well-known feature found on many Satavahana coins, further supporting the accuracy of the statement.  The statement correctly identifies key aspects of Satavahana numismatics.

Statement 2, however, presents an oversimplified view of Gupta coinage. While Gupta gold coins often depicted the king on one side, the reverse side was not exclusively reserved for Goddess Lakshmi.  Other deities like Durga, Ganga, and figures like Garuda and Kartikeya also appeared on the reverse sides.  The statement's claim of exclusive depiction of Lakshmi is therefore inaccurate, showcasing a limited understanding of the diverse iconography present on Gupta coins.


**5. With reference to Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mauryan palaces, exemplified by those at Pataliputra and Kumrahar, were primarily constructed using stone, reflecting the empire's advanced architectural techniques.
2.  The Ashokan pillars, averaging 40 feet in height, typically featured monolithic shafts made of chunar sandstone, with capitals that were either lotus-shaped or bell-shaped, the latter showing Iranian influence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mauryan Empire was undoubtedly architecturally advanced, its palaces were predominantly constructed using wood, not stone. The use of wood was a common practice during that era due to its availability and suitability for large-scale constructions. The statement incorrectly attributes stone as the primary building material for Mauryan palaces, reflecting a misunderstanding of the materials used in Mauryan architecture.

Statement 2, however, is accurate. The Ashokan pillars are well-known for their impressive height and monolithic construction. Chunar sandstone was indeed a favoured material, and the pillars characteristically featured either lotus or bell-shaped capitals, with the bell-shaped capitals showing clear evidence of Iranian artistic influence.  The statement correctly describes the key features of Ashokan pillars, emphasizing their construction and stylistic influences.


**6. With reference to the development of Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nannayya, considered by some linguists to be the first Telugu poet, contributed significantly to the flourishing of Telugu literature during the Vijayanagara period, which is known as the golden age of Telugu literature.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya, the Vijayanagara emperor, was a patron of various languages, including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, and Sanskrit, and his court included eight prominent Telugu poets known as the Ashtadiggajas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but requires clarification. While Nannayya is indeed considered by some to be a pioneering figure in Telugu literature, attributing the flourishing of Telugu literature solely to him during the Vijayanagara period is an oversimplification.  Telugu literature had a rich history before the Vijayanagara period and continued to develop after it.  The statement presents an incomplete and potentially inaccurate perspective on the evolution of Telugu literature.

Statement 2 is accurate. Krishna Deva Raya's patronage of multiple languages, including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, and Sanskrit, is well-documented. His court was indeed home to eight notable Telugu poets, collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas, showcasing his significant contribution to the literary scene of his time. The statement accurately highlights Krishna Deva Raya's role as a key patron of Telugu literature and the existence of the Ashtadiggajas.


**7. Consider the following statements about the features of Indian folk theatre:**

1.  Ankia Naat, a traditional one-act play from Assam, uses masks to depict specific expressions and is performed in Brajavali, a mixed Assamese-Maithili language.
2.  Ramlila, a folk theatre form primarily associated with Uttar Pradesh, features predominantly female actors who enact the roles of both male and female characters from the Ramayana.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key aspect of Ankia Naat.  The use of masks to convey emotions and the use of Brajavali (a mixed Assamese-Maithili language) are indeed integral to this traditional Assamese theatre form. The statement accurately reflects the stylistic and linguistic features of Ankia Naat.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While Ramlila is indeed a folk theatre form predominantly found in Uttar Pradesh, it is primarily performed by male actors who take on both male and female roles.  The statement's assertion of predominantly female actors is inaccurate, reflecting a misunderstanding of the traditional gender dynamics in Ramlila performances.  The statement incorrectly assigns a gender role to the actors in Ramlila.


**8. With reference to the development of Indian handicrafts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest material evidence of glass production in India dates back to the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ganges Valley (1000 BC), predating references found in the Mahabharata.
2.  The Mughal period witnessed a flourishing of the glassware industry, with items such as glass hukkas, perfume boxes (ittar dans), and engraved glasses being produced for royal patronage.  The city of Firozabad became famous for glass bangles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Mahabharata mentions glassmaking, the earliest *material* evidence of glass production in India is indeed found in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ganges Valley, dating back to around 1000 BC.  This highlights that archaeological evidence sometimes contradicts or refines literary accounts in providing a more precise timeline of technological developments. The statement correctly prioritizes the archaeological evidence over the literary one.

Statement 2 is partially correct but contains an inaccuracy. While the Mughal period did see a significant development in the glassware industry, with items like glass hukkas, ittar dans, and engraved glasses being produced for the royal court,  Firozabad is primarily known for its glass *bangles*, not for the other items mentioned. The statement incorrectly associates Firozabad with a specific type of glassware.  The statement mixes correct and incorrect information leading to confusion.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, including grid-patterned roads and advanced drainage systems.
2.  Archaeological evidence suggests the Harappan people primarily worshipped a single, male deity, neglecting female deities in their religious practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Harappan civilization is renowned for its remarkably advanced urban planning. Excavations at sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a grid-like street layout, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, indicating a high level of engineering and urban planning skills. This reflects a structured societal organization and advanced understanding of urban infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the interpretation of Harappan religious practices is still debated, evidence suggests a complex religious system involving both male and female deities.  The discovery of numerous figurines representing mother goddesses and the Pashupati seal (often interpreted as a proto-Shiva figure) points to a pantheon of deities, contradicting the notion of a singular male deity.  The absence of clear textual evidence makes definitive conclusions challenging, but the available archaeological findings don't support the claim of exclusive male deity worship.  The complexity of Harappan religion is a significant area of ongoing scholarly discussion and research.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.
2.  The Theravada school of Buddhism is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, sharing its core tenets and practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving enlightenment, choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide others on the path to enlightenment. This selfless compassion and dedication to helping others are key distinctions of Mahayana Buddhism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism are distinct branches of Buddhism, with differing philosophical interpretations and practices.  Theravada, often considered the "older" tradition, emphasizes individual enlightenment and monastic life, adhering more closely to the early teachings of the Buddha. Mahayana, on the other hand, expands on these teachings, incorporating concepts like Bodhisattvas and the potential for universal enlightenment.  While both stem from the Buddha's teachings, they represent separate evolutionary paths within Buddhism.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's architecture is characterized by the extensive use of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) in its temple complexes.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers primarily patronized Jain religious institutions, neglecting Hindu temples in their architectural endeavors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Vijayanagara architectural style is easily recognizable by its inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas within temple complexes. These ornate structures served as wedding pavilions, reflecting the importance of royal patronage and social rituals.  The Vittala Temple at Hampi serves as a prime example of this architectural feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did display religious tolerance, its architectural patronage overwhelmingly favored Hindu temples. The empire's rulers were devout Hindus, and their grand temple complexes at Hampi and other locations are testament to their significant investment in Hindu religious architecture.  While some Jain influence might be present, it was significantly overshadowed by the vast scale of Hindu temple construction.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement saints, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbark, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, was a contemporary of the Mughal emperor Akbar.
2. Saint Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by the Sufi mystic Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the exact dates of Nimbark's life are debated, scholarly consensus places him several centuries before Akbar's reign.  The Bhakti movement spanned several centuries, and Nimbark's contributions predate the Mughal era.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kabir's teachings drew inspiration from various sources, including Hinduism and Sufism, but not directly from Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Sirhindi's influence became prominent later, during the reign of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, while Kabir lived and taught much earlier.  Kabir's syncretic philosophy, blending elements of different traditions, is a defining feature of his work, but Sirhindi's influence is not a significant part of this.


**5. With reference to  Mughal art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts towards individual portraits and album art.
2.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri was constructed primarily using marble and red sandstone.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's patronage significantly shifted the focus towards individual portraits, often showcasing the emperor himself, his family, or court officials.  The detailed and realistic depiction of flora and fauna also became a hallmark of Jahangir's era, culminating in the creation of numerous albums showcasing these individual portraits.  His personal interest in painting further spurred this shift.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Buland Darwaza is primarily made of red sandstone, not marble. The use of red sandstone was a common feature in Mughal architecture, especially during Akbar's reign.  While other materials might be incorporated as embellishments, the main structural material of the Buland Darwaza was red sandstone.


**6. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional variations in Indian temple architecture.
2.  The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is an example of the Dravida style of temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent the three main architectural styles prevalent in different regions of India.  Nagara is associated with North India, Dravida with South India, and Vesara represents a hybrid style found in the Deccan region.  These styles are distinguished by their distinctive features in the shikhara (tower), vimana (sanctum), and other architectural elements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is a prime example of the Nagara style, not the Dravida style.  The Nagara style is characterized by its curvilinear shikhara, while the Dravida style features a pyramidal or stepped shikhara.  The architectural features of the Lingaraja Temple clearly align with the Nagara style's characteristics.


**7. With reference to ancient Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli is an older example of Indian rock-cut architecture compared to the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.
2. The Ajanta Caves are primarily known for their Buddhist mural paintings, while the Elephanta Caves are famous for their Hindu sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, attributed to the Mauryan period, predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were created by the Pallava dynasty centuries later.  This demonstrates the evolution of rock-cut architecture in India, starting with simpler forms during the Mauryan era and progressing to more complex structures in subsequent periods.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ajanta Caves are renowned for their exquisitely preserved Buddhist mural paintings, showcasing the mastery of ancient Indian art.  In contrast, the Elephanta Caves are famous for their large-scale Hindu sculptures, particularly the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) sculpture.  This highlights the diverse religious and artistic expressions present in ancient India.


**8. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed large palaces and temples, showcasing a hierarchical social structure.
2.  Archaeological evidence indicates that the Indus people worshipped both male and female deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning, there is no conclusive evidence of large palaces or temples in the same sense as those found in later civilizations.  The structures identified as "citadels" are believed to have served administrative or public functions rather than solely as residences of rulers or religious centers. The absence of monumental architecture typical of later civilizations suggests a different social structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings, including figurines and seals, strongly suggest the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization. The presence of mother goddess figurines and the Pashupati seal (interpreted by some as a proto-Shiva figure) indicates a complex religious system encompassing both genders.



**9. With reference to  Buddhist rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chaityas were places of worship, while Viharas served as dwelling places for Buddhist monks.
2. The Nasik Caves, a group of Buddhist rock-cut caves, exclusively represent the Hinayana school of Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Chaityas are prayer halls or places of worship, typically featuring a stupa at one end. Viharas, on the other hand, were residential structures providing living quarters for Buddhist monks. This distinction reflects the functional division within monastic complexes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nasik Caves primarily exhibit features of Hinayana Buddhism in their early phases, later additions and carvings reflect the influence of Mahayana Buddhism.  The evolution of Buddhist thought and practices is reflected in the architectural development of the caves over time.


**10. With reference to the Coinage of different dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gupta dynasty's coinage frequently featured the image of a peacock.
2. The Western Chalukya kings commonly used the image of a boar on their coins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gupta dynasty's coinage is known for its artistic merit and often included the image of a peacock.  This reflects the Gupta rulers' patronage of art and their symbolic association with the bird.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Western Chalukya dynasty did use various symbols on their coins, the boar was not a consistently prominent or defining feature of their coinage.  Different symbols were employed during various periods and by different rulers, indicating a more diverse iconography.  Attributing the boar specifically and exclusively to the Western Chalukya coins would be inaccurate.


**11. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Roma people, known as Gypsies in Europe, carried Indian cultural traditions to various parts of Europe and beyond.
2.  The Kalinga dynasty played a significant role in establishing trade relations with Southeast Asian countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Roma people's origins are still under debate but there are some theories that suggest their migration from India to Europe and beyond.  Scholars have found some linguistic and cultural similarities between the Roma and various Indian communities, suggesting a possible link and the transmission of cultural elements through their migrations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kalinga dynasty, based in present-day Odisha, was involved in maritime trade with Southeast Asia. This trade facilitated the exchange of goods and cultural ideas, leading to the spread of Indian cultural influences to the region.  The Kalinga's naval power played a crucial role in this exchange.


**12. With reference to the legal protection of cultural heritage in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution mandates the protection of monuments and objects of national importance.
2.  The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, defines an object as an "antiquity" only if it is at least 100 years old.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution explicitly directs the state to protect and safeguard monuments and objects of national importance.  This reflects the constitutional commitment to preserving India's cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, sets the age threshold for an object to be classified as an "antiquity" at 100 years. This legal definition is crucial for regulating the trade, export, and preservation of ancient artifacts.  This act aims to prevent the illicit trade and smuggling of antiquities.

Statement 2 is correct. Sushruta Samhita is a landmark work in the history of surgery. It provides detailed descriptions of surgical instruments, procedures, and post-operative care, reflecting a high level of surgical knowledge in ancient India.  The text covers various surgical techniques that were remarkably advanced for its time.


**15. With reference to  cultural institutions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is responsible for the preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites, guided by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.
2.  The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) primarily focuses on the promotion and preservation of performing arts, neglecting visual arts in its activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's primary mandate is the preservation and protection of India's ancient monuments and archaeological sites. The 1958 Act provides the legal framework for its operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IGNCA's mandate is broader than just performing arts; it encompasses visual arts, research, documentation, and dissemination of knowledge related to various aspects of Indian culture.  Its activities cover a wide spectrum of cultural expressions.


**1. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine figure.
2.  The path of Bodhisattvas, individuals postponing their own enlightenment to help others, is a central tenet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana Buddhism, a major branch of Buddhism, significantly diverges from Theravada Buddhism in its theological and philosophical approaches.  Statement 1 is accurate because Mahayana Buddhism elevates the Buddha to a divine status, contrasting with Theravada's focus on the Buddha as a historical figure who achieved enlightenment.  The concept of Buddhahood becomes accessible to all beings, not just a select few, under Mahayana.  Statement 2 is also correct as the Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana. Bodhisattvas are beings who have attained enlightenment but choose to delay their entry into Nirvana to assist others on their path to enlightenment. This emphasizes compassion and altruism, core values within Mahayana.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are independently true reflections of Mahayana Buddhist doctrines.  Option (d) is false as it contradicts the established tenets of Mahayana Buddhism.  The emphasis on the Bodhisattva path and the deification of the Buddha are key distinguishing features of Mahayana compared to other Buddhist traditions.


**2. With reference to the Kalyana Mandapas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kalyana Mandapas were primarily found in Chalukya temples, showcasing their architectural prowess.
2.  These structures served as wedding pavilions within temple complexes, reflecting societal norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kalyana Mandapas, meaning "marriage halls" or "wedding pavilions," were significant architectural features within temple complexes, particularly prominent in the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 2 accurately describes their function. These structures were integral parts of larger temple complexes, often elaborately decorated, serving as spaces for wedding ceremonies and other auspicious events.  The location within the temple complex itself highlights the intertwining of religious and social life during that period. Statement 1 is incorrect. While various kingdoms and dynasties contributed to temple architecture, Kalyana Mandapas are most strongly associated with Vijayanagara architecture. The Chalukyas, while known for their significant contributions to temple architecture, did not prominently feature Kalyana Mandapas in their temple designs in the same way the Vijayanagara Empire did. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is factually inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect as statement 2 correctly identifies the function of Kalyana Mandapas.


**3. With reference to the religious figures Saint Nimbark and Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

1.  Saint Nimbark was a contemporary of the Mughal emperor Akbar, influencing the religious climate of his reign.
2.  Saint Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by the Sufi scholar Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements present inaccurate information regarding the historical timelines and influences of these significant religious figures.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Saint Nimbarka's lifespan predates Akbar's reign by several centuries; he is generally placed within the 12th-13th centuries, while Akbar ruled from 1556 to 1605.  Their temporal separation makes the claim of contemporaneity false.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Saint Kabir's philosophy, while exhibiting syncretic elements drawing from both Hinduism and Islam, shows no direct influence from Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Sirhindi's prominent role within the Naqshbandi Sufi order and his activities occurred much later than Kabir's lifetime (Kabir died in the late 15th century, while Sirhindi lived from 1564 to 1624).  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because both statements contain historical inaccuracies. The correct answer is (d) as neither statement accurately reflects the historical context of these religious figures' lives and influences.


**4. With reference to the Mughal emperor who shifted the emphasis in art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar was the first to significantly move away from illustrated manuscripts, focusing on individual portraits.
2.  Emperor Jahangir's reign witnessed a notable shift towards album-style collections and individual portraits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The evolution of Mughal art styles shows a gradual transition in artistic focus. While Akbar's reign saw significant advancements in illustrated manuscripts, it's inaccurate to state he was the *first* to significantly shift away from them.  Mughal art under Akbar was largely characterized by grand, narrative-driven illustrated manuscripts, though portraiture was present. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct.  Jahangir's personal interest in painting and his patronage resulted in a distinct shift.  His reign saw a rise in the popularity of individual portraits, often highly detailed and realistic, showcasing a move towards a more personal and intimate style of artistic expression.  The creation and commissioning of albums, containing collections of individual portraits and paintings, also became a hallmark of his reign. This signifies a departure from the large-scale narrative style of earlier periods. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is historically inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately reflects the artistic changes under Jahangir's patronage.


**5. With reference to Mian Tansen, consider the following statements:**

1.  The title "Mian" was bestowed upon him by Emperor Akbar, reflecting his musical talent.
2.  Mian Tansen's compositions primarily focused on themes unrelated to Hindu deities and temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in the court of Emperor Akbar, is a significant figure in the history of Indian classical music.  Statement 1 is correct.  The title "Mian," a mark of respect and recognition, was indeed conferred upon him by Emperor Akbar, highlighting Tansen's exceptional musical abilities and his prominent position within the Mughal court.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tansen's repertoire was diverse, encompassing compositions for his patrons and exploring various ragas, a significant portion of his work centered on Hindu deities and temples. His dhrupads frequently drew inspiration from Hindu mythology and religious themes, reflecting the cultural syncretism of the Mughal court. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 accurately describes a well-documented aspect of Tansen's life and career. The incorrectness of statement 2 points towards the true answer being (a).


**6.  With reference to the Harappan civilization site, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan site of Sohgaura is known for its significant architectural remains, including a large citadel.
2.  The site of Chanhudaro, in present-day Pakistan, is recognized as a major urban center of the Harappan civilization.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, left behind numerous archaeological sites. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Sohgaura, while an important archaeological site, is not a Harappan site; it's associated with the later Mauryan period and is famous for a copper plate inscription.  It lacks the characteristic urban planning and architectural features of Harappan cities. Statement 2 is correct.  Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, is a well-known and extensively excavated Harappan site. Although smaller than Mohenjo-daro or Harappa, it provides valuable insights into the civilization's craft production, especially bead-making, and its urban layout. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately identifies Chanhudaro as a major Harappan site.


**7. With reference to the relief sculptures and inscriptions mentioning "Ranyo Ashoka," consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kanganahalli relief sculpture is notable for its inscription identifying the figure as "Ranyo Ashoka."
2.  The Sanchi Stupa contains detailed inscriptions explicitly naming King Ashoka and his accomplishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ashoka's reign left an enduring legacy, including various inscriptions and sculptures. Statement 1 is correct.  The Kanganahalli relief sculpture in Karnataka is known for its inscription clearly identifying the depicted figure as "Ranyo Ashoka" (King Ashoka) in Brahmi script. This provides valuable evidence for Ashoka's presence and influence in the region. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sanchi Stupa is a significant Buddhist monument with inscriptions from various periods, it does not contain inscriptions explicitly naming King Ashoka and detailing his accomplishments in the same direct manner as the Kanganahalli sculpture. The Sanchi inscriptions primarily relate to Buddhist themes and later additions. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 correctly points to the Kanganahalli inscription as a key source of evidence for identifying a representation of Ashoka.


**8. With reference to the earliest evidence of silver in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan culture provides the earliest confirmed evidence of silver usage in India.
2. Vedic texts offer substantial evidence for widespread silver usage during the Vedic period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Tracing the early use of silver in India requires careful examination of archaeological and textual evidence. Statement 1 is generally accepted as correct by archaeologists. While the exact extent of silver usage within the Harappan civilization is still being researched, archaeological findings from Harappan sites have yielded artifacts containing silver, providing the earliest concrete evidence of its use in the Indian subcontinent. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vedic texts mention silver, the evidence is primarily literary and not as conclusive or extensive as the archaeological findings from the Harappan period.  The Vedic references do not definitively establish the widespread use of silver to the same degree suggested by the archaeological evidence from Harappan sites.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the archaeological evidence from Harappan sites strongly supports the claim of the earliest confirmed silver usage in India, while the Vedic textual evidence is less definitive.


**9. With reference to the construction of the Gomateshwara statue at Sravanabelagola, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chamundraya, a renowned sculptor, is credited with the creation of the Gomateshwara statue.
2.  The statue's construction was completed during the reign of the Ganga dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gomateshwara statue at Sravanabelagola is a monumental achievement of Jain sculpture. Statement 1 is correct. Chamundraya, a skilled sculptor, is historically credited with the creation of this colossal statue of Gomateshwara, the last Tirthankara of Jainism. Statement 2 is also correct.  The construction of the Gomateshwara statue is associated with the Ganga dynasty's rule in the region.  The patronage and support of the Ganga rulers were crucial to the completion of this massive undertaking. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are historically accurate. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements correctly reflect the historical context of the statue's creation.  The combination of Chamundraya's artistic skill and the Ganga dynasty's patronage resulted in this significant work of art.


**10. With reference to Chanakya's other names, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chanakya is also known by the name Vishnugupta, reflecting his scholarly background.
2.  The name Rajshekhar is another well-established alternative name for Chanakya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Chanakya, the influential advisor to Chandragupta Maurya, is known by multiple names. Statement 1 is correct.  Vishnugupta is a well-documented alternative name for Chanakya, often mentioned in historical texts. This name may reflect his scholarly pursuits and his association with Brahminical traditions.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While various names have been associated with Chanakya over time,  Rajshekhar is not a historically established or widely accepted alternative name. The name Rajshekhar is not associated with Chanakya in any major historical or scholarly accounts. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 is accurate. The historical record clearly supports Vishnugupta as an alternative name for Chanakya, while Rajshekhar lacks such historical support.


**11. With reference to the inscription proving Chandragupta Maurya's control over western India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Junagarh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman I provides evidence of Chandragupta Maurya's rule in western India.
2. Ashoka's Girnar Rock Inscription explicitly mentions Chandragupta Maurya's conquests in the west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Establishing Chandragupta Maurya's extent of control over western India requires careful analysis of available inscriptions. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Junagarh Rock Inscription, while a significant historical record, is associated with Rudradaman I, a later ruler of the Western Kshatrapas. It doesn't offer direct evidence of Chandragupta Maurya's rule in western India. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Ashoka's Girnar Rock Inscription focuses on Ashoka's own edicts and policies; it does not specifically mention Chandragupta Maurya's western conquests.  The inscriptions of Ashoka primarily deal with his own reign and policies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.  Neither inscription provides direct evidence of Chandragupta Maurya's control over western India. The lack of direct evidence in both inscriptions makes the correct answer (d).


**12. With reference to the correctly matched pairs of archaeological sites and their significance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal is correctly identified as an ancient dockyard, reflecting its maritime importance.
2.  Rajgir is correctly associated with the Lion Capital of Ashoka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Matching archaeological sites to their significance requires accurate historical knowledge. Statement 1 is correct.  Lothal is indeed renowned for its well-preserved dockyard, providing strong evidence for its role as a major port city in the Indus Valley Civilization. This highlights the Harappan civilization's sophisticated understanding of maritime trade and engineering. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lion Capital of Ashoka is associated with Sarnath, not Rajgir.  Rajgir holds historical importance as a significant Buddhist site, but the Lion Capital is specifically located at Sarnath, where Buddha delivered his first sermon. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the correct association of Lothal with its dockyard distinguishes it as the only correct pairing.  The misidentification of Rajgir with the Lion Capital highlights the need for precise historical knowledge.


**13. With reference to the Ashokan inscriptions mentioning South Indian kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Third Major Rock Edict contains references to South Indian kingdoms and their interactions with the Mauryan empire.
2. The Ninth Major Rock Edict specifically details administrative policies implemented in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ashoka's edicts provide insights into his reign and policies, but their specific references to South India need careful examination. Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Third Major Rock Edict doesn't explicitly name specific South Indian kingdoms, it includes references to the geographical extent of Ashoka's empire that encompassed parts of South India, indicating his influence and interactions with the region. The details are indirect but suggest his reach. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ninth Major Rock Edict focuses on broader aspects of Ashoka's Dhamma and doesn't specifically detail administrative policies uniquely implemented in South India. The focus is on broader principles. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the Third Major Rock Edict's indirect references to South India make statement 1 partially correct, while statement 2 lacks the specific details claimed.


**14. With reference to the archaeological sites of the Indus Valley Civilization where boat models have been found, consider the following statements:**

1.  Boat models have been discovered at both Harappa and Kotdiji.
2.  Mohenjo-daro is a well-known site where multiple boat models have been unearthed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization's maritime activities are reflected in the discovery of boat models at various sites. Statement 1 is correct.  Boat models have indeed been found at both Harappa and Kotdiji, indicating the importance of riverine and possibly maritime transport within the civilization. These models provide valuable clues about the types of boats used and their construction techniques. Statement 2 is also correct. Mohenjo-daro, one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, has also yielded multiple boat models. These finds further support the understanding of the civilization's engagement with water transportation for trade, communication, and daily life. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are supported by archaeological evidence. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the discovery of boat models at various Indus Valley Civilization sites.


**15. With reference to the matching of ancient Indian administrative terms with their functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Talar correctly corresponds to an officer responsible for night guards.
2.  Baladhipati accurately refers to a village tax collector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Understanding ancient Indian administrative structures requires knowledge of specific terms and their functions. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the exact functions of Talar may vary depending on the context, it's not primarily associated with night guards.  Other terms are more closely linked to night watch functions. Statement 2 is correct.  Baladhipati is accurately described as a village tax collector. This term reflects the administrative structure of collecting taxes at the village level in ancient India. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately matches the administrative term with its function. The misidentification of Talar's function highlights the need for precise knowledge of ancient administrative terms.


**16. With reference to the location of the Harappan site Mandi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mandi is situated in the state of Haryana, known for its significant Harappan settlements.
2.  The state of Gujarat houses the Harappan site Mandi, which is one of the westernmost settlements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Precise geographical location of Harappan sites is crucial for understanding the civilization's distribution. Statement 1 is correct. Mandi, a Harappan site, is indeed located in the state of Haryana, India. This site adds to the understanding of the civilization's geographical reach and settlement patterns in the north-western region. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mandi is not situated in Gujarat; its location is in Haryana.  The westernmost extent of the Harappan civilization is in present-day Pakistan, with various sites located along the Indus River and its tributaries. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the correct location of Mandi in Haryana makes statement 1 accurate, while statement 2 presents a false location.


**17. With reference to the official "Agronomai" during the Mauryan age, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agronomai were primarily responsible for overseeing agricultural production and land revenue collection.
2.  The Agronomai were high-ranking officials involved in military administration and strategic planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the Mauryan administrative system involves knowledge of the functions of specific officials. Statement 1 is correct. The Agronomai in the Mauryan empire were primarily responsible for overseeing agricultural production, land management, and related revenue collection.  This reflects the importance of agriculture and land revenue to the Mauryan economy and state power. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mauryan administration had distinct departments for military affairs, the Agronomai were not directly involved in high-level military administration or strategic planning.  Other officials held those responsibilities. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately describes the primary functions of the Agronomai within the Mauryan administrative structure.  The incorrect association with military administration highlights the need for specific knowledge about Mauryan officials.



**1. With reference to the Babur's arrival in India and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's invasion marked the introduction of gunpowder technology to the Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was significantly influenced by Babur's patronage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur's arrival, his campaigns and the subsequent establishment of the Mughal empire significantly disseminated and advanced its use in warfare and siegecraft across the subcontinent.  The impact on military technology was profound and long-lasting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Babur did appreciate and utilize certain architectural features, attributing the widespread adoption of arches and domes solely to his influence is an oversimplification.  The use of arches and domes was already well-established in various regions of India, particularly in pre-existing Islamic architecture of the Delhi Sultanate period.  The Mughals, including Babur, certainly refined and further developed these styles, but they didn't introduce them.  The evolution of Indo-Islamic architecture was a gradual process influenced by multiple factors and preceding dynasties.  The statement misrepresents the historical development of architectural styles.


**2. With reference to the earliest examples of Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli predates the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar.
2. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves is contemporary with the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, attributed to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which dates back to the 11th-13th centuries CE. This represents a considerable chronological gap, highlighting the evolution of Indian artistic and architectural styles over centuries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th century CE.  Although both fall within the broader period of ancient Indian art, they are not contemporary;  the Pallava works postdate the Gupta works. The significant time difference between the two makes the statement inaccurate.



**3. With reference to places of pilgrimage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills.
2. Pushkar is located in the Mahadeo Hills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Omkareshwar is located on an island in the Narmada River, not in the Satmala Hills.  The statement confuses the geographical location of the pilgrimage site.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Pushkar is situated in the Aravalli Range, not the Mahadeo Hills.  The statement incorrectly assigns the pilgrimage site to a different mountain range.  Both statements demonstrate a misunderstanding of the geographical locations of these important pilgrimage sites.


**4. With reference to Buddhist shrines in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in the Spiti Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is situated in the Spiti Valley, not the Zanskar Valley. The statement mislocates this significant Buddhist site.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Alchi Temple Complex is located in Ladakh, not the Spiti Valley. The statement incorrectly places the temple complex in a different region of the Himalayas.  Both statements incorrectly identify the geographical location of these important Buddhist sites.



**5. With reference to the term "Panchayatan" in Indian cultural history, consider the following statements:**

1. Panchayatan refers to a specific style of temple architecture characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.
2.  The term Panchayatan exclusively denotes an assembly of village elders in ancient Indian administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan is a well-known architectural style prevalent in many Hindu temples, particularly those built in North India. The characteristic arrangement of five shrines – one central and four smaller ones at the cardinal directions – reflects a significant aspect of temple design and religious symbolism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While village councils ("panchayats") played a vital role in ancient Indian governance, the term "Panchayatan" specifically refers to the architectural style. The statement attempts to conflate a distinct architectural concept with a separate administrative structure.  The statement incorrectly connects an architectural term to a completely different aspect of Indian history and society.


**6. With reference to famous works of sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is found at Mamallapuram.
2. Arjuna's Penance is a renowned rock-cut sculpture at Ajanta.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The famous depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is located at Ajanta Caves, not Mamallapuram. The statement incorrectly associates this significant Buddhist sculpture with a different site known for its Pallava rock-cut architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Arjuna's Penance is a famous rock-cut relief at Mahabalipuram, not Ajanta. The statement incorrectly assigns this renowned sculpture to the Ajanta Caves, which are predominantly known for their Buddhist cave paintings. Both statements wrongly associate these well-known sculptures with incorrect locations.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as a private prayer chamber for Emperor Akbar.
2.  The Ibadat Khana served as a venue for religious discussions between Akbar and scholars from various faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar may have used the Ibadat Khana for personal prayer, its primary function was as a space for religious discussions and debates. The statement oversimplifies the complex religious policies of Akbar.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana was central to Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and dialogue.  He regularly convened meetings with scholars from diverse religious backgrounds—Hindu, Jain, Zoroastrian, Christian, and others—to engage in intellectual discussions and explore common ground. This reflects a significant aspect of Akbar's reign.  The statement correctly highlights the Ibadat Khana's role in fostering religious debate and understanding.


**8. With reference to the history of Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves were originally constructed for the Ajivikas by Emperor Ashoka.
2. The caves at Badami are among the earliest surviving rock-cut caves in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves, known for their unique rock-cut architecture, were indeed constructed for the Ajivikas during the Mauryan period, specifically under Chandragupta Maurya (not Ashoka).  This demonstrates the patronage of different religious groups by early Indian rulers and the advanced rock-cutting techniques of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant rock-cut structures, they are not among the earliest surviving examples in India. The Barabar caves predate them considerably.  The statement misrepresents the chronology of rock-cut cave construction in India.


**9. With reference to mural paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Ajanta Caves are renowned for their extensive and well-preserved mural paintings.
2.  The Lepakshi temple is primarily known for its intricate stone carvings rather than its mural paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta Caves are world-famous for their exquisite and remarkably well-preserved murals, which represent a high point of ancient Indian painting and provide invaluable insights into Buddhist art and culture.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Lepakshi temple possesses some wall paintings, it is far more celebrated for its impressive and detailed stone carvings. The statement correctly identifies the temple's primary artistic feature. Both statements accurately reflect the artistic characteristics of the mentioned sites.


**10. With reference to the characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization possessed grand palaces and temples comparable in scale to those of later civilizations.
2.  Evidence suggests the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning and impressive engineering feats, the evidence for large-scale palaces and temples comparable to those of later periods is limited and debated.  The statement overstates the existing archaeological evidence.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological discoveries, including seals and figurines, indicate the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The statement correctly reflects the religious practices of this ancient civilization.  The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the religious beliefs of the Indus Valley Civilization.


**11. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut caves in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Chaityas were primarily used as dwelling places for monks.
2. Viharas functioned as places of worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Chaityas were primarily places of worship, typically featuring a stupa at one end. The statement confuses the function of Chaityas with that of Viharas.

Statement 2 is correct. Viharas were monastic dwelling places for Buddhist monks. The statement correctly identifies the primary function of Viharas.  The statement accurately differentiates the functions of the two types of Buddhist rock-cut caves.


**12. With reference to the three main styles of Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara are the three main styles of Indian temple architecture.
2. The three main styles of Indian temple architecture are primarily distinguished by their geographical distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara are indeed the three major styles of Indian temple architecture, each with its distinct characteristics in terms of structure, ornamentation, and iconography.

Statement 2 is correct.  While regional variations existed within each style, the three main styles are largely identified with specific geographical regions: Nagara in North India, Dravida in South India, and Vesara in the transitional zone between North and South India.  The statement correctly identifies a key factor in classifying these architectural styles. Both statements accurately describe the three main styles of Indian temple architecture and their characteristics.


**13. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly a secular civilization with limited evidence of religious dominance.
2.  Cotton cultivation and textile production were significant aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While religious elements were present, the Indus Valley Civilization doesn't show the same level of overt religious monumentality or iconography as later civilizations.  The emphasis on urban planning and sanitation suggests a secular focus.

Statement 2 is correct.  Evidence suggests that cotton cultivation and textile production were important economic activities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The statement correctly reflects the economic activities of this ancient civilization. Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.

2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was substantially introduced and popularized in India following Babur's conquest.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Babur's invasion of India in 1526 marked a significant shift in the subcontinent's military landscape. His army's effective use of gunpowder weaponry, particularly cannons and firearms, proved decisive in several key battles, contributing substantially to the decline of established powers like the Lodis and paving the way for the Mughal Empire.  While gunpowder was known in India prior to Babur's arrival, his campaigns showcased its transformative potential on a large scale, leading to its widespread adoption and influencing subsequent military strategies.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

Furthermore, Babur's Timurid heritage significantly impacted Indian architecture. The Timurids were renowned for their mastery of arch and dome construction, techniques they had inherited and further developed from Central Asian and Persian traditions. Babur's building projects and the architectural styles favored by his successors laid the groundwork for the characteristic Mughal architectural style that would dominate the subcontinent for centuries to come. This style, with its elegant arches and imposing domes, became a distinguishing feature of Mughal architecture, profoundly altering the landscape of Indian urban spaces and religious structures. Consequently, statement 2 is also correct.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, is a Mauryan-era monument dating back to the 3rd century BCE, significantly predating the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later, primarily between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. The rock-cut elephant exemplifies the early Indian tradition of monumental sculpture within a religious context, while the Lingaraja Temple represents a later, more developed style of temple architecture.  The chronology is reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (4th-6th centuries CE), a time known for its remarkable advancements in sculpture. The Gupta sculptural style is characterized by its refined elegance, attention to detail, and emotional expressiveness. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, created by the Pallava dynasty, primarily date to the 7th-9th centuries CE.  Therefore, the Varaha image predates the Mahabalipuram monuments.

Srisailam, another important pilgrimage site housing a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, is situated in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  These pairings correctly link the pilgrimage sites with their respective geographical locations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Pushkar, famous for its Brahma Temple and annual camel fair, is located in the Thar Desert region of Rajasthan and is not associated with the Mahadeo Hills. The statement incorrectly links Pushkar with a geographically inappropriate hill range.  The geographical location of Pushkar is significantly different from the implied location in the statement.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did use the Ibadat Khana for private prayer, its primary function was not solely as a personal mosque. Its significance lies far beyond personal devotion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana, meaning "house of worship," was famously used by Akbar to host discussions and debates with religious scholars from diverse backgrounds, including Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**1. With reference to the arrival of Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's invasion directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology across the Indian subcontinent, revolutionizing warfare.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur did introduce more sophisticated gunpowder weaponry, the technology was already present in India, albeit less developed, before his arrival.  The use of gunpowder in warfare in India predates Babur's reign significantly.  Various kingdoms and empires had already employed rudimentary forms of gunpowder weaponry. Babur's superior artillery and tactics gave him a decisive advantage, but it wasn't a complete introduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Babur's architectural preferences did influence Indian architecture, the widespread use of arches and domes was already well-established in the region prior to his arrival.   The Delhi Sultanate, for instance, had constructed numerous buildings showcasing this architectural style.  Babur's contributions were more about refinement and adaptation of existing techniques within the Timurid tradition, rather than a complete introduction. The statement implies a complete and exclusive establishment, which is inaccurate. The Timurid dynasty's establishment in India is, however, a direct consequence of Babur's successful conquest.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), making it significantly older than the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, which belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE).  This establishes a clear chronological precedence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram are attributed to the Pallava dynasty (7th century CE), while the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, though its exact construction date is debated, is generally considered to have been built during the Kalinga period, spanning several centuries, including periods after the Pallava dynasty.  Therefore, the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram are not necessarily later than the Lingaraja Temple. The timeline isn't straightforward and there's overlap and debate in the exact dating of these structures.

While illustrated manuscripts remained important, there was a growing emphasis on individual portraits, often depicting the emperor himself, his family, and court officials, along with detailed depictions of flora and fauna.  Album art, consisting of collections of individual paintings, also gained prominence during this era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) was not primarily a place of private prayer.  Instead, it served as a venue for theological discussions and debates between scholars of different religious traditions.  Akbar's aim was to foster religious harmony and understanding, and the Ibadat Khana played a crucial role in this policy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key distinction of Mahayana Buddhism is its deification of the Buddha, elevating him to a divine status.  The Bodhisattva path, where individuals delay their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is also central to Mahayana.  This emphasis on compassion and the potential for universal Buddhahood contrasts with Theravada Buddhism's focus on individual arhatship.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism significantly incorporated image worship and ritual practices into its tradition.  The visual representation of the Buddha and other deities became important tools for devotion and spiritual practice.  The development of elaborate rituals and ceremonies further enhanced the devotional aspects of the faith.  While meditation remained important, Mahayana Buddhism did not eschew ritual and image worship.  The visual and ritual elements served to make the path to enlightenment more accessible to a wider population.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the defining characteristics of the Nagara and Dravidian styles of temple architecture.  The Nagara style, common in northern and central India, is known for its curved, beehive-shaped shikharas (towers) which rise gracefully. These structures are often richly ornamented with sculptures and intricate carvings.

The Dravidian style, found predominantly in southern India, displays a distinct architectural character. Its vimana towers are tall, pyramidal structures, built from sturdy granite. The use of granite, with its ability to withstand weathering, contributed to the longevity and imposing presence of Dravidian temples. The overall aesthetic of Dravidian temples is often more imposing and monumental compared to the more elegant Nagara style.


**3. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization lacked monumental structures like palaces or temples, unlike those found in contemporary civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A notable feature of the Harappan Civilization is the absence of large-scale monumental structures such as palaces or temples, unlike the grand pyramids of Egypt or the ziggurats of Mesopotamia. While the Harappans possessed sophisticated urban planning and engineering skills, their architecture seems to have prioritized functionality and community structures over monumental displays of power or religious grandeur. The lack of such structures is a significant differentiating factor when comparing the Harappan Civilization with its contemporaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While evidence suggests the Harappans were familiar with horses, there is limited to no archaeological evidence supporting the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in their warfare or daily life.  The presence of horse remains is sparse, and the technology for large-scale chariot production is not clearly evident in the archaeological record.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While red sandstone was prominently used in early Mughal architecture, particularly during Akbar's reign, later Mughal emperors increasingly favored white marble, as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.  The shift in preferred building materials reflects evolving aesthetic preferences and technological advancements. The use of white marble allowed for more intricate detailing and a different visual impact than the more rustic red sandstone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Taj Mahal's construction was initiated by Shah Jahan, Akbar's grandson, to serve as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.  The project spanned many years and represents the pinnacle of Mughal architectural achievement, showcasing a refined blend of Persian, Indian, and Islamic design elements.

The Bhakti movement's roots lie in South India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, with the Alvars and Nayanmars, and it gradually spread northwards, gaining momentum in the 15th and 16th centuries. The movement's emphasis on devotion and personal relationship with God resonated across various regions and social strata, leading to its widespread influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhakti saints were not monolithic in their views. While some, particularly those associated with the Nirguna school (like Kabir), emphasized formlessness of God and criticized ritualistic practices, others belonging to the Saguna school (like Ramanuja and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu) accepted Vedic scriptures and the importance of image worship in fostering devotion.  The diversity of approaches within the Bhakti movement highlights its adaptability and capacity to incorporate different beliefs and practices.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were significant urban centers, Rakhigarhi in Haryana, India, is now considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization based on current archaeological findings.  The extensive area and the remains of numerous structures at Rakhigarhi have led to this reassessment of the size and scope of the civilization's settlements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Despite considerable effort, the Harappan script remains undeciphered.  The pictographic nature of the script and the limited number of inscribed artifacts pose significant challenges to decipherment.  This lack of understanding of their writing system limits our ability to fully comprehend the social, political, and religious aspects of the Harappan Civilization.  The undeciphered script remains a major mystery in the study of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Konark was inscribed in 1984, while Khajuraho was inscribed in 1986. The difference in inscription years highlights the staggered process by which sites are evaluated and recognized by UNESCO.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ajanta and Ellora Caves are both located in the state of Maharashtra, not Madhya Pradesh.  Both cave complexes are renowned for their intricate rock-cut architecture and murals, reflecting the rich artistic and religious traditions of India.  The geographical proximity of these two significant sites in Maharashtra underscores the region's importance as a center of artistic and cultural activity.

These coins often feature bilingual inscriptions, using both Greek and Sanskrit or Prakrit, demonstrating the cultural exchange between the two civilizations. The use of both languages on the coins indicates the attempt to appeal to both Greek and Indian populations within their territories.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gupta Empire is celebrated for its high-quality gold coinage.  The gold coins, often featuring images of the ruler and other symbolic representations, are considered some of the finest examples of ancient Indian numismatics. The use of gold signified the empire's wealth and power, and the coins themselves were often works of art.  The Gupta coinage provides valuable insights into the artistic and technological capabilities of the period, as well as the political and religious context of the Gupta rule.

Statement 1 is incorrect because *Raghuvamsa* and *Kumarasambhava* are not plays; they are renowned epic poems.  *Raghuvamsa* traces the lineage of the Raghus, a royal dynasty, while *Kumarasambhava* narrates the birth of Lord Kartikeya.  These poems are celebrated for their narrative skill, vivid descriptions, and exploration of complex themes. Statement 2 is correct. *Meghaduta*, a lyrical masterpiece, is a poem in the form of a message carried by a cloud, while *Ritusamhara* is a descriptive poem focusing on the six seasons of India. Both poems display Kalidasa's exceptional command of language, imagery, and emotional depth.  His plays, such as *Abhijnanashakuntalam* (Shakuntala), are his other prominent works, but they are not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects Kalidasa's literary output as described.


**2. With reference to Shashanka's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  He ruled the Gauda kingdom during the 7th century CE, concurrently with Harshavardhana and Bhaskaravarman.
2.  Known for his patronage of Buddhism, he constructed numerous magnificent Buddhist stupas throughout Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Shashanka, the first king of ancient Bengal, ruled the Gauda kingdom from approximately 600 to 625 CE.  This period overlapped with the reigns of Harshavardhana in North India and Bhaskaravarman in Kamarupa (Assam), making statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. Shashanka is known for his strong Hindu leanings and his persecution of Buddhism, not his patronage.  Historical accounts indicate he actively destroyed Buddhist stupas in Bengal, including, according to some accounts, the original Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya.  His actions highlight a significant religious conflict during this period. The contrast between his actions and the statement's assertion about his Buddhist patronage makes statement 2 factually inaccurate.


**3. With reference to Harshavardhana's rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  His vast empire, extending across North India, was characterized by a highly centralized administrative system with strong royal control over all aspects of governance.
2.  While initially a devotee of Shiva and Surya, he later embraced Mahayana Buddhism, significantly influencing the religious landscape of his empire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Harshavardhana's reign (606-647 CE) saw a vast empire in North India. However, statement 1 is incorrect. His administration, while extensive, wasn't entirely centralized.  The feudal system was prevalent, granting land to officials (feudatories) in exchange for taxes, which decentralized some power.  This system, while contributing to the empire's reach, diluted the king's direct control.  Statement 2 is correct. Harshavardhana's religious evolution is well-documented.  Initially worshipping Shiva and Surya, he later converted to Mahayana Buddhism, influencing religious policies and fostering Buddhist institutions within his empire.  His patronage of Buddhism and the two major Buddhist meetings held during his reign are testament to this shift. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to Dharma Pala's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  He is credited with the establishment of Vikramshila University, a renowned center of Buddhist learning, during the 8th century CE.
2.  His reign saw the construction of numerous Hindu temples dedicated to various deities, reflecting the religious diversity of his era.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dharma Pala, the second ruler of the Pala dynasty of Bengal, was a significant patron of Buddhism. Statement 1 is correct. He is widely credited with the founding of Vikramshila University, a prominent center of Buddhist learning that rivaled Nalanda.  His contributions to the university’s development significantly impacted Buddhist scholarship and education in the region.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Dharma Pala's reign was marked by significant construction projects, the focus was primarily on Buddhist institutions like the Somapuri Mahavihara and monasteries at Paharpur and Odantapuri.  There's little historical evidence suggesting a widespread construction of Hindu temples during his rule. His known epigraphs and constructions overwhelmingly point towards Buddhist patronage. Thus, only statement 1 is historically accurate.


**5. With reference to Gorakhnath's legacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  A prominent Nath Yogi associated with Shaivism, his teachings emphasized the pursuit of truth and spiritual self-discovery through rigorous yogic practices.
2.  His followers, the Gorakhnathis, primarily resided in the Deccan plateau and played a significant role in the Bhakti movement of South India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gorakhnath, a significant figure in Nath Yogic tradition, is associated with Shaivism. Statement 1 is correct. His teachings focused on spiritual self-realization ("Samadhi") through yoga, meditation, and ethical living.  His writings, particularly on Laya Yoga, highlight his contributions to yogic philosophy.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The Gorakhnathis, Gorakhnathi, Darshani, or Kanphatas were primarily located in the Indian Himalayan plains and Nepal, not the Deccan plateau.  Their involvement in resisting Islamic and British rule from the 14th century onwards was primarily in the north, and their association with the Bhakti movement in South India is not historically supported.  The geographical distribution and historical context of their activities contradict statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**6. With reference to Amir Khusrau's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A renowned Sufi musician, poet, and scholar, he is credited with significant innovations in Indian classical music, notably introducing Persian and Arabic elements.
2.  His literary works primarily focused on religious themes, reflecting his deep commitment to Sufi ideals and eschewing secular or romantic subjects.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Amir Khusrau (1253-1325) was a multi-talented figure in South Asian history. Statement 1 is correct.  He significantly enriched Indian classical music by blending Persian and Arabic musical elements. He's considered the "father of Qawwali" and is credited with innovations like the sitar and the development of khyal and tarana styles.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While his Sufi beliefs undoubtedly influenced his work, his literary output wasn't solely religious. He wrote on diverse topics, including secular and romantic themes.  His famous adaptations of the *Laila Majnu* and *Ashiqa* stories illustrate his engagement with secular narratives. The breadth of his literary themes and his contributions to secular genres demonstrate that statement 2 is an oversimplification of his literary legacy. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately captures his multifaceted contributions.


**7. With reference to Marco Polo's travels, consider the following statements:**

1.  His detailed accounts of his travels through Asia, including his visit to the Pandyan kingdom in South India, provided valuable insights into the region's political, economic, and social structures.
2.  His descriptions primarily focused on the religious aspects of the Pandyan kingdom, highlighting the prevalence of Buddhism and Jainism in the region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Marco Polo's travels (1254-1324) provided crucial information about various parts of Asia. Statement 1 is correct. His accounts offered detailed descriptions of the Pandyan kingdom, encompassing political systems, economic activities (like horse imports), and social customs (like funerary practices).  His observations provide valuable historical context for understanding the Pandyan kingdom during that period. However, statement 2 is incorrect. Polo's accounts, while rich in detail, didn't primarily focus on the religious landscape of the Pandyan kingdom. While he might have mentioned religious practices, his observations were broader, encompassing economic, political, and social aspects.  His description of the Pandyan king's wealth and power overshadows any detailed religious analysis, making statement 2 an inaccurate representation of his writings.  Thus, only statement 1 is a true reflection of Marco Polo's contribution to our understanding of the Pandyan kingdom.


**8. With reference to Rudrama Devi's rule, consider the following statements:**

1.  As the youngest ruler of the Kakatiya dynasty, she successfully defended her kingdom against external threats, maintaining its territorial integrity.
2.  Her rule was characterized by strict adherence to traditional patriarchal norms, with limited opportunities for women in administrative positions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rudrama Devi, a remarkable female ruler, defied traditional norms. Statement 1 is correct.  She successfully ruled the Kakatiya dynasty from 1263 until her death, overcoming the challenges of being a woman in a patriarchal society and effectively managing the kingdom's defense and administration.  Her ability to maintain the integrity of the empire despite the challenges she faced is a testament to her leadership skills.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  Contrary to traditional patriarchal norms, Rudrama Devi's reign saw her actively recruiting warriors from non-aristocratic backgrounds and granting them land rights in return for their support.  This indicates a departure from rigid patriarchal structures and a willingness to adapt her approach to governance.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects her rule.


**9. With reference to Muhammad bin Tughlaq's policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  His ambitious attempt to shift the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Devagiri) was a resounding success, leading to economic prosperity and administrative efficiency.
2.  The introduction of token currency ("token money") proved to be a disastrous economic experiment, leading to widespread inflation and economic instability.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign (1324-1351) was marked by bold but often disastrous policies. Statement 1 is incorrect. His attempt to move the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad was a major failure. The forced relocation caused immense hardship, economic disruption, and widespread discontent, ultimately undermining his rule.  The project's failure highlights his flawed judgment in implementing such a large-scale policy without adequate consideration of the practical and social consequences.  Statement 2 is correct. The introduction of token currency was a catastrophic economic decision.  The lack of intrinsic value in the bronze coins led to widespread counterfeiting, inflation, and a collapse of the monetary system, severely damaging the economy. This policy exemplifies his poor understanding of economic principles and the disastrous consequences of poorly conceived reforms. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the outcome of his policies.


**10. With reference to Narsinh Mehta's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  A prominent saint-poet of Gujarat, he primarily composed in Sanskrit, contributing significantly to classical Sanskrit literature.
2.  His devotional songs, particularly the bhajan "Vaishnav Jana To" which became Mahatma Gandhi's favorite, are integral to the spiritual heritage of Gujarat.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Narsinh Mehta (1414-1481) was a significant figure in Gujarati literature and Vaishnava devotional poetry. Statement 1 is incorrect.  He primarily composed in Gujarati, not Sanskrit, contributing significantly to the development of Gujarati literature.  His mastery of the Gujarati language and his ability to express profound spiritual ideas in a language accessible to the common people are central to his legacy. Statement 2 is correct. His devotional songs, particularly "Vaishnav Jana To," are highly revered in Gujarat. The bhajan's emphasis on ethical living and devotion to God resonated deeply with Mahatma Gandhi, who adopted it as his favorite. The enduring popularity of his bhajans and their impact on the spiritual landscape of Gujarat make statement 2 a true reflection of his work.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately captures his contributions.


**11. With reference to Mahmud Begada's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  He significantly expanded the territory of the Gujarat Sultanate, leading to its economic prosperity and cultural flourishing during the 15th century.
2.  His rule was characterized by religious tolerance and equal treatment of all religious communities, fostering harmony amongst diverse groups.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mahmud Begada (1458-1511) was a powerful ruler of Gujarat. Statement 1 is correct. He successfully expanded the Gujarat Sultanate, bringing economic prosperity and fostering cultural growth during his long reign. His administrative policies and focus on infrastructure development contributed to Gujarat's flourishing during this period.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While he was known for his administrative abilities and justice, his rule wasn't marked by widespread religious tolerance.  Although he might have shown individual acts of tolerance, his policies and practices did not consistently promote religious harmony.  The absence of evidence supporting religious tolerance across the board makes statement 2 inaccurate. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes his reign.


**12. With reference to Eknath's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A prominent Marathi saint-poet of the Varkari Sampradaya, he integrated elements of Sufism and Vedanta into his devotional poetry.
2.  His major work, *Eknath Bhagavata*, is a commentary on the entire Bhagavata Purana, showcasing his profound understanding of Hindu scriptures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Eknath (1533-1599) was a significant figure in Marathi literature and the Varkari tradition. Statement 1 is correct. He was deeply influenced by Sufism and Vedanta, incorporating their philosophical insights into his devotional poetry (Abhangas and Bharudas). This unique blend of religious traditions is reflected in his work.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  His major work, *Eknath Bhagavata*, is a commentary on the 11th Skanda (book) of the Bhagavata Purana, not the entire text.  While a significant commentary, it doesn't encompass the entire Bhagavata Purana. The specific scope of his commentary makes statement 2 factually incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**13. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  His policy of *Sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) promoted religious tolerance and harmony amongst diverse religious communities within his empire.
2.  He established a new religion, *Din-i Ilahi*, which aimed to synthesize elements of various religions, including Islam, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Akbar's reign (1542-1605) was characterized by a unique approach to religious policy. Statement 1 is correct. His policy of *Sulh-i-kul* emphasized religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence among various religious communities within his vast empire.  He actively fostered an environment of religious harmony, although not necessarily complete equality. Statement 2 is also correct.  He introduced *Din-i Ilahi*, a syncretic religion attempting to combine elements of Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and other faiths.  While it didn't achieve widespread acceptance, it reflects his attempts at religious synthesis and his interest in promoting a unified vision of faith.  Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's complex and influential religious policies.


**14. With reference to Sankardev's teachings, consider the following statements:**

1.  A prominent Saguna saint, he propagated the Vaishnava school of Bhakti yoga, emphasizing devotion to Lord Krishna.
2.  He primarily composed in Sanskrit, leaving behind a rich body of Sanskrit devotional literature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Sankardev (1449-1568) was a significant Vaishnava saint-scholar from Assam. Statement 1 is correct. He was a Saguna saint, meaning he believed in a personal God with form and attributes.  He strongly promoted the Vaishnava tradition, focusing on devotion to Lord Krishna through Kirtans (religious songs).  His teachings have had a lasting influence, inspiring movements like ISKCON. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  He primarily composed in Brajawali (a mixture of Maithili and Assamese), not Sanskrit. His major works, like *Kirtan Ghosa*, are written in Brajawali, reflecting his focus on reaching a wider audience in the local language.  The language of his compositions makes statement 2 factually inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**15. With reference to Madhavdev's contribution, consider the following statements:**

1.  He succeeded Sankardev as the leader of the Ekasarana Dharma movement, further propagating its philosophy and practices.
2.  He authored numerous Sanskrit epics, significantly expanding the body of classical Sanskrit literature.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Madhavdev was a key figure in the continuation of Sankardev's legacy. Statement 1 is correct. He succeeded Sankardev as the leader of the Ekasarana Dharma movement in Assam, continuing to propagate its monotheistic philosophy centered on Lord Krishna.  His role in consolidating and expanding the movement's reach is well-documented. However, statement 2 is incorrect. He did not primarily write Sanskrit epics. While his literary contributions are significant, they were predominantly in Assamese or Brajawali, not Sanskrit.  His focus on regional languages and his efforts to adapt the Ekasarana Dharma to the local context make statement 2 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is true.


**16. With reference to Surdas's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  A blind devotee of Lord Krishna, he belonged to the Nirguna school of thought, emphasizing the formless nature of the divine.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Surdas (1478-1580) was a prominent figure in Krishna Bhakti poetry. Statement 1 is incorrect. He belonged to the Saguna school of thought, emphasizing the divine's form and attributes.  His deep devotion to Lord Krishna and his vivid descriptions of Krishna's life and leelas (divine acts) are central to his poetry. Statement 2 is correct. His *Sursagar* is a celebrated collection of devotional poems dedicated to Lord Krishna, known for its lyrical beauty and profound emotional impact.  The work's significance in Krishna Bhakti literature makes statement 2 accurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**17. With reference to Meerabai's devotional poetry, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Meerabai (1498-1546) is a celebrated figure in the history of Krishna Bhakti. Statement 1 is incorrect. While born into a royal family, she primarily composed her bhajans in Rajasthani, not Sanskrit. Her choice of language made her devotional poetry accessible to a wider audience, emphasizing the importance of regional languages in religious expression. Statement 2 is correct.  Her bhajans, expressing intense love for Lord Krishna, are deeply cherished and continue to be sung and appreciated across various regions of India.  The profound emotional depth and spiritual intensity of her poetry made statement 2 accurately reflect the importance of her contribution. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dadu Dayal (1544-1603) was a reformer who challenged traditional religious practices. Statement 1 is correct. He rejected the authority of the Vedas, the caste system, and the outward forms of worship prevalent in his time, emphasizing instead the importance of japa (repeating the name of God) and direct personal experience of the divine.  His emphasis on inner spiritual transformation makes statement 1 accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect. His followers, the Dadupanthis, did not focus on external rituals or elaborate ceremonies.  They emphasized the importance of inner spiritual practice, emphasizing the direct path to God over external displays of devotion.  The nature of Dadupanthi practices directly contradicts statement 2. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**19. With reference to Dnyaneshwar's literary contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  He authored *Dnyaneshwari*, a Marathi commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, and *Amrutanubhav*, a work of profound spiritual insights.

His devotional poetry in Marathi contributed significantly to the development of Marathi devotional literature, not Sanskrit.  The language of his compositions makes statement 1 inaccurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tukaram (17th century CE) was a prominent Varkari saint known for his social reformist views. Statement 1 is incorrect. He was a strong opponent of the caste system and advocated for social justice and equality.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Samarth Ramdas (1608-1681) was a significant figure in Marathi religious thought. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While a devotee of Lord Rama and Hanuman, he primarily propagated Advaita Vedanta, not Dvaita Vedanta.  His teachings emphasized the oneness of Brahman and Atman, a core tenet of Advaita Vedanta.  The philosophical basis of his teachings makes statement 1 inaccurate. Statement 2 is correct.  His *Dasbodh* is a highly influential treatise on Advaita Vedanta, widely respected for its clarity and depth.  The work's significance in Advaita Vedanta makes statement 2 accurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Guru Ghasidas (1756-1836) was a social reformer who championed equality. Statement 1 is correct. He founded the Satnami community, emphasizing equality and strongly criticizing the caste system.  He advocated for the rejection of idol worship, aligning with the Nirguna school of thought.  His actions and beliefs support statement 1. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  He belonged to the Nirguna school, rejecting idol worship, not promoting it.  His emphasis on the formless nature of God and his opposition to idol worship directly contradict the assertion in statement 2. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**25. With reference to the Sufi movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi orders, or *silsilas*, were strictly hierarchical, with a clear chain of authority from the Pir/Sheikh to the murids (disciples) and Khalifas (successors).
2.  The *Be-shara* Sufis, unlike the *Ba-shara* Sufis, strictly adhered to Sharia law, emphasizing the importance of religious ritual and orthodoxy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sufi movement in India had a complex organizational structure. Statement 1 is correct.  The Sufi orders (*silsilas*) had a hierarchical structure, with a clear line of authority from the Pir/Sheikh (spiritual leader) to the murids (disciples) and Khalifas (successors). This hierarchical system helped maintain the continuity and consistency of Sufi teachings and practices.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The *Be-shara* Sufis *did not* adhere to Sharia law; they were known for their rejection of strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy and their emphasis on personal spiritual experience.  The *Ba-shara* Sufis, on the other hand, followed Sharia law. The contrasting approaches of the two groups make statement 2 factually incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**26. With reference to the different Sufi orders in India, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sufi orders in India had distinct characteristics. Statement 1 is correct. The Chishti order, founded by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, was known for its emphasis on Wahadat-ul-Wujud (unity of being), a concept that resonates with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Hindu thought. This philosophical similarity contributed to the order's influence and acceptance among some segments of the Indian population. Statement 2 is also correct. The Suhrawardi order, introduced by Sheikh Bahauddin Zakariya, differed from the Chishti order in its rejection of the practice of bowing before initiation into the order.  This difference in ritual practice highlights the diversity of beliefs and practices within the Sufi movement.  Both statements accurately reflect the distinctions between these two significant Sufi orders.


**27. Consider the following statements about the three stages in the history of Sufism:**

1. The first stage, also known as the age of Golden Mysticism, saw the rise of the Khanqah as a central institution for Sufi practices.
2.  The third stage witnessed the decline of Sufism as a popular movement due to the rise of orthodox interpretations of Islam.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sufi movement evolved through distinct stages. Statement 1 is correct. The first stage, often referred to as the age of Golden Mysticism, saw the development of the Khanqah (Sufi monastery) as a vital center for Sufi practices, teachings, and community life.  The Khanqah played a crucial role in shaping the Sufi movement's institutional structure and its social impact. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The third stage, while seeing shifts in Sufi practices, did not mark a decline in the movement's popularity.  Sufism continued to exert significant influence, adapting to changing social and political contexts.  The assertion of a decline in popularity is not supported by historical evidence.  The continued presence and influence of Sufi orders throughout history makes statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.



**1. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine being worthy of worship.
2.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is central to Mahayana Buddhism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana Buddhism, a major branch of Buddhism, significantly diverges from Theravada Buddhism in its theological and philosophical perspectives.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a key tenet of Mahayana Buddhism: the deification of the Buddha.  Unlike Theravada, which focuses on the Buddha as a historical figure and a model for achieving enlightenment through personal effort, Mahayana elevates the Buddha to a divine status, making him an object of worship and veneration. This is evident in the elaborate rituals, iconography, and devotional practices associated with Mahayana. Statement 2 is equally valid. The Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana. Bodhisattvas are considered highly evolved beings who have attained enlightenment but choose to remain in the cycle of samsara to guide and assist others on their path to Buddhahood. This selfless act of compassion and dedication underscores the Mahayana emphasis on universal salvation and the interconnectedness of all beings.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately represent core aspects of Mahayana Buddhism. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually correct reflections of Mahayana Buddhist doctrine.

1.  The Vijayanagara kings were known for their construction of large-scale irrigation works, including tanks and canals, to support agriculture.
2.  The Vijayanagara style of temple architecture is characterized by the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) as a prominent feature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646 CE) left a significant mark on South Indian history, particularly in its architectural and engineering achievements. Statement 1 is correct because the empire's rulers understood the importance of agriculture for economic prosperity and political stability.  They invested heavily in developing sophisticated irrigation systems, constructing numerous tanks (reservoirs) and canals to ensure reliable water supply for cultivation even during periods of drought. These systems were crucial for supporting the empire's vast agricultural base and its substantial population. Statement 2 is also correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style, a distinctive blend of indigenous South Indian traditions and influences from other cultures, is characterized by several unique features. One such feature is the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas within temple complexes. These structures served as wedding pavilions, highlighting the importance of marriage and social rituals within the religious context. The Kalyana Mandapas are often ornately decorated and represent a significant aspect of Vijayanagara temple design. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are accurate representations of the Vijayanagara Empire's characteristics. Option (d) is also incorrect as both aspects are historically verified.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Emperors and their patronage of art, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar's reign saw a significant shift from illustrated manuscripts to album and individual portrait painting.
2.  Emperor Jahangir was a keen painter himself and his reign is associated with a greater emphasis on individual portraiture, often incorporating elements of flora and fauna.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mughal Empire's patronage of art and culture profoundly impacted the development of various art forms in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's reign witnessed a flourishing of art, particularly in illustrated manuscripts, it is inaccurate to say there was a major shift *away* from them towards individual portraits at that time.  Akbar's court was renowned for its patronage of illustrated manuscripts, such as the Akbarnama, which combined artistic skill with historical narrative. Although portraiture existed, it wasn't the dominant form. Statement 2 is correct. Emperor Jahangir, known for his personal interest in painting and his own artistic abilities, significantly shifted the focus of Mughal art. His reign saw a rise in the popularity of individual portraits, often characterized by a high degree of realism and detail.  These portraits frequently incorporated elements of natural history, depicting flora, fauna, and even specific details of the subject's attire and surroundings, reflecting Jahangir's personal fascination with the natural world. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is inaccurate. Option (d) is also incorrect because statement 2 accurately describes a significant development in Mughal art during Jahangir's reign.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, remains a subject of ongoing archaeological research and interpretation. Statement 1 is correct.  While the exact size and population of IVC sites are still debated due to ongoing excavations and varying methodologies, current evidence strongly suggests Rakhigarhi in Haryana as the largest known site.  This is based on the extensive area covered by the excavated remains, indicating a significant urban settlement. Statement 2 is also correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Sindh, Pakistan, is unique among the major IVC sites for its lack of a citadel.  Citadals, elevated fortified areas within IVC cities, are a common feature, often interpreted as administrative or religious centers. The absence of a citadel at Chanhudaro suggests a different urban organization or a possible specialized function compared to other IVC cities. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect since both statements are supported by current archaeological findings. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of the IVC.


**5. Consider the following statements about ancient Indian ports:**

1.  Lothal, situated near present-day Ahmedabad, Gujarat, was a significant port city known for its well-developed dockyard.
2.  Muziris, located on the Malabar Coast (present-day Kerala), was a prominent port mentioned in ancient Sangam literature and played a crucial role in trade with the Roman Empire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ancient India's maritime trade was extensive, connecting it with various regions across the Indian Ocean. Statement 1 is correct. Lothal, situated in the Gujarat region, was a key port city of the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeological evidence reveals the presence of a sophisticated dockyard, highlighting the advanced maritime technology and trade activities of the IVC. The dockyard's construction and design demonstrate a high level of engineering skill and planning for efficient handling of ships and goods. Statement 2 is also correct. Muziris, located on the Kerala coast, was a major port of ancient South India, playing a vital role in trade with the Roman Empire and other regions.  Its prominence is well-documented in the Sangam literature, a collection of ancient Tamil poems and prose, which provide valuable insights into the social, economic, and political aspects of ancient South India, including its maritime trade. The port's strategic location facilitated the exchange of goods like spices, textiles, and precious stones between India and the Roman world.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are historically accurate. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements accurately reflect the importance of these ports in ancient Indian maritime trade.


**6. With reference to the spread of Indian religions abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia was primarily facilitated by Indian missionaries who established Theravada Buddhism in the region.
2.  The introduction of Hinduism to Southeast Asia occurred significantly later than the spread of Buddhism, primarily through trade and cultural exchange.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The spread of Indian religions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism, had a profound impact on the cultures and societies of Southeast Asia. Statement 1 is largely correct. While trade played a role, the active missionary efforts of Indian monks and scholars were crucial in establishing Theravada Buddhism in several Southeast Asian countries.  These missionaries not only introduced Buddhist teachings but also helped establish monastic institutions, translate scriptures into local languages, and adapt Buddhist practices to the local contexts.  This active propagation distinguishes the spread of Buddhism from the more gradual dissemination of Hinduism. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While trade and cultural exchange certainly contributed to the spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia, it's inaccurate to say it happened significantly *later* than Buddhism.  Evidence suggests that the influence of Hinduism in the region began relatively early, alongside or even concurrently with the spread of Buddhism, albeit through different mechanisms. The establishment of Hindu kingdoms and the adoption of Hindu religious and cultural practices in some Southeast Asian regions occurred alongside the Buddhist presence.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 accurately reflects the primary mechanism for the spread of Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia.  Statement 2 is only partially correct, and thus (c) and (d) are inappropriate.


**7. With reference to the Gupta period in Indian history, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gupta Empire's coinage featured the peacock as a recurring symbol, reflecting the importance of this bird in ancient Indian iconography and culture.
2.  The Western Chalukya dynasty, which emerged after the decline of the Guptas, prominently used the image of the boar in their coinage.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE) is considered a golden age in Indian history, marked by significant advancements in various fields.  Statement 1 is correct.  Gupta coinage is renowned for its artistic merit and the use of various symbols, with the peacock being a frequently recurring motif.  The peacock's inclusion on Gupta coins likely reflects its symbolic significance in ancient Indian culture, representing beauty, royalty, and prosperity.  The detailed depiction of the peacock on these coins also reflects the high level of artistic skill during the Gupta period.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Western Chalukya dynasty, a prominent power in South India after the Gupta Empire, used the boar (varaha) as a significant symbol in their coinage and iconography.  The boar is associated with the Hindu deity Vishnu, particularly in his Varaha avatar (boar incarnation), which is depicted rescuing the earth goddess from the cosmic ocean. The use of the boar on Western Chalukya coins indicates their religious beliefs and their connection to the broader Hindu tradition. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect, as both statements accurately reflect the use of animal symbols in the coinage of the respective dynasties. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect established historical facts.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India boasts a rich heritage of rock-cut architecture, reflecting diverse religious and cultural influences. Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves, located near Gaya in Bihar, are among the earliest examples of rock-cut architecture in India.  Dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), these caves were initially constructed for the Ajivikas, a heterodox religious sect that emphasized asceticism and denial of the soul's existence.  The caves' construction demonstrates the advanced rock-cutting techniques of the Mauryan era. Statement 2 is also correct. The Ajanta caves, situated in Maharashtra, are a remarkable complex of rock-cut caves.  These caves are famous for their exquisitely preserved Buddhist mural paintings, which date back to various periods. Many of these paintings depict scenes from the Jataka tales, stories about the previous lives of the Buddha.  The Ajanta paintings are highly valued for their artistic sophistication, vibrant colors, and insights into the religious and cultural life of ancient India. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect characteristics of these important rock-cut sites.

2.  The Ilahi faith gained widespread popularity among the general population during Akbar's reign, becoming a dominant religious force in the Mughal Empire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Akbar's reign (1556-1605 CE) was a period of significant religious and social experimentation within the Mughal Empire. Statement 1 is correct. Akbar, known for his religious tolerance and intellectual curiosity, promoted a syncretic religious movement known as the Ilahi faith. This movement attempted to synthesize elements from various religious traditions, including Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.  Akbar's aim was to create a unifying religious system that transcended sectarian divisions and fostered harmony among his diverse subjects.  The Ilahi faith incorporated elements of divine unity, ethical principles, and ritual practices from different faiths. Statement 2 is incorrect. Despite Akbar's patronage, the Ilahi faith never achieved widespread popularity among the general population.  It remained largely confined to a small circle of Akbar's close associates and courtiers who were drawn to the emperor's vision of religious synthesis.  The majority of the Mughal Empire's population continued to adhere to their established religious beliefs and practices. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 accurately reflects the nature and goals of the Ilahi faith. Statement 2 is inaccurate because the Ilahi faith failed to become a mainstream religion during Akbar's reign.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Excavations at Rakhigarhi have revealed it to be one of the largest, if not the largest, settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization. Its size and the extent of its remains suggest a significant urban center within the Harappan network.  The discovery of multiple granaries, residential areas, and a complex drainage system further supports its importance as a major city of the civilization.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Unlike many other Harappan cities which featured a raised citadel, Chanhudaro lacks this characteristic feature. This unique aspect distinguishes it from other major urban centers and has led to considerable scholarly debate regarding its social and political organization within the Harappan context. The absence of a citadel may indicate a different form of urban planning or social structure compared to other sites.  The presence of specialized workshops, particularly for bead-making, suggests a focus on craft production.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are factually accurate. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Harappan Civilization.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving Buddhahood, choose to remain in the world to guide and assist others on the path to enlightenment. This selfless act of compassion and dedication to the welfare of all beings is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism.  The concept of accumulating merit through acts of compassion to assist others in achieving enlightenment is a key element of Mahayana practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The deification of the Buddha is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism, not Hinayana (Theravada).  Hinayana Buddhism focuses on individual enlightenment through personal practice and adherence to the Buddha's teachings, without the emphasis on the deification of the Buddha as a divine figure. Mahayana Buddhism sees the Buddha as a transcendent figure worthy of worship and veneration, with various forms and manifestations representing different aspects of Buddhahood.  The concept of a single, historical Buddha is less emphasized in Mahayana compared to Theravada.

Option (b) is incorrect because statement 1 is accurate. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is correct.

These pavilions often displayed intricate carvings, reflecting the empire's artistic sophistication and grandeur.  Their inclusion within temple complexes underscores the importance of ritual and social life within the religious context of the Vijayanagara period.  The architectural style of Kalyana mandapas, with their distinctive features and decorative elements, provides valuable insights into the artistic and cultural preferences of the Vijayanagara rulers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Vijayanagara Empire was primarily characterized by its patronage of Hindu religious architecture and sculpture.  While there might have been some tolerance for other faiths, the vast majority of surviving architectural structures and artistic works from the period are associated with Hinduism.  The construction of numerous temples, with their complex designs and elaborate ornamentation, testifies to the strong Hindu religious identity of the Vijayanagara rulers.  The empire's artistic output, including sculpture, painting, and architecture, largely reflects Hindu religious themes and iconography.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of Vijayanagara architecture, while statement 2 misrepresents the empire's religious patronage.

His compositions often incorporated themes and narratives from Hindu mythology and religious traditions, reflecting the religious syncretism prevalent during Akbar's reign. His musical legacy continues to be influential in Hindustani classical music. The dhrupads composed by Tansen showcase his deep understanding of both musical theory and religious narratives.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Jahangir's reign saw a significant shift in Mughal artistic patronage. While illustrated manuscripts remained important, Jahangir's personal interest in painting led to a greater emphasis on individual portraits, often characterized by meticulous detail and psychological insight.  The creation of albums, collecting diverse works of art, further reflects this shift towards a more diverse and personal approach to artistic expression.  Jahangir's patronage encouraged the development of a distinct style of portraiture, influencing subsequent Mughal artistic trends.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of Mughal art and culture during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE) is widely recognized as a golden age in Indian history, marked by significant advancements in various fields, including art, architecture, and literature.  Temple architecture flourished during this era, with numerous temples being built across the empire.  These temples often incorporated elements of earlier architectural styles while showcasing the Gupta period's distinctive artistic sensibilities. The construction of temples during the Gupta period reflects the strong religious beliefs and the flourishing of Hinduism during the era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta caves are indeed renowned for their exquisite murals, the majority of the cave construction and painting predates the Gupta period.  Although some additions and renovations might have occurred during the Gupta era, the caves' main development took place earlier, during the Satavahana and Vakataka periods.  The Ajanta murals represent a blend of artistic styles and influences from different periods, reflecting the evolution of Indian art over several centuries.


Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 accurately reflects the architectural achievements of the Gupta period, while statement 2 misrepresents the chronology of the Ajanta caves.


**8. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur is a prime example of Chola architecture, known for its massive vimana (tower) and intricate sculptures.
2.  Chola architecture primarily followed the Nagara style of temple construction.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, built during the reign of Rajaraja I, stands as a magnificent testament to Chola architectural prowess.

1. The use of arches and domes became a prominent feature in Indo-Islamic architecture, replacing the earlier trabeate style.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture extensively incorporated human and animal figures in its sculptures and carvings, similar to earlier Hindu temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Indo-Islamic architecture, resulting from a fusion of Indian and Islamic architectural traditions, is characterized by the prominent use of arches and domes.  These elements, absent or less emphasized in earlier trabeate styles, became defining features of mosques, tombs, and other structures built during this period.  The introduction of arches and domes significantly altered the aesthetic and structural aspects of Indian architecture. The shift from a primarily trabeate style to one dominated by arcuate elements reflects the influence of Islamic architectural traditions on Indian building practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Unlike earlier Hindu temple architecture, which often featured elaborate sculptures of deities, animals, and humans, Indo-Islamic architecture generally avoided the depiction of living beings.

**1. With reference to the architectural features introduced to India by Babur, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival marked the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology in India's military affairs.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the prominent use of arches and domes, was significantly influenced by  Persian and Central Asian traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While gunpowder was present in India before Babur's arrival, his invasion significantly introduced and popularized more advanced gunpowder weaponry and military tactics from Central Asia, profoundly impacting warfare in the subcontinent.  This led to a shift in military strategies and power dynamics.

Statement 2 is also correct. Babur's Timurid architectural style, a blend of Persian and Central Asian influences, is characterized by the use of arches and domes. This style contrasted with pre-existing Indian architectural traditions and became a significant element shaping subsequent Mughal architecture.  The introduction of these architectural elements significantly altered the landscape of Indian architecture, influencing the design of mosques, tombs, and palaces for centuries.  The assertion that this style was *significantly* influenced by Persian and Central Asian traditions is factually accurate, reflecting the historical and cultural context of the Timurid empire.


**2. With reference to the chronology of significant works of Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli predates the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, dates back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), while the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh, belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE).  Therefore, the Dhauli Elephant is considerably older. This chronological difference reflects the evolution of Indian art and its stylistic changes across different historical periods.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar certainly used the Ibadat Khana for personal prayer, its primary function was not solely for private devotion. Its significance lies more in its role as a space for interfaith dialogue.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ibadat Khana was a crucial center for Akbar's religious debates and discussions with scholars representing various faiths, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.  This reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in diverse theological perspectives.  The Ibadat Khana's role in fostering these discussions is a key aspect of understanding Akbar's reign and its impact on religious dynamics in India.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization was highly developed urban civilization, there is no conclusive evidence of grand palaces or temples on the scale of later civilizations.

The absence of large-scale monumental structures is a key characteristic of the Indus Valley Civilization, distinguishing it from later periods.

Statement 2 is correct. Evidence from archaeological finds, including seals and figurines, suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities, indicating a complex religious system. The duality in the deities worshipped is a significant characteristic of their religious practices.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.

The distinction between these two types of structures is fundamental to understanding Buddhist monastic life and religious practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the primary functional difference is crucial, there are also architectural distinctions between Chaityas and Viharas.  Chaityas often have a characteristic apsidal shape and are designed for congregational worship, while Viharas typically comprise multiple cells or rooms for individual monks.  These architectural differences, though subtle sometimes, reflect the different purposes of these structures.

**38. With reference to the Sunyata doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suny

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, including a grid-like road network and advanced drainage systems.
2.  Evidence suggests the Harappans primarily worshipped a single, male deity, neglecting female deities in their religious practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological excavations at major Harappan sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkably well-planned urban layout.  The cities featured grid patterns of streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, indicating advanced engineering and urban planning skills far ahead of their time.  This advanced urban planning is a hallmark of the Indus Valley Civilization and a key area of study for understanding its societal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the interpretation of Harappan religious practices is still debated, evidence points to the worship of both male and female deities.  The discovery of numerous figurines, seals, and other artifacts depicting both male and female figures suggests a complex religious system that wasn't solely focused on a single male deity.  The "Pashupati Seal," for instance, depicts a figure that has been interpreted as a proto-Shiva, yet the presence of other figures and symbols indicates a broader pantheon.  The assertion of a singular male deity is an oversimplification of the current understanding.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  Image worship and elaborate rituals were entirely absent in Mahayana Buddhism, contrasting sharply with Theravada traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of the Bodhisattva.  Unlike the Arhat ideal in Theravada Buddhism, where the focus is on individual enlightenment, Bodhisattvas actively strive to help all beings attain Nirvana, delaying their own final liberation. This compassionate ideal is central to Mahayana's emphasis on universal salvation and active engagement with the world.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverges from Theravada in its embrace of image worship and elaborate rituals.  The development of iconic representations of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, coupled with increasingly complex ritual practices, became prominent features of Mahayana Buddhist traditions.  These practices are not mere deviations but integral aspects of its devotional and spiritual approach. The statement incorrectly presents a stark contrast where a nuanced understanding is needed.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive architectural feature of Vijayanagara temples, reflecting the empire's cultural and social norms.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's economy was solely reliant on agriculture, with little involvement in trade or commerce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kalyana Mandapas are indeed a notable architectural feature found in many Vijayanagara temples.  These structures, dedicated to marriage ceremonies, represent the empire's strong emphasis on social rituals and its artistic achievements in architecture.  The intricate carvings and overall design of these mandapas showcase the sophistication of Vijayanagara art and its integration into religious structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Vijayanagara Empire's economy was far more diverse than simply agriculture.  While agriculture was undoubtedly significant, the empire actively engaged in extensive trade networks, both within India and internationally.  Its strategic location facilitated access to important trade routes, leading to the flourishing of commercial activities and the accumulation of significant wealth.  To describe its economy as solely agricultural is a significant oversimplification.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album paintings, reflecting his personal interest in art.
2.  Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in Akbar's court, is credited with inventing numerous new ragas and composing dhrupads solely on Hindu deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jahangir's reign marked a significant shift in Mughal artistic patronage. While Akbar's court had produced magnificent illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's personal passion for art led to a greater emphasis on individual portraits, often featuring meticulous detail and a focus on realism. The creation of albums containing a collection of paintings also became more prominent during his reign.  This shift reflects a broader change in aesthetic preferences and artistic styles.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Mian Tansen was indeed a highly influential musician in Akbar's court and is known for composing dhrupads, it's inaccurate to say he *solely* composed on Hindu deities. His compositions encompassed a wider range of themes, reflecting the diverse cultural context of the Mughal court.  The claim of solely focusing on Hindu deities is an overstatement.


**5. With reference to Indian religious movements, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbarkacharya was a contemporary of Akbar, contributing to the religious synthesis during Akbar's reign.
2. Saint Kabir was significantly influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent Sufi scholar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nimbarkacharya's life predates Akbar's reign by several centuries.  While Akbar's reign did witness a period of religious synthesis, Nimbarkacharya's contributions to Vaishnavism occurred much earlier.  The statement incorrectly links these two figures chronologically.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kabir's teachings predate Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's by several decades.  Kabir's philosophy, known for its syncretic nature, drew inspiration from both Hinduism and Islam, but his major influences predate Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's lifetime. The statement creates a false connection between two distinct religious figures of different periods.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The largest known Indus Valley Civilization site is Rakhigarhi, located in present-day Haryana.
2.  The Indus script has been fully deciphered, revealing detailed information about the civilization's social and political structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Current archaeological evidence suggests that Rakhigarhi is the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization. Its extensive remains, including residential areas, granaries, and cemeteries, provide valuable insights into the urban planning and daily life of the civilization. The scale of Rakhigarhi surpasses that of previously known major sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered. Despite extensive research, scholars have not yet succeeded in interpreting its meaning. This lack of decipherment limits our understanding of the civilization's writing system, religious beliefs, and social organization.  The claim of full decipherment is completely false.


**7. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves, known for their Asokan-era rock-cut chambers, were originally constructed for Ajivika ascetics.
2. The Ajanta caves are primarily known for their Buddhist mural paintings, while the Ellora caves showcase a blend of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period, were indeed constructed for Ajivika ascetics.  These caves, remarkable for their polished rock-cut chambers, represent a significant achievement in ancient Indian rock-cut architecture and provide evidence of the patronage extended to different religious sects during the Mauryan Empire.

Statement 2 is correct. Ajanta caves are renowned for their exquisite Buddhist mural paintings, while Ellora caves uniquely feature cave temples representing Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain faiths, reflecting the religious tolerance and artistic diversity of the region.  The statement accurately distinguishes the key features of these two important sites.


**8.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional styles of Indian temple architecture.
2.  The Allahabad Pillar inscription is primarily associated with the reign of Emperor Ashoka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are indeed the three major architectural styles that evolved in different parts of India. These styles are distinguished by their distinct structural features, decorative elements, and regional variations in their design.  Understanding these styles is crucial for analyzing the development of temple architecture across India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Allahabad Pillar inscription is associated with Samudragupta of the Gupta Empire, not Ashoka.  The inscription, composed by Harisena, provides valuable information about Samudragupta's reign and military achievements. Attributing it to Ashoka is a major historical error.


**9. With reference to the history of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati school of sculpture, known for its narrative reliefs, flourished under the patronage of the Satavahana dynasty.
2. The Gandhara school of art, heavily influenced by Greco-Roman styles, predominantly depicted Buddhist themes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amaravati school, located in Andhra Pradesh, was indeed a significant center of sculptural activity during the Satavahana period. Its characteristic style emphasized narrative reliefs, depicting scenes from the Buddha's life and Jataka tales. The sculptures were usually made of white marble.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gandhara school, located in the northwest region of the Indian subcontinent, was heavily influenced by Greco-Roman artistic traditions.  The sculptures of this school predominantly featured Buddhist themes, particularly representations of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, often incorporating stylistic elements from Greek and Roman art. The fusion of Indian and foreign artistic styles is a key feature of the Gandhara school.


**10. With reference to UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Konark and the Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya were both declared as World Heritage Sites in the same year.
2.  The Group of Monuments at Hampi includes significant examples of Vijayanagara architecture, such as the Virupaksha Temple and the Vittala Temple complex.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both Konark and Bodh Gaya are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, they were declared in different years.  Konark was inscribed in 1984, while Bodh Gaya was inscribed later in 2002.  The statement incorrectly implies simultaneous inscription.

Statement 2 is correct. The Group of Monuments at Hampi is indeed a UNESCO World Heritage Site and includes a significant collection of Vijayanagara-era structures, including the Virupaksha Temple, the Vittala Temple complex, and many other architectural wonders.  The statement accurately reflects the site's content and significance.


**11.  With reference to Indian painting traditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school of painting is primarily associated with the patronage of the Maratha rulers and is known for its use of gold leaf in its paintings.
2.  The Rajput school of painting is characterized by its uniformity in style across all the different regional schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Thanjavur school of painting did indeed receive significant patronage from Maratha rulers, and its paintings are characterized by the extensive use of gold leaf, creating a rich and opulent visual effect.  This characteristic is a key element of the Thanjavur style and helps distinguish it from other schools of painting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajput school of painting, while sharing some common themes and stylistic features, actually encompasses several distinct regional schools, each with its own unique characteristics.  These regional variations, such as the Mewar, Bundi, or Kangra styles, reflect the diverse artistic traditions and patronage systems within the Rajput kingdoms. The statement presents a false sense of homogeneity.


**12. With reference to the accounts of foreign travelers to India, consider the following statements:**

1. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, described India in his work, "Indica," which has survived completely in its original form.
2. Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler, provided detailed accounts of his travels in India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Megasthenes's "Indica" is a significant source of information about ancient India, the original text has not survived completely.  Only fragments and excerpts have been preserved through the writings of later authors who quoted from it.  The statement incorrectly implies the complete survival of the original text.

Statement 2 is correct. Ibn Battuta's "Rihla" does indeed provide a rich and detailed account of his travels and observations in India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. His descriptions of the social, cultural, and political life of 14th-century India are invaluable for historical research.  The statement accurately reflects the contribution of Ibn Battuta's work.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Al-Biruni, a scholar from Khwarazm, wrote "Kitab-ul-Hind," a comprehensive study of Indian society, culture, and science.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Al-Biruni's "Kitab-ul-Hind" is a monumental work offering a detailed and insightful perspective on various aspects of Indian life, including religion, social customs, science, and mathematics. His work demonstrates his rigorous scholarship and keen observation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Fa-Hien did travel to India during the Gupta period, his famous travelogue is titled "Record of the Buddhist Kingdoms," not "Record of the Western Regions." That title belongs to Xuanzang's account.  The statement incorrectly attributes the wrong title to Fa-Hien's work.


**14. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq founded the city of Tughlaqabad, known for its imposing fort.
2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's ambitious project to shift the capital to Daulatabad was a resounding success, leading to economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq did indeed establish Tughlaqabad and construct its impressive fort.  The fort's design and construction reflect the architectural styles of the Tughlaq period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's attempt to shift the capital to Daulatabad (Devagiri) was a significant failure, causing widespread disruption and hardship.  The project is considered a major misjudgment in his reign, highlighting his sometimes erratic decision-making.  The statement presents a completely inaccurate assessment of the outcome of this major policy.


**15. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest surviving examples of rock-cut caves in India are located at Badami.
2.  The concept of untouchability is clearly articulated for the first time in the Rigvedic texts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Badami caves are significant examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not the earliest surviving examples in India. The Barabar caves, dating back to the Mauryan period, are considered older.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of untouchability, as it developed later in Indian society, is not clearly articulated in the Rigveda.  While social hierarchies existed, the concept of untouchability as a rigid and discriminatory system evolved much later.  The statement misrepresents the social dynamics of the Rigvedic period.



**1. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style of temple architecture is predominantly found in South India, characterized by its towering shikharas and intricate carvings.
2. The Dravida style, prevalent in North India, features a pyramidal structure with multiple tiers and a relatively simpler design compared to the Nagara style.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The Nagara style of temple architecture is primarily associated with North and Central India, not South India.  Its defining characteristic is the curvilinear shikhara (tower) which rises gracefully from the sanctum.  The Dravida style, conversely, is predominantly found in South India and is distinguished by its pyramidal vimana (tower) composed of multiple receding tiers. The description in statement 2 reverses the geographical distribution and stylistic features of the two architectural styles. Therefore, neither statement is accurate.  A thorough understanding of Indian architectural history is crucial to avoid such common misconceptions.


**2. With reference to the early phases of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest surviving examples of rock-cut architecture in India are the caves at Badami, showcasing intricate sculptures and paintings.
2. The Barabar caves, known for their polished rock-cut chambers, were initially built for Ajivikas during the Mauryan Empire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant examples of early rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest surviving ones. The Barabar caves, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), predate the Badami caves. Statement 2 is correct. The Barabar caves, located in Bihar, were indeed originally constructed for the Ajivika sect during the reign of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. These caves are remarkable for their unique construction techniques and the use of highly polished stone.  The question tests knowledge of the chronology and attribution of significant early Indian rock-cut structures.


**3. With reference to the religious and cultural landscape of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Panchayatan" refers to a specific sect within Hinduism focused on the worship of five deities.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  "Panchayatan" does not refer to a religious sect.  Instead, it is an architectural term. Statement 2 is correct.  The Panchayatan style is a significant feature of North Indian temple architecture, where a central shrine (representing the main deity) is surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, often dedicated to associated deities or representing directional elements. This arrangement reflects a specific cosmological and symbolic representation. The correct answer demands a clear understanding of the difference between religious sects and architectural styles in ancient India.


**4. With reference to the development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school of art, flourishing during the Kushana period, primarily depicted Buddhist themes and incorporated Greco-Roman artistic influences.
2. The Mathura school, contemporary to the Gandhara school, focused primarily on Hindu iconography and utilized a distinctly Indian style.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Gandhara school, which thrived in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent during the Kushana period (1st-3rd centuries CE), is renowned for its Buddhist sculptures that blend Indian artistic traditions with Greco-Roman styles.  The Mathura school, also active during the same period but centered in the region around Mathura, developed a distinctly Indian style of art, primarily focused on depicting Hindu deities and narratives.  The question assesses the student's knowledge of the regional variations and stylistic features of ancient Indian art.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire's artistic patronage, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Akbar’s reign witnessed a shift from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album art, reflecting a change in artistic preferences.
2. Emperor Jahangir, known for his keen interest in painting, is credited with the development of the miniature painting style that uniquely characterized Mughal art.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Akbar significantly patronized art and commissioned many illustrated manuscripts, the shift toward individual portraits and album art was more pronounced during the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir's personal interest in painting, coupled with the talents of artists in his court, led to the refinement and distinctive character of Mughal miniature painting, characterized by its realism, detail, and vibrant colors.  The question tests the understanding of the evolution of Mughal artistic styles under different emperors.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly a secular civilization with limited evidence of religious practices or iconography.
2.  Cotton cultivation and textile production were significant aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization's economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the religious beliefs of the Indus Valley Civilization are not fully understood due to limited deciphered textual evidence, archaeological findings like the Pashupati seal and various figurines suggest the presence of religious or spiritual practices and iconography. Statement 2 is correct. Evidence from various Indus Valley sites indicates that cotton cultivation and textile production were important economic activities. The remains of cotton plants and tools associated with textile production have been discovered. The question tests the nuanced understanding of the Indus Valley Civilization, challenging simplistic interpretations of its social and economic structures.


**7. With reference to the development of Indian painting, consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school of painting, primarily patronized by the Vijayanagara rulers, is characterized by its use of vibrant colors and intricate details.
2. The Kangra school, known for its delicate brushwork and romantic themes, flourished during the Mughal period.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Thanjavur school of painting, though also patronized by Maratha rulers, did significantly develop under the patronage of the Vijayanagara empire. It is known for its rich use of gold and vibrant colors. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kangra school, a prominent Pahari school of painting, flourished primarily during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, after the decline of the Mughal Empire. It is renowned for its subtle colors and romantic themes, often depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and literature.  The question assesses the understanding of the chronological development and stylistic features of different schools of Indian painting.

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Indo-Greek rulers, who ruled parts of India from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE, issued coins that often featured both Greek and Sanskrit legends, reflecting the cultural synthesis of their rule.  The Gupta dynasty (4th-6th centuries CE) is known for its high-quality coinage, characterized by standardized weight, consistent designs, and the representation of various Hindu deities and symbols.  The question tests the knowledge of the historical context and stylistic features of ancient Indian coinage.

Both statements are correct. Samkhya is a prominent dualistic school of Indian philosophy that posits the existence of two fundamental realities: purusha (the conscious self) and prakriti (unconscious nature).  The Charvaka school, also known as Lokayata, is a materialistic philosophy that rejects the concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and the authority of the Vedas, emphasizing sensory experience as the primary source of knowledge. The question tests the knowledge of the core tenets of different philosophical schools of ancient India.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system characterized by a grid pattern of roads intersecting at right angles, dividing the city into a citadel and a lower town.
2.  The Harappan script, primarily found on seals, has been fully deciphered, revealing detailed information about their societal structure, religious beliefs, and economic activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological excavations at sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkably advanced urban planning system for its time. The grid-like street layout, sophisticated drainage systems, and the clear division of the city into a citadel (likely for administrative and elite residences) and a lower town demonstrate a high level of urban planning and engineering skills. This is a key characteristic of the Harappan civilization, differentiating it from contemporary civilizations in other parts of the world.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Harappan script, a pictographic script, remains undeciphered.  While numerous seals bearing the script have been discovered, their meaning remains a mystery to scholars.  The lack of a Rosetta Stone-type parallel text has hindered decipherment efforts.  Therefore, we cannot definitively ascertain information about their societal structure, religious beliefs, or economic activities from the script itself.  Ongoing research continues to explore potential decipherment methods, but a complete understanding of the script is still elusive.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to assist others in achieving enlightenment.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism strictly adheres to the original teachings of the Buddha as found in the Pali Canon, rejecting later developments and interpretations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of Bodhisattvas. These are enlightened beings who, despite achieving Buddhahood, choose to delay their own Nirvana to help others attain enlightenment. This emphasis on compassion and selfless service is a distinguishing feature of Mahayana Buddhism.  The Bodhisattva ideal is central to Mahayana scriptures and practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mahayana Buddhism diverges significantly from the Theravada tradition, which largely adheres to the Pali Canon. Mahayana Buddhism incorporates new scriptures, expanded doctrines, and different practices. It developed later than Theravada Buddhism and incorporates new beliefs and practices, such as the concept of Bodhisattvas and the emphasis on devotional practices and image worship.  It's characterized by a more expansive and inclusive approach to Buddhist teachings.


**3. With reference to Vijayanagara architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's temple architecture is characterized by the prominent use of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) within temple complexes.
2. Vijayanagara architecture primarily followed the Nagara style of temple architecture, showcasing its distinct features and characteristics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Vijayanagara temple architecture is renowned for its inclusion of elaborate Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions, within larger temple complexes. These structures served as important spaces for ceremonies and celebrations.  Their presence is a distinguishing feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, reflecting the importance placed on royal patronage and public life within religious contexts.  Examples can be found in numerous temple complexes across the former Vijayanagara kingdom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vijayanagara architecture drew inspiration from various styles, it didn't primarily adhere to the Nagara style.  Vijayanagara architecture developed a unique style that blended elements from various traditions, including Dravidian and other regional styles. The resulting architectural style is distinct and characterized by its own features, rather than a strict adherence to any single existing style like Nagara.  It's characterized by grandeur, extensive use of stone, and intricate detailing.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbarkacharya was a contemporary of Akbar, actively participating in the religious debates and discussions at Akbar's court.
2. Saint Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Naqshbandi Sufi order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nimbarkacharya's lifespan predates Akbar's reign by several centuries.  He is considered to have lived sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries, while Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605.  Therefore, they could not have been contemporaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kabir's teachings were influenced by a synthesis of Hindu and Sufi traditions, but not directly by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi was a prominent figure in the Naqshbandi Sufi order, known for his emphasis on orthodox Islam.  Kabir, on the other hand, rejected rigid religious orthodoxy and preached a message of universal love and tolerance, drawing on both Hindu and Sufi mystical traditions.  The time difference between Kabir and Sirhindi also makes direct influence highly improbable.


**5. With reference to the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album paintings.
2.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is constructed primarily from marble, showcasing the Mughal preference for this material in grand architectural projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's patronage shifted the focus towards individual portraits and album paintings. Jahangir himself was a keen observer of nature and a patron of artistic talent.  His reign saw a rise in the popularity of realistic portraiture, capturing not just human likeness but also the details of clothing, jewelry, and even the expressions of the subjects.  This shift reflects a change in artistic preferences and royal patronage within the Mughal court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Buland Darwaza is primarily constructed from red sandstone, not marble.  While marble was used extensively in Mughal architecture, particularly during Shah Jahan's reign, the Buland Darwaza, built by Akbar, demonstrates a preference for red sandstone in its construction. The use of red sandstone reflects both the availability of materials and the architectural style prevalent during Akbar's time.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization is Rakhigarhi, located in present-day Haryana, exceeding Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in size.
2.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed a well-developed system of writing, with the script fully deciphered, providing insights into their societal organization and religious beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Recent archaeological findings suggest that Rakhigarhi in Haryana is the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization.  While Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were previously considered the largest, excavations at Rakhigarhi have revealed a significantly larger settlement area, indicating a more extensive urban center than previously understood.  This challenges earlier assumptions about the size and distribution of urban settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The script of the Indus Valley Civilization remains undeciphered.  Although thousands of inscriptions have been found on seals, pottery, and other artifacts, their meaning remains unknown.  The absence of a parallel text with a known language has hampered decipherment efforts.  Therefore, we currently lack direct textual evidence about their societal organization and religious beliefs.


**7. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional styles of temple architecture in India, each with its unique characteristics.
2.  The Khajuraho temples are primarily examples of the Dravida style, showcasing its distinctive features like towering gopurams and intricate carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are three major architectural styles found in India. The Nagara style is prevalent in North India, the Dravida style in South India, and the Vesara style in the Deccan region. Each style has unique characteristics in terms of its shikhara (tower), vimana (sanctum), and other architectural elements.  These styles reflect regional variations in building techniques, materials, and cultural influences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Khajuraho temples are primarily examples of the Nagara style, not the Dravida style. While they exhibit some regional variations, their overall architectural features, such as the shikharas (towers) and the general layout, align more closely with the Nagara style.  The Dravida style is characterized by its towering gopurams (gateway towers) and pyramidal vimana (sanctum), which are not the dominant features of Khajuraho temples.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school of painting is primarily associated with the patronage of the Maratha rulers, who significantly influenced its development and style.
2.  The Thanjavur school of painting has been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) status for its distinctive use of gold coating in the paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Thanjavur school of painting flourished under the patronage of the Maratha rulers.  Their influence is evident in the style, themes, and the overall development of the school. The Maratha patronage provided the necessary resources and support for the artists, leading to the creation of numerous masterpieces.  The style is characterized by its vibrant colours and detailed depictions of religious and mythological scenes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Thanjavur school of painting has indeed been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) status. This recognition protects the unique characteristics of the school, including its distinctive use of gold leaf and other elements. The GI tag ensures that only authentic Thanjavur paintings, adhering to specific criteria, can be marketed under that name, preventing imitation and protecting the heritage of the art form.


**9. With reference to the Bengal School of Art, consider the following statements:**

1. Abanindranath Tagore was a leading figure in the Bengal School, advocating for a revival of Indian artistic traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abanindranath Tagore was a pivotal figure in the Bengal School of Art. He championed a revival of Indian artistic traditions, drawing inspiration from Mughal and Rajput styles, and rejecting the influence of Western art. His works emphasized spiritual themes and a distinctly Indian aesthetic.  He is considered the founder of the school and trained many significant artists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rabindranath Tagore, the famous poet and Nobel laureate, was associated with the Bengal School (through his family connection and general influence on cultural revival), Satyendranath Tagore's role in the Bengal School was not significant.  Satyendranath Tagore was a distinguished civil servant but he didn’t have any direct involvement in the art movement.


**10. With reference to regional Indian painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1. Pattachitra is a traditional scroll painting style primarily associated with Odisha, known for its vibrant colours and narrative scenes.
2.  Phad paintings, characterized by their large size and depiction of folk tales and religious narratives, are primarily associated with Karnataka.

Statement 1 is correct. Pattachitra is a traditional style of scroll painting from Odisha.  It is known for its intricate details, vibrant colours, and the depiction of religious and mythological stories.  The paintings are usually done on cloth and are often used in religious ceremonies and rituals.  The style is characterized by its flat perspective and use of natural pigments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Phad paintings are primarily associated with Rajasthan, not Karnataka.  These large-scale paintings depict folk tales, religious stories, and the lives of saints.  They are often used in religious processions and are an important part of the cultural heritage of Rajasthan.  The style is characterized by its bold lines, flat perspective, and use of bright colours.



**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, evident in the grid-like layout of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Evidence suggests the extensive use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during the Harappan period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Harappan civilization is renowned for its advanced urban planning, showcased by the grid pattern of streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes found in major cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. This demonstrates a high level of engineering and societal organization.  This urban planning is a key characteristic distinguishing the Harappan civilization from its predecessors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization possessed advanced technologies, there's currently no conclusive archaeological evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during that period.  While horse remains have been found in some later Harappan sites, their role in warfare remains debated among archaeologists.  The absence of clear depictions or artifacts related to chariots in the primary Harappan sites suggests a limited or non-existent role in their military strategies.  The assertion of widespread use in warfare is therefore unsubstantiated.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  The concept of the Triratna (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) is central to Mahayana Buddhism, forming the foundation of its religious practice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide sentient beings towards enlightenment. This emphasizes compassion and selfless service as pathways to spiritual liberation, a significant departure from the Theravada emphasis on individual enlightenment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Triratna (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) is fundamental to Buddhism as a whole, it's not uniquely emphasized or differently interpreted within Mahayana Buddhism in comparison to Theravada. Both schools fundamentally share the same core concepts within the Triratna, although their interpretations and practices may differ. The Triratna’s importance is a shared foundational element across various Buddhist schools.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara rulers were known for their patronage of temple architecture, as evidenced by the construction of the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi.
2.  The Kalyana Mandapa, a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, was primarily used for royal audiences and administrative functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire is celebrated for its magnificent temple architecture, a testament to its rulers' patronage of religious and artistic endeavors. The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi stands as a prime example, showcasing the empire's architectural prowess and artistic sophistication.  Many other temples at Hampi and elsewhere demonstrate the scale and quality of this patronage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) were indeed a prominent feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, their primary function was for marriage ceremonies and related celebrations, not royal audiences or administrative gatherings.  While such events *might* have taken place there occasionally, the primary designated purpose was explicitly for weddings and related rituals within the temple complex.  The statement misrepresents the intended use of these structures.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar initiated the Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic religious movement aimed at fostering religious harmony within his empire.
2.  Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in Akbar's court, is credited with inventing several new Ragas in Indian classical music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar, known for his religious tolerance, introduced Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic faith attempting to blend elements from various religions prevalent in his empire.  While it didn't achieve widespread adoption, it reflects his policy of religious pluralism and his efforts to create a unifying religious ideology. The attempt itself is historically significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mian Tansen was a highly accomplished musician in Akbar's court, and significantly contributed to the development of Indian classical music through his compositions and performances, he is not historically credited with *inventing* new Ragas.  The evolution of ragas was a gradual process spanning centuries, with contributions from many musicians and composers. Attributing the invention of entirely new Ragas solely to Tansen is an oversimplification of a complex historical development.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Saint Nimbark, a prominent figure of the Bhakti Movement, was a contemporary of Mughal emperor Akbar.
2.  Saint Kabir's teachings drew inspiration from both Hindu and Sufi traditions, reflecting the syncretic nature of the Bhakti Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbark's life predates Akbar's reign by several centuries.  The timeframe of Nimbark's activity places him firmly within an earlier period of the Bhakti Movement, long before the Mughal era.  Confusing the timelines of different Bhakti figures is a common error.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir's philosophy is a prime example of the syncretic nature of the Bhakti Movement, seamlessly blending elements from both Hindu and Sufi traditions.  His poetry and teachings reflect this synthesis, transcending sectarian boundaries and advocating for religious harmony and unity.  This intermingling of ideas is a defining characteristic of the Bhakti Movement's broader impact.


**6. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

The Ajanta Caves are world-famous for their remarkable murals, which narrate stories from the Jataka tales, showcasing a high level of artistic skill and providing valuable insights into Buddhist art and culture.  The preservation of these paintings is a testament to their enduring significance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Barabar caves, dating back to the Mauryan era, were constructed specifically to serve as shelters for Ajivika ascetics.  This demonstrates the Mauryan emperors' tolerance towards different religious sects and their support for various religious practices. The caves' unique architectural features reflect the specific needs and preferences of the Ajivika community.


**7. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization had a well-developed system of weights and measures, indicating a high degree of standardization and trade.
2.  Evidence from Indus sites points to the existence of a centralized, powerful state controlling all aspects of life within the civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indus Valley Civilization possessed a remarkably standardized system of weights and measures, evidenced by the uniformity of bricks and other artifacts found at various sites. This suggests a sophisticated understanding of measurement and a developed system of trade and commerce across the vast geographical expanse of the civilization.  This standardization is a significant indicator of advanced societal organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization showed signs of centralized planning (urban design), there is no definitive evidence supporting the existence of a highly centralized, powerful state dictating all aspects of life.  The degree of central control remains a subject of ongoing debate among archaeologists. The lack of monumental structures like palaces or temples, and the relatively equal size of dwellings, suggests a less hierarchical society than some other ancient civilizations.  The statement overstates the level of centralized power.


**8. With reference to Ashokan inscriptions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Maski inscription is notable for being the first Ashokan inscription to explicitly mention the name "Ashoka."
2.  The Kalinga edicts, found in Odisha, primarily focus on Ashoka's military campaigns and conquests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Maski inscription holds historical significance as it is the first Ashokan inscription to use the name "Ashoka," rather than the earlier titles "Devanampriya" or "Priyadarsi." This provides crucial evidence for identifying the inscriptions' author definitively.  The use of the personal name is a landmark in understanding the evolution of Ashokan inscriptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kalinga edicts, while referencing the Kalinga War, primarily focus on Ashoka's subsequent conversion to Buddhism and his renunciation of violence.  They emphasize his remorse for the war's brutality and his adoption of a policy of non-violence and dhamma.  The edicts highlight his moral transformation and the shift in his governance philosophy, rather than glorifying military achievements.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the architectural contributions of the Timurid dynasty in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Timurid rulers significantly popularized the use of the 'charbagh' style of garden design, characterized by a square plot divided into four equal parts by canals.
2.  The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture is primarily attributed to the Timurid period, marking a distinct shift from earlier architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The charbagh garden style, featuring a symmetrical layout with water channels, became a prominent feature of Timurid and later Mughal architecture. This style, reflecting Persian influence, was adopted and refined in India, becoming a hallmark of Mughal gardens.  Examples like the gardens of the Taj Mahal showcase this style's widespread adoption.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Timurids did contribute to the development of arch and dome usage in Indian architecture, it's inaccurate to solely credit them with the introduction.  The arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture, notably in pre-Islamic structures and during the Delhi Sultanate period. The Timurids, however, did refine and expand upon these existing techniques, blending them with Persian styles to create a unique Indo-Islamic architectural vocabulary.  Attributing the introduction solely to the Timurids overlooks the earlier evolution of these architectural elements in the Indian subcontinent.


**2. With reference to the earliest examples of Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli predates the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar and the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves.
2. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram represent a later phase of rock-cut architecture compared to the Dhauli Elephant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to remain in the cycle of rebirth to assist others in achieving enlightenment, a concept absent in the earlier Hinayana schools. This selfless dedication and compassionate action are fundamental tenets of Mahayana philosophy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the teachings of the Buddha and individual enlightenment,  the deification of the Buddha and the practice of image worship are prominent features of Mahayana Buddhism.  Mahayana Buddhism developed a rich iconography and ritualistic practices centered around the veneration of Buddha images and Bodhisattvas.

These structures were integral to the social and religious life of the empire, reflecting the grandeur and sophistication of Vijayanagara art and architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara style drew inspiration from earlier architectural traditions, it developed its own unique characteristics. It did not primarily follow the Chalukya style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka's life predates Akbar's reign by several centuries. He is associated with the Dvaita Vedanta school of thought and lived much earlier than the Mughal emperor. His philosophical contributions significantly predate the Mughal era and are independent of Akbar's religious policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Saint Kabir's teachings were rooted in a syncretic blend of Hindu and Sufi traditions. He lived and propagated his philosophy before Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's birth. While Kabir's message of religious harmony resonated across faiths, his philosophy is not directly linked to Sirhindi, who was a prominent figure in the Naqshbandi Sufi order and known for his conservative views opposed to Akbar's religious syncretism.  The chronological gap between Kabir and Sirhindi makes direct influence highly improbable.


**5. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Akbar's reign was a significant period for the development of Mughal painting, the shift towards album and individual portrait painting became more pronounced under his successors, particularly Jahangir. Akbar's patronage focused heavily on illustrated manuscripts, although his reign laid the groundwork for the later stylistic changes.

Statement 2 is correct.  Jahangir, a connoisseur of art and himself a skilled painter, greatly patronized Mughal painting. His reign is particularly noted for the increased emphasis on individual portraiture, often featuring detailed depictions of flora, fauna, and even the emperor himself interacting with nature.  This focus on naturalistic representation and individual portraits marked a stylistic evolution from the earlier emphasis on illustrated manuscripts.

The Barabar caves, located in Bihar, predate the Badami caves and represent some of the earliest surviving examples of rock-cut architecture in the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 2 is correct. The Barabar caves, known for their unique architectural features and polished interior surfaces, were indeed commissioned by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya for the Ajivika sect.  The caves' construction during the Mauryan period provides valuable insights into the religious patronage and architectural capabilities of the era.  The inscriptional evidence and architectural style confirm their association with the Ajivikas and the Mauryan dynasty.


**7. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed grand palaces and temples comparable in scale to those of later civilizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed remarkable urban planning and engineering skills, evident in its well-planned cities, there is limited evidence of large-scale palaces or temples comparable to those of later periods.  The structures excavated so far suggest a different architectural approach, possibly reflecting a different social and religious organization.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings, including sculptures and seals, indicate the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The presence of figurines representing mother goddesses and other deities suggests a complex religious system with a range of divinities. The interpretation of some symbols remains debated, but the evidence clearly supports the worship of multiple deities, including both male and female.


**8. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three main racial groups of the Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are architectural styles of Hindu temples, not racial groups.  These styles are distinguished by their distinct features, such as the shape of the shikhara (tower), the plan of the temple, and the decorative motifs.  They represent regional variations in temple design rather than any correlation with racial classifications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is a prime example of the Nagara style of temple architecture, not the Dravida style.  The Nagara style is characterized by its curvilinear shikhara, whereas the Dravida style features a pyramidal or stepped shikhara. The architectural features of the Lingaraja Temple clearly align with the Nagara style prevalent in eastern and northern India.

Statement 1 is correct. The Sthanakvasi sect is a prominent sub-sect within Jainism, distinguished by its specific practices and interpretations of Jain teachings.  It represents one of the various branches within the broader Jain tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sautrantika and Sammitiya were indeed Buddhist schools of thought, not Jain sects.  These schools belonged to the larger spectrum of Buddhist philosophy and developed their own distinct interpretations of Buddhist doctrines. The Jain philosophical tradition developed its own distinct schools and concepts, separate from those of Buddhism.


**10. With reference to Buddhist literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Milinda Panha is a text containing dialogues between King Milinda and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.
2.  The Mahavamsa is a text written in Sanskrit and chronicles the history of Buddhism in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Milinda Panha, also known as the Questions of King Milinda, is a well-known text featuring a philosophical debate between King Menander (Milinda) and the Buddhist monk Nagasena. This dialogue offers valuable insights into Buddhist philosophy and its engagement with contemporary intellectual traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mahavamsa is a significant historical text chronicling the history of Sri Lanka, not solely the history of Buddhism in India.  It is written in Pali, not Sanskrit, and details the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and its subsequent development on the island.  While it references Indian Buddhist history, its primary focus is on the Sri Lankan context.


**11. With reference to the  concepts of Buddhism and Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Buddhism and Jainism reject the authority of the Vedas.
2.  Both Buddhism and Jainism advocate for the concept of an eternal soul (Atman).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both Buddhism and Jainism, while originating in the Indian context, challenged the authority of the Vedas as the sole source of religious and philosophical truth. They developed their own distinct sets of scriptures and doctrines, independent from the Vedic tradition.  This rejection of Vedic authority is a key aspect of both religious traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Jainism accepts the concept of a soul (Jiva), Buddhism rejects the notion of a permanent, unchanging self (Atman).  This fundamental difference in their understanding of the nature of self is a crucial distinction between the two philosophies.  Buddhism emphasizes impermanence (Anicca) and the absence of a fixed, enduring self.


**12.  With reference to  ancient Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rigveda is the oldest of the four Vedas and primarily focuses on themes of worldly prosperity and natural beauty.
2.  The Atharvaveda is primarily concerned with rituals and sacrifices, similar to the Yajurveda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rigveda is generally considered the oldest of the four Vedas and contains hymns dedicated to various deities, reflecting a focus on the natural world, societal prosperity, and the relationship between humans and the divine.  It showcases the early Vedic worldview and the development of Sanskrit poetry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Atharvaveda does contain some ritualistic elements, it is significantly different from the Yajurveda. The Atharvaveda is more focused on spells, charms, and practical applications of knowledge related to healing, agriculture, and everyday life, including elements of magic and incantations. The Yajurveda, in contrast, is primarily a liturgical text focusing on the procedures and mantras for sacrificial rites.


**13. With reference to Indian classical dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is characterized by its emphasis on both Tandava and Lasya aspects, with a prominent use of mudras.
2.  Kuchipudi, primarily from Andhra Pradesh, is a predominantly male-performed dance form with minimal use of props and elaborate facial makeup.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is indeed known for its balanced emphasis on both Tandava (masculine, energetic) and Lasya (feminine, graceful) elements.  The intricate use of mudras (hand gestures) is a fundamental aspect of Bharatanatyam, conveying emotions and narratives through precise movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kuchipudi originates in Andhra Pradesh, it is not exclusively a male-performed dance form. Although historically performed by male Brahmin priests, Kuchipudi is now performed by both men and women.  While elaborate costumes are used, the elaborate facial makeup characteristic of Kathakali is not a feature of Kuchipudi.  Kuchipudi also utilizes various props and stage settings depending on the narrative presented.


**14. With reference to ancient Indian coins, consider the following statements:**

1.  The coins of the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore featured images of Narasimha, Shiva, and Parvati.
2.  Tipu Sultan's coins used only one era for dating.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The coinage of the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore did indeed feature various religious iconography.  The coins of King Kanthiraya Narasa included the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, while Haidar Ali continued using the imagery of Shiva and Parvati.  This reflects the religious beliefs and patronage of the rulers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tipu Sultan's coinage is notable for the use of *two* eras—the Hijri and the Saka—for dating purposes. This reflects the interaction of different cultural and temporal systems within his kingdom.  The dual era system on Tipu Sultan's coins is a distinct feature of his numismatic legacy.


**15. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism to Sri Lanka is primarily attributed to the efforts of Ashoka's missionaries.
2.  The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea provides detailed information about the ports of ancient India and the maritime trade routes that facilitated the spread of Indian culture.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect historical facts.  The Kanganahalli site in Karnataka is renowned for its stone sculpture depicting Ashoka, uniquely identified by the Brahmi inscription "Ranyo Ashoka."  This inscription confirms the depiction's subject and provides valuable chronological context.  Separately, the Shahbazgarhi site in Pakistan holds significant importance due to its Ashokan rock edicts inscribed in Kharosthi script, dating back to the 3rd century BC.  These edicts are crucial for understanding Ashoka's reign and the dissemination of his edicts across diverse regions. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude one of the accurate statements. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are historically verified.

1. The Kalyana Mandapa (wedding pavilion) is a distinctive architectural feature primarily associated with temples of the Vijayanagara kingdom.
2. The "Arjuna's Penance" relief sculpture is a prominent feature of the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, showcasing the Pallava dynasty's artistic prowess.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Kalyana Mandapa, a significant architectural element in Vijayanagara temples, exemplifies the kingdom's artistic and architectural achievements.  Its presence in temple complexes like the Vittala Temple at Hampi is well-documented.  Similarly, "Arjuna's Penance," a monumental relief carving at Mahabalipuram, is a hallmark of Pallava art. This intricate depiction, along with other rock-cut monuments at the site, demonstrates the Pallava dynasty's mastery of stone carving and its importance in Indian art history.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the historical accuracy of both statements.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are factually accurate. Archaeological evidence firmly establishes Chanhudaro and Kot Diji as significant sites of the Harappan Civilization, showcasing its urban development and material culture.  Conversely, Sohgaura's archaeological findings are associated with the Mauryan period, not the Harappan Civilization.  The second statement correctly highlights the standardized bricks as a hallmark of Harappan urban planning, reflecting their advanced technological capabilities in construction and urban design.  The uniform dimensions of these bricks demonstrate a level of precision and organization not commonly found in earlier civilizations.

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to assist others in achieving enlightenment.
2. The deification of the Buddha and the practice of image worship are central tenets of Mahayana Buddhism, marking a departure from earlier Buddhist traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key characteristics of Mahayana Buddhism.  The Bodhisattva ideal, central to Mahayana, represents a profound shift in Buddhist thought.  Bodhisattvas, having attained enlightenment, choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide others toward liberation. This selfless act of compassion is a defining feature of Mahayana.  Furthermore, the deification of the Buddha and the incorporation of image worship are significant departures from earlier, Theravada Buddhist practices.  These developments contributed to the widespread popularity and syncretic nature of Mahayana Buddhism. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the importance of both Bodhisattva ideal and the deification of the Buddha within Mahayana Buddhism.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Jahangir, known for his patronage of art, shifted the emphasis from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album paintings.
2. Emperor Akbar's reign witnessed the construction of the Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri, primarily using red and buff sandstone.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Mughal Empire's artistic and architectural history.  Jahangir's personal interest in painting led to a significant shift in Mughal artistic production, favoring individual portraits and album formats over large-scale illustrated manuscripts. This change reflects a move towards a more personal and intimate style of artistic expression.  The Buland Darwaza, a magnificent gateway at Fatehpur Sikri, is a prime example of Akbar's architectural patronage.  Its construction using red and buff sandstone is well-documented, showcasing the architectural style prevalent during that era. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the historical facts related to both Jahangir's artistic preferences and the construction of the Buland Darwaza.


**6. With reference to the religious history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure of the Naqshbandi Sufi order.
2. Saint Nimbarka, a prominent figure in the history of Vaishnavism, was a contemporary of Emperor Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are historically inaccurate.  Kabir's teachings, while demonstrating syncretic influences from both Hinduism and Islam,  were not significantly shaped by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Their lifespans and the temporal distance between their activities suggest limited direct interaction or influence.  Similarly, the historical consensus places Nimbarka's life several centuries *before* Akbar's reign, making their contemporaneity highly unlikely.  Precise dating of Nimbarka's life remains a subject of scholarly debate, but existing evidence firmly places him in a much earlier period. Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect because they wrongly attribute influence or contemporaneity that is not supported by historical evidence.


**7. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization is Rakhigarhi, located in Haryana, and it has yielded evidence of granaries, cemeteries, and sophisticated drainage systems.
2.  Mohenjo-daro, situated on the Indus River, is famous for its "Great Bath," a large, carefully constructed structure of uncertain purpose, and the "Priest-King" statue, a significant bronze sculpture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Rakhigarhi's extensive excavations have revealed it to be the largest known Indus Valley Civilization site, surpassing even Mohenjo-daro in size.  The discovery of granaries, cemeteries, and well-planned drainage systems provides insights into the civilization's social organization, burial practices, and advanced urban planning.  Mohenjo-daro, another significant site, is famous for the "Great Bath," a large, meticulously constructed structure whose exact purpose remains a topic of discussion, and the "Priest-King" statue, a notable bronze artifact that showcases the high level of artistic skill during that period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the significance of both Rakhigarhi and Mohenjo-daro in the context of the Indus Valley Civilization.


**8. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara style, prevalent in northern India, features curvilinear shikharas (towers), while the Dravida style, common in southern India, is characterized by pyramidal vimana (towers).
2.  The Vesara style, a hybrid of Nagara and Dravida, is found in the temple architecture of Karnataka and displays a blend of both styles' characteristics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify key features of Indian temple architectural styles. The Nagara style, dominant in northern India, is readily recognized by its curvilinear shikharas, which rise gracefully to a point. In contrast, the Dravida style, prevalent in the south, is distinguished by its pyramidal vimana, creating a distinct visual profile.  The Vesara style, an interesting synthesis of Nagara and Dravida elements, is a testament to the dynamic interplay of architectural traditions across different regions of India, particularly visible in the temples of Karnataka.  The Vesara style showcases a skillful combination of both curvilinear and pyramidal forms, reflecting the architectural innovation and cultural exchange that occurred in this region.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of Indian temple architecture.


**9. With reference to the Allahabad Pillar Inscription, consider the following statements:**

1. The inscription, primarily in Sanskrit, is associated with Samudragupta, a prominent ruler of the Gupta Empire, and provides valuable information about his reign and conquests.
2.  The inscription is located on a monolithic pillar at Allahabad (Prayagraj) and is considered a significant historical source for understanding the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Allahabad Pillar Inscription. The inscription, largely in Sanskrit, is prominently linked to Samudragupta, offering crucial insights into his military campaigns, administrative policies, and cultural patronage.  The detailed description of his conquests and the extent of his empire make it an essential source for studying the Gupta period. The inscription's location on a monolithic pillar at Allahabad further reinforces its historical significance. The inscription's inscription on a single pillar of stone adds to its importance as a lasting monument and historical record. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to appreciate the dual significance of the inscription – its association with Samudragupta and its physical location.


**10. With reference to the evolution of Indian painting, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta cave paintings, dating back to the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE, represent a significant early stage in the development of Indian painting, showcasing both Buddhist themes and sophisticated artistic techniques.
2.  The Mughal school of painting, flourishing under the patronage of Mughal emperors, blended Persian and Indian artistic traditions, resulting in a distinct and highly refined style characterized by realistic depictions and detailed miniature works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Ajanta cave paintings are widely recognized as a landmark achievement in early Indian art.  The paintings, spanning several centuries, beautifully illustrate Buddhist narratives, demonstrate mastery of fresco techniques, and reflect the artistic sensibilities of the time. The Mughal school of painting, which flourished under the Mughal emperors, represents a significant phase in Indian art history.  It successfully integrated Persian and Indian artistic traditions to create a unique style characterized by meticulous detail, vibrant colors, and realistic depictions.  The fusion of artistic influences resulted in a distinct and highly refined style that profoundly influenced subsequent Indian painting traditions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not recognize the significant contributions of both Ajanta cave paintings and the Mughal school of painting to the overall development of Indian art.


**1. With reference to the Timurid dynasty and its impact on India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival in India marked the definitive introduction of gunpowder warfare tactics to the subcontinent.
2. The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the arch and dome, significantly influenced subsequent Indian architecture.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's use of gunpowder weaponry was impactful, gunpowder technology and its application in warfare had already existed in India before his arrival, albeit perhaps not as sophisticated or widespread.  The Delhi Sultanate, for example, had employed gunpowder in battles. Babur's military innovations were significant, emphasizing the use of artillery and cavalry, but they didn't represent a complete introduction to the subcontinent.

Statement 2 is correct. Babur, a Timurid prince, brought with him architectural styles prevalent in Central Asia, which were significantly influenced by Persian and other Central Asian traditions. The characteristic use of arches and domes in Timurid architecture became a defining feature of Mughal architecture and subsequently spread its influence across India, impacting mosque, tomb, and palace design.  This architectural style contrasted significantly with the prevailing pre-Mughal styles.  The integration of these elements represents a notable shift in Indian architectural aesthetics and technique.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli predates the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar.
2. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves is contemporaneous with the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, a Mauryan-era artifact dating back to the 3rd century BCE, significantly predates the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later, primarily during the 11th century CE. This chronological difference highlights the evolution of Indian art and architectural styles over a considerable period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th century CE. While both belong to the classical period of Indian art, they are not contemporaneous; there's a significant time gap between their creation. The difference reflects the stylistic developments and patronage shifts within Indian art history.


**3. With reference to pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Srisailam is located in the Nallamala Hills, while Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills.
2. Pushkar is located in the Mahadeo Hills.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Srisailam, a significant pilgrimage site, is indeed located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  Omkareshwar, another important pilgrimage destination, is situated on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, but is associated with the Satmala range. The geographical location of these sites reflects the distribution of religious centers across India's diverse landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Pushkar, famous for its Brahma temple, is located in the state of Rajasthan, but not in the Mahadeo Hills.  The temple's location on the plains of Rajasthan, near Ajmer, differs from the mountainous regions where many other pilgrimage sites are found. This distinction highlights the varied geographical contexts in which religious sites developed in India.


**4. With reference to Buddhist sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in Ladakh.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, not in the Zanskar Valley of Ladakh.  The geographical distinction reflects the spread of Buddhism across the Himalayan region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alchi Temple Complex is indeed located in Ladakh, a region known for its unique blend of Tibetan Buddhist art and architecture.  Its location in Ladakh highlights the influence of Tibetan Buddhism in this part of India.


**5. With reference to the term "Panchayatan" in Indian cultural history, consider the following statements:**

1. Panchayatan refers to a style of temple construction characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines.
2. Panchayatan is primarily associated with the administrative structure of ancient Indian villages.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Panchayatan is a well-established term in the context of Indian temple architecture, specifically referring to a style where a central shrine is flanked by four subsidiary shrines, often representing different deities.  This arrangement has symbolic and aesthetic significance in temple design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While "panchayat" refers to village councils in India, "Panchayatan" is not related to the administrative organization of villages.  The term is purely architectural in its usage and meaning. The confusion might arise from the similar-sounding words, but their meanings are distinct.


**6. With reference to Indian sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana with celestial musicians and sorrowful followers is found in the Ellora Caves.
2. Arjuna's Penance is a prominent rock-cut sculpture at Mamallapuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana with celestial musicians and sorrowful followers is found in the Ajanta Caves, not Ellora.  The difference highlights the distinct artistic styles and thematic focus of these two major cave complexes.

Statement 2 is correct. Arjuna's Penance is a renowned rock-cut relief sculpture at Mamallapuram, showcasing the Pallava dynasty's artistic achievements.  Its location and style are well-documented.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as a private prayer chamber for Akbar.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar certainly used the Ibadat Khana for personal reflection and prayer, its primary function was not as a private chamber. Its significance lies in its role as a space for open religious dialogue.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ibadat Khana was instrumental in Akbar's efforts to foster religious harmony and understanding. He held regular discussions with scholars from diverse religious backgrounds, including Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity, in an attempt to synthesize different religious beliefs.  This reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in exploring various spiritual traditions.


**8. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indus Valley Civilization demonstrated remarkable urban planning and engineering skills, there is no conclusive archaeological evidence of large-scale palaces or temples in the same way as found in later civilizations.  The understanding of their societal structure is still evolving based on ongoing research.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings suggest the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The discovery of various figurines and seals depicting both masculine and feminine figures supports this conclusion.  The religious beliefs of the civilization are still a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.


**11. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut caves, consider the following statements:**

1. Chaityas were primarily places of worship, while Viharas served as dwelling places for monks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Satavahana dynasty, ruling from 232 BC to 227 AD, primarily utilized lead for their coinage, making silver a less frequent material.  They also employed potin, a silver-copper alloy, as a coinage material. This aligns perfectly with statement 1.  Statement 2 is also accurate, as the reverse of many Satavahana coins featured the Ujjain symbol—a cross with four terminal circles—and frequently included depictions of animals like elephants, horses, or lions. The combination of the Ujjain symbol and animal imagery was a distinctive characteristic of their coinage.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a key feature of Western Satraps coinage: the use of Saka era dating (beginning 78 AD) and the frequent depiction of the ruling king's portrait on one side of the coin. This was a common practice. However, statement 2 is partially incorrect. While some Western Satraps coins did show Buddhist chaityas or stupas, this was not a *consistent* feature across all their coinage. The connection to Satavahana iconography is true, but the exclusive use of Prakrit is an oversimplification; various scripts were employed.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to Gupta-era coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gupta coinage primarily consisted of gold coins, with silver and copper coins issued only after Chandragupta II's victory over the Western Satraps.
2.  The reverse side of Gupta gold coins invariably displayed the image of Goddess Lakshmi, reflecting the strong Hindu revival during the Gupta period, and the inscriptions were exclusively in Sanskrit using the Brahmi script.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Gupta coinage system. While gold was the dominant metal, silver and copper coins became more prevalent after Chandragupta II's conquests.  Statement 2, however, is inaccurate.  While Goddess Lakshmi was a frequent motif on the reverse of Gupta coins, it wasn't *invariably* present. Other deities and symbols also appeared. Furthermore, while Sanskrit was indeed used, the assertion that the Brahmi script was *exclusively* used is incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**4. With reference to the coins of the Vardhana dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vardhana dynasty's silver coins featured the king's head on one side and a peacock on the other, and the dates on Harshavardhana's coins are calculated based on an era that is believed to have begun in 606 AD.
2.  Harshavardhana's coins were solely made of silver, reflecting the dynasty's economic policy, and their inscriptions exclusively used Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct in describing the typical design of Vardhana silver coins (king's head/peacock) and the dating system used by Harshavardhana (likely starting 606 AD). Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. First, while silver was prominent, it's not accurate to say Harshavardhana's coins were *exclusively* silver. Other metals were likely used. Second, the claim that inscriptions were exclusively in Sanskrit is an overstatement.  While Sanskrit was common, other languages or scripts might have been used in some instances. Thus, only statement 1 holds completely true.


**5. With reference to the coinage of the Chalukyan dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1. The early Chalukyan coins (6th century AD) often depicted a temple or a lion on one side, leaving the other side blank, while the Eastern Chalukyan coins (7th-12th centuries AD) prominently featured a boar image at the center.
2.  All Chalukyan coins used only Sanskrit inscriptions, and the blank side of the coins reflected a deliberate stylistic choice rather than any lack of minting technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the common iconography on Chalukyan coins. The early Chalukyas often used temple or lion imagery, leaving the reverse blank, whereas the Eastern Chalukyas frequently employed the boar.  Statement 2 is inaccurate.  While Sanskrit was common, it is not true that *all* Chalukyan coins used only Sanskrit inscriptions.  The blank reverse side might have been a stylistic choice, but also could have been due to practical limitations.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct.


**6. With reference to the coinage of Rajput dynasties and the Pandya/Chola dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajput coins, primarily gold, copper, or billon, were characterized by two types: one with the king's name in Sanskrit and a goddess on the reverse, and another featuring a seated bull and a horseman.
2. Pandya coins initially depicted elephants but later shifted to fish as a primary symbol, using Sanskrit inscriptions on gold and silver coins and Tamil inscriptions on copper coins.  Chola coins consistently used Sanskrit inscriptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the coinage of these dynasties. Statement 1 correctly describes the two main types of Rajput coins, highlighting the diversity in their iconography. Statement 2 accurately outlines the evolution of Pandya coinage from elephants to fish and the language used on different metal coins. While Chola coins predominantly used Sanskrit, there might have been exceptions, but the statement's core is accurate. Therefore, both statements are largely correct.


**7.  With reference to the coinage of the Delhi Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Delhi Sultanate coins, adhering to Islamic principles, lacked images of the ruling monarchs, instead featuring inscriptions with the king's name, titles, and Hijri dates.  The introduction of the Tanka (silver) and Jital (copper) is attributed to Iltutmish.
2.  Vijayanagara coins primarily consisted of gold pagodas, with silver taras and copper coins for smaller transactions.  Their designs featured a variety of images, including Hindu deities and symbols like the double-headed eagle.  Krishna Deva Raya's gold varahan coin featured a seated Vishnu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate information about the coinage of these empires. Statement 1 correctly describes the aniconic nature of Delhi Sultanate coins, their inscriptional style, and Iltutmish's role in introducing the Tanka and Jital.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the Vijayanagara coinage system, its metal composition, and the diverse iconography, including the specific example of Krishna Deva Raya's varahan coin.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**8. With reference to Mughal coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal Empire's standard gold coin was the Mohur, roughly equivalent to nine rupees according to Abul Fazl's Ain-i-Akbari, and Akbar introduced both round and square coins, including the Ilahi coins to promote his Din-i-Illahi.
2. Jahangir's coinage frequently incorporated couplets and sometimes included the name of his wife, Noorjahan, and his coins famously featured images of zodiac signs.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of Mughal coinage. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Mohur as the standard gold coin, its value according to Abul Fazl, and Akbar's introduction of various coin types, including the Ilahi coins. Statement 2 correctly points out Jahangir's use of couplets and Noorjahan's name on some coins, as well as the prominent use of zodiac signs.  Therefore, both statements are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements present accurate information regarding early Indian coinage.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Vedic term "Nishka" and Sher Shah Suri's crucial role in introducing the Rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the vast extent of his empire and his practice of directly engaging with his subjects through extensive travel and overnight stays in different parts of his kingdom. This demonstrates his administrative approach and concern for the welfare of his people.  Statement 2 is also accurate; historical accounts indicate that Harshavardhana's religious beliefs evolved, transitioning from the worship of Shiva and Surya to Mahayana Buddhism. This religious shift influenced his policies, resulting in the prohibition of animal slaughter.  Therefore, both statements are historically supported and are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.

Statement 2 is also correct, as Khusrau's literary output includes adaptations of renowned love stories like Laila Majnu and Ashiqa, demonstrating his literary prowess. He is also traditionally attributed, though debated by some scholars, with the invention of the sitar and the integration of Persian and Arabic musical elements into Indian classical music, enriching its diversity.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Archaeological excavations at sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkably organized city layout characterized by a grid pattern of streets intersecting at right angles.  This demonstrates advanced town planning capabilities, including sophisticated drainage systems to manage wastewater.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

Furthermore, the Harappan civilization engaged in extensive trade, as evidenced by the discovery of artifacts and materials from distant regions at various sites.  For instance, the presence of lapis lazuli (from Afghanistan) and Mesopotamian seals indicates far-reaching trade connections.  The Harappans were skilled textile producers, with evidence suggesting the use of cotton. The export of these and other goods contributed significantly to their economy and cultural exchange.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to assist others on their path to enlightenment. This selfless act of compassion is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism, setting it apart from Theravada Buddhism, which focuses more on individual enlightenment through monastic practice.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahayana Buddhism does incorporate lay practitioners, monastic life and individual spiritual practice remain highly significant within the Mahayana tradition.  The pursuit of individual enlightenment, albeit with a focus on universal salvation, continues to be an important aspect of Mahayana Buddhist teachings.  The difference lies primarily in the approach and emphasis—Mahayana prioritizes the Bodhisattva path and helping others, while Theravada emphasizes individual practice and liberation.

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646) left behind a remarkable legacy of temple architecture.  Its temples are known for their grandeur, scale, and intricate carvings.  The inclusion of Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) is a noteworthy feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, reflecting the importance of ritual and ceremony within the empire.  These structures showcase advanced architectural and artistic skills. Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

The Vijayanagara Empire's economy was heavily reliant on agriculture, which was supported by a well-developed irrigation system.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

During the reign of Emperor Jahangir (1605-1627), Mughal art witnessed a significant shift. While illustrated manuscripts remained important, there was a growing emphasis on individual portraiture and album paintings. Jahangir himself was a keen patron of the arts and a skilled painter, influencing the artistic direction of his court. This emphasis on individual portraits reflected a new focus on realism and detailed representation. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Akbar's religious policy was marked by his attempts to promote religious tolerance and harmony within his diverse empire.  He initiated the Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic faith that blended elements of various religions, aiming to foster religious unity.  While Din-i Ilahi did not achieve widespread adoption, it reflects Akbar's efforts to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.

It provides valuable insights into Samudragupta's military conquests, his administrative policies, and his patronage of the arts.  The inscription details his victories over various rulers and kingdoms, offering a glimpse into the political landscape of his time.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

Ashoka's pillars, erected throughout his empire, are significant sources for understanding the Mauryan Empire.  The inscriptions on these pillars, written in Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts, contain Ashoka's edicts outlining his dharma, administrative reforms, and foreign policy.  These edicts provide invaluable information about Ashoka's reign and the Mauryan administration. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.

Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a well-constructed dockyard, indicating the advanced maritime capabilities of the Harappan civilization.  The discovery of various artifacts also points to extensive trade connections with regions like Mesopotamia. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Muziris, located in present-day Kerala, played a crucial role as a major port city in early centuries CE.   It served as a vital link in the trade network connecting India with the Roman Empire, facilitating the exchange of spices, textiles, and other valuable goods.  The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek text, mentions Muziris as a prominent trading center. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.

This sculpture, along with other rock-cut edicts at Dhauli, demonstrates the advanced skills of Mauryan artisans in stone carving.  The Rock-cut Elephant predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were created several centuries later by the Pallava dynasty.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

The Kailasa Temple at Ellora, a monolithic structure carved out of a single rock, is a masterpiece of rock-cut architecture.  This temple, with its intricate carvings and complex design, is a testament to the artistic and engineering capabilities of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, who are credited with its construction in the 8th century CE.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

The Patiala Gharana is another significant gharana known for its emphasis on rhythm and the use of intricate taans (fast melodic runs).  Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, one of the most celebrated vocalists of the 20th century, was a prominent exponent of the Patiala Gharana.  His contributions significantly shaped the style and reputation of this gharana. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.

Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE, left behind a valuable account of Indian society and administration in his work Indica.  Although the original manuscript is lost, fragments and references in later works provide insights into Megasthenes' observations on Indian social structure, political system, and daily life.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

Ibn Battuta, a renowned Moroccan traveler of the 14th century CE, visited India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. His travelogue, Rihla, offers a rich and detailed account of Indian society, culture, and political conditions during that period.  His observations provide valuable insights into various aspects of life in the Delhi Sultanate.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.


**10. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism, spearheaded by figures like Ashoka, played a significant role in disseminating Indian culture and ideas to Southeast Asia and beyond.
2.  Indian maritime trade, through ports like Tamralipti and Muziris, facilitated the exchange of cultural ideas and goods with various regions, contributing to the dissemination of Indian culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The spread of Buddhism from India to various parts of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, was a significant factor in the dissemination of Indian culture and ideas.  Ashoka's missionary activities, coupled with the efforts of Buddhist monks and traders, played a crucial role in establishing Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and beyond.  The spread of Buddhism also led to the transmission of Indian philosophical concepts, art forms, and architectural styles. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Ancient Indian ports, such as Tamralipti (in present-day West Bengal) and Muziris (in present-day Kerala), served as crucial hubs for maritime trade connecting India with various regions.  This extensive trade facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices.  The movement of Indian traders and merchants to different parts of the world contributed significantly to the dissemination of Indian culture. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.



**1. With reference to the Babur's arrival in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's invasion marked the introduction of gunpowder technology to the Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was established in India following Babur's conquest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Babur's arrival in India in 1526 CE is a pivotal moment in Indian history.  Statement 1 is correct because while gunpowder was known in India before Babur, his campaigns significantly introduced and popularized its effective military application, changing the nature of warfare.  His artillery played a crucial role in his victories against Ibrahim Lodi at Panipat. Statement 2 is also correct. Babur's Timurid background profoundly impacted Indian architecture. Although arches and domes existed in pre-Mughal India, Babur's reign and the subsequent Mughal era saw the widespread adoption and refinement of the Timurid architectural style, characterized by its prominent use of arches and domes in mosques, tombs, and palaces.  This style became a defining feature of Mughal architecture and significantly influenced subsequent architectural trends in India. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect historical developments. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually accurate.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and archaeology, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli predates the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves.
2. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is chronologically older than the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), while the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh, dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE).  Therefore, the Dhauli Elephant is considerably older. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram (7th-8th century CE) were created by the Pallava dynasty, while the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, Odisha,  was constructed over centuries, with its major phases falling in the medieval period (particularly between the 11th and 13th centuries CE). Thus, the Rock-cut Monuments are earlier. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the chronological order of these artistic creations.  The question tests the understanding of the relative timelines of different artistic styles and schools in ancient India.


**3. With reference to the locations of pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills.
2. Pushkar is located in the Mahadeo Hills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Omkareshwar, a significant pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, not the Satmala Hills. While the temple is situated in a region with hills, it's not precisely in the Satmala range.  Similarly, Pushkar, famous for its Brahma temple and annual fair, is located in the Aravalli Range in Rajasthan, not in the Mahadeo Hills. The Mahadeo Hills are situated in a different part of India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements misrepresent the geographical locations of these important pilgrimage sites. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geography and location of significant religious places in India.


**4. With reference to Buddhist history, tradition, and culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lhotsava Lakhang Temple is situated in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Spiti Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lhotsava Lakhang Temple is located in Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh, not in the Zanskar Valley.  Statement 2 is correct. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is indeed situated in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, a region known for its rich Buddhist heritage. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 2 accurately identifies the location of a significant Buddhist site.  The question assesses the candidate's familiarity with the geographical distribution of significant Buddhist sites in India.


**5. With reference to the cultural history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchayatan style of temple construction features a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.
2.  The term "Panchayatan" refers to an assembly of village elders in ancient India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Panchayatan style is a distinct architectural feature found in many Hindu temples, characterized by its central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines, creating a specific layout. Statement 2 is incorrect. While "Panchayat" refers to a village council or assembly,  "Panchayatan" specifically denotes the architectural style. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately defines the meaning and application of the term "Panchayatan" within the context of Indian cultural history. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of architectural terminology and its cultural significance.


**6. With reference to Indian art and sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is found in the Ajanta Caves.
2. The Varaha avatar of Vishnu rescuing the earth is depicted in a rock sculpture at Mount Abu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta Caves are renowned for their exquisite murals and sculptures, including the famous depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana (the scene of Buddha's death).  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Varaha avatar is a common theme in Hindu art, the specific large-scale rock sculpture described is not found at Mount Abu.  The major rock sculptures at Mount Abu are primarily associated with Jainism.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately describes the location of a significant work of Indian art. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific artistic representations and their locations.


**7. With reference to Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as Akbar's private chamber for prayer.
2.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri was constructed entirely of marble.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) at Fatehpur Sikri served as a place for Akbar to hold discussions with scholars of various religions, fostering religious debates and dialogues, not solely as a private prayer chamber. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Buland Darwaza is primarily made of red sandstone, not marble.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because both statements present inaccurate information regarding the functions and materials used in the construction of significant structures at Fatehpur Sikri. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Mughal architecture and religious policies.



**8. With reference to the history of Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The caves at Badami are the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India.
2. The Barabar caves were initially constructed for the Ajivikas by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest surviving ones in India. The Barabar caves in Bihar are generally considered to be older. Statement 2 is correct. The Barabar caves, known for their polished interiors, were indeed carved out during the Mauryan period (specifically during the reign of Ashoka's grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya) and were originally intended for the Ajivika sect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical context of these rock-cut caves.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the chronology and religious affiliations associated with early rock-cut cave architecture in India.


**9. With reference to historical places in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Ajanta caves are known for their mural paintings.
2. Lepakshi temple is also recognized for its mural paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta caves are famous for their incredibly well-preserved murals, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and Buddhist narratives. These paintings showcase the high level of artistic skill and sophistication achieved during that period.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Lepakshi temple, located in Andhra Pradesh, also contains significant mural paintings that are notable for their vibrant colors, intricate details and unique artistic style.  These paintings are a testament to the rich artistic traditions of the Vijayanagara empire. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately identify locations known for their mural paintings. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific artistic sites and their associated features.


**10. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The people of the Indus Valley Civilization possessed large palaces and temples.
2. They worshipped both male and female deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization was highly urbanized with sophisticated city planning, clear evidence of large palaces and temples comparable to later periods is lacking.  The structures discovered are more likely public buildings or residential areas.  Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological findings suggest that the Indus people worshipped both male and female deities.  Various artifacts, including seals and figurines, point to a rich religious system with a diverse range of divinities.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 2 is supported by archaeological evidence.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the current scholarly interpretations of the Indus Valley Civilization's societal structure and religious practices.


**11. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut caves, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Chaitya is a place of worship, while a Vihara is a dwelling place for monks.
2. The term "Chaitya" refers to a stupa located at the far end of a cave.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Chaityas were prayer halls or places of worship, often featuring a stupa at the far end, while Viharas were monasteries or residential complexes for monks. Statement 2 is partially correct in that Chaityas often contained a stupa, but the definition is too narrow.  Not all stupas are within Chaityas; many freestanding stupas exist. The defining characteristic of a Chaitya is its function as a place of worship. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 provides an accurate distinction between Chaityas and Viharas. This question tests the candidate's understanding of Buddhist architectural terminology.


**12. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three main racial groups of the Indian subcontinent.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are architectural styles, not racial classifications. They represent distinct regional traditions in temple construction. Statement 2 is correct.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are indeed the three main styles of Indian temple architecture, reflecting regional variations and influences. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately describes the significance of these architectural styles.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the classification and characteristics of Indian temple architecture.


**13. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly a secular civilization with limited religious influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While religious elements existed in the Indus Valley Civilization (as evidenced by artifacts), the overall societal structure appears to have been less overtly dominated by religious institutions compared to later periods.  The emphasis seems to have been more on urban planning, trade, and daily life.  Statement 2 is correct. Evidence from archaeological excavations supports the use of cotton for textile production in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The discovery of cotton fibers and related tools indicates a developed textile industry. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because both statements reflect current scholarly understanding regarding the characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the socio-economic and technological aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.


**14. With reference to Gupta period cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bagh Caves represent one of the two known surviving examples of Gupta period cave paintings in ancient India.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bagh Caves in Madhya Pradesh are indeed one of the two known surviving examples of Gupta period cave paintings in ancient India. These paintings are notable for their vibrant colors and narrative scenes. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The other known surviving example is located in the Ajanta Caves, not the Nasik Caves.  The Nasik caves contain rock-cut structures, but their paintings are not primarily associated with the Gupta period.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 correctly identifies a location of Gupta period cave paintings. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution and characteristics of Gupta period art.


**15. With reference to the location of famous temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple is located in Bhadrachalam.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi, Karnataka, not in Bhadrachalam, Telangana.  Statement 2 is correct. The Vijaya-Vittala Temple in Hampi is indeed famous for its intricately carved 56 pillars, which are said to produce musical notes when struck.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 2 correctly identifies the location of a significant temple. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical locations of significant temples in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Allahabad pillar inscription contains text from several rulers, including Ashoka, it's more prominently associated with Samudragupta.  Statement 2 is correct.  The Maski inscription is indeed significant for being one of the earliest inscriptions to mention Ashoka by name, rather than using titles like "Devanampriya". Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical significance of these inscriptions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of important historical inscriptions and their associated rulers.


**17. With reference to educational institutions in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal is a significant Indus Valley Civilization site, notably known for its well-preserved dockyard, indicating a developed maritime trade network. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kalibangan has yielded important archaeological artifacts, it's not primarily known for a terracotta replica of a plough. That artifact is associated with another site.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the key features of these Indus Valley Civilization sites. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific archaeological findings from the Indus Valley Civilization.


**20. With reference to Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The colossal Gomateshwara statue at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka, is a monumental representation of Bahubali, the last Tirthankara of Jainism. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Arunachal Pradesh has several important Buddhist monasteries, the claim of it housing the largest is debatable and depends on the definition of "largest" (by size, number of monks, or historical significance). Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because only statement 1 is definitively correct. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of religious iconography and the geographical distribution of religious sites in India.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hoysala monuments are primarily found in Halebid and Belur, Karnataka, not in Hampi and Hospet.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebid is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because both statements misrepresent the location and deity associated with significant Hoysala monuments. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution and religious associations of Hoysala architecture.

While not entirely without instances of religious conflict, Akbar's overall approach was more tolerant than many of his predecessors and successors.


Statement 2 is also correct. Jahangir's personal interest in art and his patronage significantly shaped the direction of Mughal painting.  His reign witnessed a shift away from the large-scale illustrated manuscripts that were prevalent under Akbar, towards a greater emphasis on individual portraits, particularly those of himself, his family, and court officials.  The creation of albums containing collections of individual paintings also became a characteristic feature of this period.  This focus on individual portraits reflected not only aesthetic preferences but also the growing importance of royal image and self-representation in the Mughal court.

The precision in construction and the scale of the urban centers highlight the advanced organizational capacity of the Indus people.


Statement 2 is also correct. While the religious beliefs of the Indus people are still debated, evidence suggests a complex religious system with a pantheon of deities. The “Pashupati Seal,” for example, often interpreted as a proto-Shiva figure, is one of the most famous artifacts, indicating the possible worship of a deity with features resembling later Hindu deities.  While interpretations vary, the presence of numerous figurines, seals, and other artifacts with religious connotations points to a developed religious system that was likely integral to the civilization's social and cultural fabric. The diversity of artifacts also hints at a multifaceted religious system rather than a singular deity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE) is renowned for its extensive and high-quality gold coinage.  These coins often depicted images of the ruling emperor performing various activities, such as religious rituals or military campaigns, alongside Hindu deities like Lakshmi.

The Gupta coinage is considered a significant artistic and historical achievement.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Mughal period (16th-18th centuries CE) played a pivotal role in standardizing the rupee as a silver coin.  While the rupee existed in earlier forms, the Mughals established it as a widely accepted and standardized currency unit, which has had a lasting impact on the Indian currency system.  The standardization of the rupee under the Mughals contributed significantly to the stability and efficiency of the empire's economic system.  The legacy of the Mughal rupee is still apparent in the name of the modern Indian currency.


**10. With reference to the  Geographical Indication (GI) tags in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GI tags are granted to products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation linked to that origin.
2.  The GI tag system in India is governed by the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Geographical Indication (GI) tags are a form of intellectual property protection granted to products that are linked to a specific geographical area.  These products must possess qualities or a reputation that is directly attributable to their origin.  The GI tag protects the product's unique identity and reputation, preventing others from misrepresenting their goods as originating from the protected region.  This system aims to safeguard the interests of producers and consumers alike.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The GI tag system in India is largely aligned with the provisions of the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).  TRIPS establishes a minimum standard for the protection of intellectual property, and GI protection falls under this framework.  India's GI tag system thus complies with international norms for the protection of geographical indications, ensuring that Indian products with unique geographical origins receive appropriate legal protection in international trade.  This compliance is essential for safeguarding the interests of Indian producers in the global market.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known Harappan site is Rakhigarhi, located in present-day Haryana.
2.  Chanhudaro, a Harappan site in present-day Pakistan, is notable for its absence of a citadel.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rakhigarhi, situated in Haryana, is currently considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization, surpassing even Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in terms of its overall area and the number of dwellings unearthed.  Extensive excavations have revealed a substantial urban settlement with evidence of sophisticated urban planning, including a grid-like street layout and drainage systems.

Statement 2 is also correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, stands out among other Harappan sites for its unique characteristic: the lack of a prominent citadel.  Unlike many other major Harappan cities, which featured elevated citadels, Chanhudaro seems to have been a relatively egalitarian settlement with a more uniform distribution of dwellings. This absence of a centralized citadel suggests a potentially different social structure or administrative organization compared to other urban centers of the civilization.  The site is, however, known for its skilled craftsmanship, particularly in bead-making.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the deification of the Buddha and the concept of Bodhisattvas.
2.  The practice of image worship and elaborate rituals is central to Mahayana Buddhist traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key distinction between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism lies in the concept of the Buddha. In Mahayana, the Buddha is often viewed as a divine figure, a transcendent being worthy of worship and veneration.  The Bodhisattva ideal, central to Mahayana, emphasizes the path of enlightenment not just for oneself, but for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas postpone their own nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, a concept absent in Theravada Buddhism.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by a more elaborate ritualistic practice and a greater emphasis on image worship.  The use of statues, mandalas, and other visual aids plays a significant role in devotion and meditation.  These practices are intended to facilitate spiritual growth and connection with the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.  This stands in contrast to the more austere and less iconographic approach typically found in Theravada traditions.



**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana Mandapas were a distinctive feature of temple architecture during the Vijayanagara period.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers were primarily patrons of Shaivite religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646) left a lasting legacy in South Indian architecture, particularly in the construction of grand temples.  Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions, were a prominent feature of many Vijayanagara temples. These structures, often elaborately decorated and intricately carved, served as spaces for wedding ceremonies and other auspicious events, reflecting the empire's emphasis on religious and social rituals.  Examples can be found within larger temple complexes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara rulers certainly patronized Shaivite temples, their patronage extended to various religious traditions.  The empire was known for its religious tolerance and support for both Hindu and Jain religious institutions.  The rulers were patrons of Vaishnava, Shakta, and Jain traditions as well, evident in the diverse range of temples and religious structures they built and supported throughout their empire.  Their religious policies promoted a degree of syncretism and coexistence among different faiths.



**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Jahangir is known for shifting the emphasis in court art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.
2.  Mian Tansen, one of Akbar's Navratnas, is credited with inventing numerous ragas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's patronage marked a significant shift in the focus of Mughal court art.  Jahangir, himself a keen observer and patron of the arts, particularly painting, fostered a style that placed greater emphasis on individual portraits, often highly realistic and detailed.  The creation of albums, containing a collection of paintings on various themes, also became more prominent during his reign. This shift reflected a growing interest in capturing individual likenesses and creating more intimate, personal works of art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mian Tansen was indeed a highly accomplished musician and a member of Akbar's Navratnas, he is not credited with inventing numerous ragas.  The development of ragas was a gradual and complex process that spanned centuries and involved many musicians and composers. While Tansen excelled at performing and possibly adapting existing ragas, the claim of inventing a substantial number is not historically supported.  He was renowned for his mastery of existing ragas and his skill in vocal performance.


**5. With reference to the Thanjavur school of painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Thanjavur school of painting received significant patronage from the Maratha rulers.
2.  The Thanjavur school of painting has been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) status for its unique use of gold coating.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Thanjavur (Tanjore) school of painting flourished under the patronage of the Maratha rulers, particularly during the 18th century. The Marathas, after their conquest of the Thanjavur Nayakas, became significant patrons of the art form. This patronage led to a revival and evolution of the Thanjavur style, which is characterized by its rich use of gold and vibrant colors.  The style became associated with the Maratha period and its aesthetic preferences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Thanjavur school of painting is renowned for its extensive and characteristic use of gold leaf, it has not been officially awarded Geographical Indication (GI) status for this specific feature. GI tags are given to products with unique geographical origins and qualities. While the distinctive gold application is a hallmark of the style, the school itself, as a whole artistic tradition, hasn't received this particular recognition.  Other aspects of Indian art and craft have received GI tags but not this specific feature of Thanjavur painting.


**6. With reference to the Satavahana dynasty, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Satavahana dynasty, which ruled in the Deccan region of India, is known for its extensive use of lead in its coinage.  While they did issue some silver and copper coins, lead was the most common metal used for their currency. This reflects the available resources and the prevailing economic conditions of the time.  The relatively inexpensive nature of lead made it suitable for minting large quantities of coins for wider circulation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Satavahana coins are often identifiable by the presence of a distinctive symbol known as the Ujjain symbol. This symbol is depicted as a cross with four circles at the ends of the intersecting lines. The presence of this symbol on many Satavahana coins serves as an important identifier for numismatists and historians studying the dynasty's coinage.  The origin and significance of the symbol remain a subject of discussion among scholars.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gupta Empire (c. 320-550 CE) is renowned for its high-quality gold coinage.  Gold coins formed the bulk of their currency, reflecting the empire's economic prosperity and its access to gold resources. However, they also issued silver and copper coins, catering to various levels of transactions and economic needs within the empire. The prevalence of gold coinage is considered a marker of the Gupta period's economic strength and stability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Gupta coins are notable for their artistic merit and the variety of depictions found on them.  The coins frequently showed the emperor engaged in a range of activities.  These included religious rituals like performing yajnas (sacrifices), playing musical instruments like the veena (a stringed instrument), or engaging in hunting scenes, demonstrating the emperor's role as both a religious leader and a powerful ruler.  These depictions provide valuable insights into the cultural and social life of the Gupta period.


**8. With reference to the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Eastern Chalukya coins predominantly featured the image of a boar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Eastern Chalukya dynasty, which ruled in parts of South India, is known for its coinage which often featured the image of a boar (Varaha). This symbol was prominently displayed on their coins, serving as a significant iconographic element.  The use of the boar likely held religious or symbolic significance for the dynasty, perhaps linked to Vishnu's Varaha avatar.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Eastern Chalukyas established their power in the region of present-day Andhra Pradesh.  Their kingdom extended across parts of what is now Andhra Pradesh and neighboring areas, making them a prominent dynasty in the region's history.  Their rule significantly shaped the political and cultural landscape of Andhra Pradesh during their period.  Their capital was initially Vengi, located in Andhra Pradesh.


**9. With reference to the Rajput dynasties, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Rajput dynasties, which ruled various parts of North India, issued coins primarily in gold and copper.  Silver coins were less common during their period. This reflects the availability of resources and the preferred metals used for currency in their respective regions. The relative scarcity of silver coins compared to gold and copper coins is a significant characteristic of Rajput coinage.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A notable feature of some Rajput coins was the depiction of the king's name in Sanskrit on one side and a Hindu goddess on the other. This combination reflects the religious and political ideology of the Rajput rulers, who often emphasized their royal lineage and their connection to Hindu deities.  The specific deities depicted varied depending on the dynasty and the ruler.  This practice is a significant feature distinguishing Rajput coinage.


**10. With reference to the Chola dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early Chola coins often featured the image of an elephant.
2.  The coins of Raja Raja I and Rajendra I featured inscriptions primarily in Tamil.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The early Chola coins often included the image of an elephant, a significant symbol in South Indian iconography and often associated with royalty and power. The elephant's presence on their coinage reflected the Chola's cultural identity and their status as a powerful ruling dynasty.  Over time, other symbols also appeared on their coins.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cholas did use Tamil in some of their inscriptions and administrative documents, the coins of Raja Raja I and Rajendra I predominantly featured inscriptions in Sanskrit.  Although Tamil was a significant language of their kingdom, the use of Sanskrit on their coinage was more common, reflecting the broader cultural and linguistic context of their interactions with other parts of India.  The use of Sanskrit on the coinage was common in many South Indian kingdoms.


**11. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Iltutmish introduced the silver tanka and copper jital as standard currency.
2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's attempt to introduce token currency was a resounding success.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Iltutmish, a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, is credited with introducing the silver tanka and the copper jital as standard units of currency. These coins became widely circulated within the Sultanate and played a significant role in its economic system. The introduction of these standardized coins helped to regulate trade and commerce within the kingdom.  The tanka and jital became important elements of the Sultanate's economic structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's experiment with token currency, introducing bronze and copper coins as substitutes for silver and gold, proved to be a major failure. The token currency scheme was poorly implemented and lacked public trust, causing significant economic disruption. The scheme led to widespread inflation and economic instability within the Sultanate and is often cited as one of the contributing factors to his downfall.  It is a well-known example of a failed economic policy in history.


**12. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire primarily issued gold coins, with silver and copper coins being less common.
2.  Vijayanagara coins often depicted Hindu deities along with symbols such as a double-headed eagle.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646) is known for its extensive gold coinage.  Gold formed the primary metal used for their currency, reflecting the empire's wealth and access to gold resources.  While they also issued silver and copper coins, gold coins dominated their monetary system.  The large-scale production of gold coins was a significant aspect of their economic policy.

Statement 2 is also correct. Vijayanagara coins frequently featured depictions of Hindu deities and various symbols, including a double-headed eagle.  The use of these images and symbols reflects the empire's religious and cultural identity.  The double-headed eagle, in particular, is often considered a significant symbol in Vijayanagara iconography, though its precise meaning continues to be debated among scholars.  The choice of symbols varied depending on the specific ruler and the mint where the coins were produced.


**13. With reference to the Mughal coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standard gold coin of the Mughals was the Mohur, equivalent to nine rupees.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Mohur was the standard gold coin of the Mughal Empire.  According to Abul Fazl's Ain-i-Akbari, a Mohur was equivalent to nine rupees. This establishes the Mohur as a significant unit of currency within the Mughal monetary system.  The value of the Mohur, relative to other coins, is a key fact in understanding Mughal economics.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Akbar, in an attempt to promote religious harmony and possibly consolidate his power, introduced a new religious creed known as Din-i-Illahi.  As part of this initiative, he issued special gold coins known as Ilahi coins. These coins carried inscriptions reflecting the principles of Din-i-Illahi.  The issuance of these coins demonstrates Akbar's attempt to use his authority to promote his religious syncretic ideas.


**14. With reference to the pre-historic paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh contain paintings from the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Chalcolithic periods.
2.  The paintings at Bhimbetka primarily depict scenes of hunting, warfare, and daily life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhimbetka rock shelters, located in Madhya Pradesh, are renowned for their extensive collection of rock paintings, representing a remarkable continuity of artistic expression across various periods.  Archaeological evidence indicates that the paintings span a vast timeframe, including the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Chalcolithic periods.  The superposition of paintings from different eras makes Bhimbetka a unique site for studying the evolution of pre-historic art.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bhimbetka paintings vividly depict various aspects of the lives of pre-historic humans.  Hunting scenes, often featuring animals like elephants and bisons, are common motifs.  Scenes of warfare, showcasing weapons and conflict, are also present.  Alongside these, the paintings depict aspects of daily life, including community gatherings, dancing, music-making, and other activities providing valuable insights into the social and cultural practices of pre-historic communities.



**15. With reference to the Ajanta cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ajanta cave paintings primarily depict scenes from the Jataka tales and the life of the Buddha.
2.  The Ajanta murals predominantly utilize the fresco technique, painting on wet plaster.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ajanta cave paintings are renowned for their exquisite depictions of scenes from the Jataka tales, narratives recounting the previous lives of the Buddha.  These paintings also illustrate events from the Buddha's own life, his teachings, and his followers. The Jataka tales are a significant part of Buddhist literature and their depiction in the Ajanta murals illustrates their importance in Buddhist culture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta murals do include some fresco elements, the dominant technique employed is tempera painting. Tempera involves the use of pigments mixed with a binder, typically egg yolk, applied to a dry surface.  While some areas might show fresco-like qualities due to the absorption of pigments, the overall technique is predominantly tempera, a significant difference in the approach to painting.  The use of tempera painting is a key aspect of the Ajanta artistic style.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Kanganahalli inscriptions, located in Karnataka, feature a stone sculpture of King Ashoka and his queen, accompanied by chauri bearers, with the inscription "Rayo Ashoka" in Brahmi script.
2. The Aihole inscription, written in Sanskrit using the Kannada script, details the Chalukya dynasty's victory over the Pallavas and Harshavardhana, and the subsequent shift of the capital from Aihole to Badami.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Kanganahalli site in Karnataka is indeed known for its significant Buddhist remains, including a large stupa and sculptural slabs.  A key finding is the stone portrait of King Ashoka and his queen, with attendant chauri bearers, and the inscription "Rayo Ashoka" written in Brahmi script, confirming the sculpture's identity. This inscription is a crucial piece of evidence linking the site to the Mauryan period.  The Brahmi script used is consistent with the Satavahana period, further supporting the historical context.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Aihole inscription, located in the Meguti Temple in Karnataka, is a valuable historical record of the Chalukya dynasty.  The inscription, written in Sanskrit using the Kannada script, provides details about significant events in the dynasty's history, including Pulakeshin II's victories over Harshavardhana and the Pallavas, and the subsequent relocation of the capital from Aihole to Badami.  The inscription's author, Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakeshin II, further authenticates its historical context and significance.  The events described are well-documented within the broader history of the period.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. Satavahana coins, predominantly made of lead, often featured an elephant, horse, lion, or chaitya on one side and the Ujjain symbol on the other, with inscriptions in Prakrit.
2.  Gupta gold coins frequently depicted the emperor engaged in various activities—performing rituals, playing the veena, hunting—while the reverse side often showcased Goddess Lakshmi or the queen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the characteristics of Satavahana coinage.  The Satavahanas, ruling from the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE, primarily used lead for their coins, although silver and copper coins also existed.  Their coins often featured animal motifs (elephant, horse, lion) or religious symbols (chaitya), alongside the distinctive Ujjain symbol.  The language used for inscriptions was Prakrit, reflecting the linguistic landscape of the period.  The lack of artistic sophistication in these coins is also a well-established fact, yet their historical value remains significant.

Statement 2 correctly describes a common feature of Gupta coinage. The Gupta Empire (4th-6th centuries CE) is renowned for its high-quality gold coinage. These coins frequently depicted the emperor in a variety of contexts—performing religious ceremonies, playing musical instruments (like the veena), engaged in hunting or warfare. The reverse side often displayed images of Goddess Lakshmi, the queen, or other significant figures. The use of Sanskrit and the Brahmi script on Gupta coins marked a significant shift in numismatic conventions.  This artistic and technical excellence contrasts sharply with the simpler Satavahana coins.


**3. With reference to Sangam literature, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is historically accurate.  The Sangam period, a significant era in Tamil literary history, is characterized by a large body of work produced over several centuries.  Estimates place the total number of poems in the extant Sangam corpus at approximately 2,381, attributed to around 473 poets, a testament to the flourishing literary culture of the time.  A substantial portion of these poems remain anonymous, highlighting the widespread participation in the literary tradition. While the exact dating remains debated by scholars, the approximate timeframe is generally accepted.

Statement 2 is also correct. Avvaiyar is a well-known and revered female poet of the Sangam period whose works are included in the Sangam anthology.  Thiruvalluvar's *Tirukkural*, a highly influential work of Tamil literature, is also a key part of the Sangam tradition. Its division into three sections focusing on virtue, wealth, and love, and its subsequent translations into numerous languages, underscore its enduring significance and widespread appeal. The inclusion of both male and female voices in Sangam literature reflects a broader social context.


**4. Consider the following statements about Indian temple architecture:**

1.  The Nagara style, prevalent in Northern India from the 5th century CE onwards, featured Panchayatan layouts, mandapas, and shikharas of varying types (Latina, Phamsana, Valabhi), often topped with an amalaka and kalasha.
2. The Odisha sub-school of Nagara architecture is characterized by lavish exterior carvings, the absence of pillars in the porch (using iron girders instead), and a distinctive rekha deul shikhara that sharply curves inwards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines key features of the Nagara style of temple architecture.  This style, dominant in northern India from the 5th century CE onward, is characterized by its distinct structural elements. The Panchayatan plan, with its central shrine and four subsidiary shrines, is a common feature.  Mandapas (assembly halls) were integral to the temple complex. The shikharas (towers) exhibited variations in form, with Latina, Phamsana, and Valabhi types being prominent examples.  The amalaka (a fluted disc) and kalasha (a pot-shaped finial) were common crowning elements, reflecting a distinct aesthetic sensibility.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Odisha sub-school of Nagara architecture. This regional variant of the Nagara style presents unique characteristics. Lavish exterior ornamentation contrasts with plainer interior walls.  The absence of pillars in the porch, instead using iron girders for support, is a distinguishing feature. The rekha deul shikhara, with its almost vertical rise and sharp inward curve, is iconic of Odisha temple architecture.  The use of iron girders showcases advanced engineering skills of the time.  Examples like the Sun Temple at Konark illustrate these characteristics.


**5. With reference to the history of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mauryan period witnessed the creation of monumental architecture like palaces at Pataliputra and Kumrahar, characterized by the use of wood as the primary building material, and the erection of numerous stupas and pillars.
2.  Post-Mauryan art saw the development of distinct schools of sculpture—Gandhara, Mathura, and Amaravati—each exhibiting unique stylistic features influenced by regional and external factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the architectural achievements of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas, known for their centralized administration and imperial power, constructed large-scale structures, including palaces at Pataliputra (their capital) and Kumrahar. Wood was a primary building material, although stone was also utilized.  The construction of numerous stupas and pillars, often inscribed with edicts, served both religious and propagandistic purposes.  Megasthenes' accounts provide valuable insights into the grandeur of Mauryan palaces.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The post-Mauryan period witnessed a flourishing of artistic activity, with the emergence of distinct schools of sculpture. The Gandhara school, located in the northwest, exhibited Greco-Buddhist influences. The Mathura school, in the central Gangetic plains, developed its own style. The Amaravati school, in the south, had distinct characteristics.  These schools are distinguished by their materials, iconography, and stylistic preferences, reflecting the diverse cultural and artistic interactions of the time. The development of these distinct regional styles reflects the decentralized political landscape that followed the Mauryan empire.


**1. With reference to the Timurid dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival in India marked the beginning of the Timurid dynasty's rule in the region.
2. The Timurid dynasty's architectural contributions included the widespread introduction of the arch and dome.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur, a Timurid prince, established the Mughal Empire in India, marking the beginning of the Timurid dynasty's rule in the subcontinent.  While elements of Timurid architectural style existed in India prior to Babur, his establishment of the empire solidified its presence and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Babur and subsequent Mughal rulers did utilize arches and domes in their architecture, it's inaccurate to state they introduced these architectural elements to the region.  Arches and domes were already present in Indian architecture, particularly in Indo-Islamic styles that preceded the Mughals.  The Mughals refined and expanded upon existing techniques, incorporating Persian influences, but didn't introduce the foundational concepts themselves.  The statement oversimplifies a complex architectural evolution. The assertion of widespread introduction is a significant exaggeration.  Many structures throughout India already employed arches and domes before the Timurids.


**2. With reference to early Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar predates the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BC), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed during the Somavamsi period (around the 11th century AD). The statement incorrectly reverses the chronological order of these structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, created during the Gupta period (5th century AD), precedes the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were constructed by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th century AD.  The statement accurately reflects the relative ages of these sculptural works.  The Gupta period is earlier than the Pallava period in Indian history.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayatan style is a distinctive architectural feature of many Indian temples, characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, often arranged symmetrically. The statement accurately describes this architectural arrangement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While "Panchayat" refers to an assembly of village elders, "Panchayatan" specifically denotes the aforementioned temple architectural style. The statement confuses the terms and their meanings.  The addition of "-yatan" significantly alters the meaning.

Archaeological excavations at these sites have revealed evidence of sophisticated urban planning, including grid-like street layouts, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, characteristic of Harappan cities. Statement 2 is also correct. Sohgaura is known for its important archaeological discoveries, but these belong to a later period (Mauryan) than the Harappan Civilization. The copper plate inscription found at Sohgaura is a significant artifact of the Mauryan era, not the Indus Valley Civilization.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the archaeological evidence and understanding of the Harappan Civilization and other contemporaneous cultures.

These elaborate structures, often found within larger temple complexes, served as wedding pavilions and showcased the empire's artistic and architectural prowess.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rashtrakutas were a significant dynasty preceding the Vijayanagara Empire, Kalyana Mandapas are not a defining characteristic of their temple architecture.  The architectural styles of the Rashtrakutas differed from those of the Vijayanagara period.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the known features of Vijayanagara and Rashtrakuta architecture. The distinct architectural features of different dynasties are important for understanding the broader cultural and historical context of South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar was a significant patron of the arts and oversaw the creation of numerous illustrated manuscripts, it was his successor, Jahangir, who notably shifted the emphasis in Mughal art. Jahangir's own artistic inclinations and his court's preference led to a greater focus on individual portraits, often highly detailed and realistic, and the compilation of albums showcasing various artistic works. Statement 2 is correct.  Jahangir continued the tradition of illustrated manuscripts begun under Akbar, but he significantly expanded and refined the artistic styles and subject matter.  The combination of manuscript illustration and individual portraits defined the artistic landscape under Jahangir's reign.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alvars were a group of twelve poet-saints in the South Indian Bhakti movement, but they were primarily devoted to Lord Vishnu, not Shiva.  Their devotional poetry, known as Divya Prabandham, celebrated Vishnu and his avatars, especially Krishna. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Nayanmars were another group of Tamil saints within the Bhakti movement, but their devotion was directed towards Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Their devotional hymns, compiled in the Tevaram, are a cornerstone of Shaivite literature.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the devotional focus of the Alvars and Nayanmars.  Distinguishing between the Alvars and Nayanmars and their respective deities is essential for a complete understanding of the diverse expressions of the Bhakti movement in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Satavahana coinage is characterized by the predominant use of lead, with silver coins being a relatively less frequent find. While they did use other metals like copper and potin (a silver-copper alloy), lead was the most common material for their coins. This is a notable feature differentiating their coinage from other contemporary dynasties. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gupta Empire, known for its economic prosperity, is famous for its extensive gold coinage. While they did issue silver and copper coins, gold was the dominant metal used in their coinage. This reflects their relative wealth and the importance of gold as a medium of exchange in their period. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical evidence concerning the coinage practices of the Satavahana and Gupta empires.  The study of ancient Indian coinage provides valuable insights into the economic and political conditions of the times.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nicolo De Conti, a Venetian traveler, visited India in the 15th century and in his writings he notably described the Telugu language as the "Italian of the East," highlighting its perceived elegance and sophistication in comparison to European languages. This reflects his personal impressions and observations during his travels. Statement 2 is also correct. Abdur Razzaq, a Persian traveler and scholar, visited the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century and left behind a valuable account of the empire during the reign of Devaraya II. His observations offer insights into the political, economic, and social aspects of the Vijayanagara court and society.  Both statements reflect accurate details from the accounts of these early foreign travelers.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the historical record of these travelers' observations.  The writings of foreign travelers are invaluable for reconstructing a comprehensive picture of India's past.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, in his writings described the magnificence of the Mauryan palaces at Pataliputra.  Although the palaces were largely made of wood, his account highlights their scale and grandeur, considering them among the world's greatest architectural feats. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ashoka's pillars did indeed propagate imperial edicts, they were not exclusively focused on Buddhist teachings. The edicts covered a range of topics, including dharma, social conduct, and administrative matters, reflecting a broader imperial message rather than a strictly Buddhist one.  The pillars were made of Chunar sandstone, not granite. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical evidence concerning Mauryan architecture and Ashoka's pillars. The analysis of Mauryan art and architecture offers valuable insights into the cultural and technological capabilities of the empire.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Thanjavur school of painting, known for its vibrant colors and intricate details, flourished under the patronage of Maratha rulers.  Their support played a crucial role in the development and growth of this distinct style of South Indian painting. Statement 2 is also correct. The Thanjavur style of painting has indeed been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) status by the Government of India. This recognition protects the unique aspects of this painting style, particularly its characteristic application of gold leaf, ensuring its authenticity and preventing imitation.  Both statements accurately reflect the historical context and contemporary recognition of the Thanjavur school of painting.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the facts. The GI tag for Thanjavur painting is a significant aspect of its cultural preservation and economic viability.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abanindranath Tagore is widely recognized as a pivotal figure in the establishment and development of the Bengal School of Art.

While Rabindranath Tagore is primarily known for his literary contributions, he was also involved with the Bengal School of Art, albeit indirectly. His influence and support for the school's ideals contributed to its overall growth and recognition.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical roles of Abanindranath and Rabindranath Tagore in relation to the Bengal School of Art.  Understanding the key figures and their contributions is essential for analysing the development and impact of this important art movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Babur's invasion of India in 1526 marked a turning point in Indian military history. His army's effective use of gunpowder weaponry, including cannons and firearms, proved decisive in battles against larger, more established armies. This introduction of advanced artillery and firearms significantly altered the balance of power and influenced military strategies for centuries to come.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Furthermore, Babur's architectural legacy is evident in the introduction and widespread adoption of Timurid architectural elements within India. While arches and domes existed in India prior to his arrival, Babur's patronage and the influx of Timurid artisans led to a distinct shift in style, particularly in the design of mosques, tombs, and palaces. The use of these elements became a hallmark of Mughal architecture and influenced subsequent architectural developments across the subcontinent. Thus, statement 2 is also correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves is associated with the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the Dhauli elephant dates back to the Mauryan era.  The Mauryan period precedes the Gupta period, placing the Dhauli sculpture earlier in the timeline of Indian art history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rakhigarhi, situated in Haryana, is currently considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization, surpassing Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in terms of size and extent of excavation.  The extensive excavations have revealed a large settlement, indicating a significant urban center of the Harappan civilization.  The discovery of numerous residential structures, granaries, and drainage systems supports its importance as a major city.


Statement 2 is correct.  While horse remains are not commonly found at most Harappan sites, the westernmost site, Suktagandor (located in present-day Pakistan), has yielded evidence of horse bones, suggesting the presence of horses in that specific region during the Harappan period. This finding provides valuable insight into the animal domestication and potential use of horses in the western periphery of the civilization.  The presence of horses at Suktagandor might indicate trade connections or interactions with regions where horses were more prevalent.  The limited evidence, however, suggests that horses were not a widespread or integral part of the Harappan civilization as a whole.

1.  The concept of Bodhisattvas is central to Mahayana Buddhism, emphasizing the path of enlightenment through compassion and helping others achieve Nirvana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of Bodhisattvas—enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.  This emphasis on compassion and selfless service distinguishes Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism. The Bodhisattva ideal profoundly impacted Mahayana Buddhist art and literature, depicting Bodhisattvas as compassionate figures embodying the path to enlightenment through helping others.  The Bodhisattva path is a key element in understanding Mahayana's philosophical and spiritual framework.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by the practice of image worship and the performance of elaborate rituals.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism's focus on individual practice and meditation, Mahayana incorporates devotional practices centered around images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.  These rituals and the veneration of images are considered essential aspects of Mahayana Buddhist practice, aiming to foster devotion and spiritual growth. The development of elaborate rituals and image worship is a significant departure from the earlier forms of Buddhism and reflects the evolving nature of the religion.



**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Vijayanagara Empire is renowned for its distinctive temple architecture.  Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions, were a prominent feature within many temple complexes. These structures were often elaborately decorated and served as spaces for wedding ceremonies and other important rituals.  The inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas reflects the empire's emphasis on royal patronage of religious architecture and the integration of royal ceremonies within the temple context.  The presence of these structures in numerous Vijayanagara temples provides valuable insight into the social and religious life of the time.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara rulers were primarily patrons of Hindu religious institutions and temples. While Jainism existed within the empire, the vast majority of royal patronage went towards constructing and maintaining Hindu temples.  Numerous large and ornate temples built during the Vijayanagara period showcase the empire's strong association with Hinduism.  The architectural style, iconography, and inscriptions within these temples clearly demonstrate the religious preferences of the rulers and the dominant religious landscape of the empire.  The vast number of Hindu temples built during this period contrasts sharply with the statement's assertion.



**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mian Tansen was given his title by Emperor Akbar and was renowned for composing Dhrupads on Hindu deities.
2.  Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Tansen, one of the Navratnas (nine gems) in Akbar's court, was indeed given the title "Mian" by the emperor.  He was a highly accomplished musician, known for his expertise in Dhrupad, a form of Hindustani classical music.  While his compositions encompassed various themes, he is also known to have created Dhrupads dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses, reflecting the religious tolerance and syncretism prevalent during Akbar's reign.  His musical contributions significantly influenced the development of Hindustani classical music.


Statement 2 is correct.  While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's patronage marked a shift in Mughal artistic focus.  Jahangir, himself a keen artist and connoisseur, showed a strong preference for individual portraits, often incorporating detailed depictions of flora and fauna.  The creation of albums, containing collections of individual paintings, also gained prominence during his reign.  This shift reflected a change in artistic sensibilities and a greater emphasis on naturalistic representation and individual expression within the context of Mughal art.  The development of individual portraiture became a hallmark of Mughal art under Jahangir's patronage.


**5. With reference to foreign travelers to India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's detailed account of his travels, "Rihla," provides insights into 14th-century India, including its social and cultural life, and mentions the efficiency of the postal system.
2.  Nicolo de Conti, an Italian traveler, visited the Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Devaraya II and described the Telugu language as the "Italian of the East."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ibn Battuta's "Rihla" is a rich source of information about 14th-century India. His detailed observations cover various aspects of Indian society, culture, and daily life.  He provides descriptions of cities, customs, and even the postal system, highlighting its efficiency in communication and trade.  His account offers valuable insights into the political, social, and economic conditions of India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The meticulous nature of his descriptions makes "Rihla" a significant historical document.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nicolo de Conti did travel to India and visit the Vijayanagara Empire, his visit occurred during the reign of Devaraya I, not Devaraya II.   Furthermore, while he did comment on the region's wealth and culture, there's no historical record of him describing Telugu as the "Italian of the East." This detail is likely a misattribution or a conflation with another traveler's account.  The accurate details of his travels and observations are important to distinguish from any later embellishments or inaccuracies.




**6. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara style of temple architecture, prevalent in North India, features shikharas that vary in shape from pyramidal to curvilinear.
2.  The Odisha school, a sub-school within the Nagara style, is characterized by the use of pillars in the porch and lavish interior wall carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nagara style, a significant architectural style in North India, is characterized by its distinctive shikharas (towers).  These shikharas exhibit a variety of shapes, ranging from pyramidal to curvilinear forms. The evolution of shikhara styles reflects regional variations and the development of architectural techniques over time.  The diversity of shikhara forms is a key characteristic in distinguishing different sub-schools within the broader Nagara style.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Odisha school, a prominent sub-school of the Nagara style, is known for its *lack* of pillars in the porch.  Instead of pillars, they used iron girders to support the roof. While the exterior walls of Odisha temples are indeed lavishly decorated with intricate carvings, the interior walls are generally kept plain.  These features help to distinguish the Odisha school from other sub-schools within the Nagara style of architecture. The use of iron girders and the plain interior walls are unique traits of Odisha temple architecture.


**7. With reference to the accounts of foreign travelers in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Al-Biruni's "Kitab-ul-Hind" is a comprehensive work that covers a wide range of topics, including religion, philosophy, astronomy, and social life in India.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Al-Biruni's "Kitab-ul-Hind" is a monumental work that offers a detailed and insightful account of India during the early medieval period.  It covers a vast array of subjects, including religious beliefs and practices, philosophical schools, astronomical knowledge, social customs, and political systems.  Al-Biruni's meticulous research and comparative approach make his work a crucial source for understanding various aspects of Indian society and culture during his time.  The breadth and depth of his coverage are remarkable for a foreign observer of the period.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Megasthenes' "Indica" does provide some information about the Mauryan Empire, the details regarding its military organization and strategies are not particularly comprehensive or detailed.   The surviving fragments of "Indica" focus more on the social, political, and geographical aspects of the Mauryan Empire than on military matters.  Other sources provide more substantial information on the Mauryan military.  The limitations of the surviving text of "Indica" need to be considered when evaluating its specific claims.



**8. With reference to the Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gupta period witnessed the development of the distinctive Nagara style of temple architecture, featuring a square sanctum and a pillared portico.

(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The development of the Nagara style, with its characteristic square sanctum and pillared portico, began during this era.  This architectural style laid the foundation for many subsequent temple designs in North India.

2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was fully established in India only after Babur's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's campaigns did significantly utilize gunpowder weaponry, the substance itself was already present in India, albeit perhaps not as widely adopted or sophisticated in military applications.  Gunpowder had been used in India for centuries before Babur’s arrival, its use in fireworks, and some rudimentary forms of weaponry predating his arrival by several centuries.  The impact of Babur's use of gunpowder was to significantly modernize and improve its military application in India, not to introduce it.

Statement 2 is correct. Although the Timurids had used arches and domes, the full flourishing of this architectural style in India occurred after Babur's death and under the subsequent Mughal emperors. Babur's own architectural projects were relatively modest and more focused on establishing his power and control rather than a sweeping architectural revolution.  The truly grand and innovative use of arches and domes, which significantly shaped Indian architecture, came later in the Mughal period. The evolution of Timurid architecture in India was a gradual process, not a sudden transformation upon Babur's arrival.  His rule laid the foundation, but the full impact was felt later.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar predates the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves is contemporary with the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is considerably older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was built during the Kalinga dynasty, considerably later in the 11th-12th century CE.  The Dhauli elephant represents a much earlier stage of Indian rock-cut architecture, while the Lingaraja Temple exemplifies a later, more developed style of temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th-8th century CE. These two artistic achievements, while both significant examples of Indian sculpture, are separated by a substantial timeframe.  The Gupta art style differs significantly from that of the Pallavas, reflecting the evolution of artistic sensibilities and techniques over time.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Srisailam is located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh, not the Satmala Hills.  The Nallamala range is known for its dense forests and several important pilgrimage sites.  The geographic location is a key element in understanding the significance of Srisailam within its regional context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Omkareshwar is situated on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, not in the Nallamala Hills.  The location of Omkareshwar on the Narmada River is integral to its religious and mythological importance.  The specific geographical setting influences the temple's design and cultural significance.  Confusing it with the Nallamala Hills demonstrates a misunderstanding of its actual location.


**4. With reference to Buddhist shrines in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lhotsava Lakhang Temple at Nako is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in Spiti Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lhotsava Lakhang Temple at Nako is located in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, not in the Zanskar Valley of Ladakh. The geographical location is crucial to understanding the temple's architectural style and cultural influences.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Panchayats are village councils, the term "Panchayatan" in the context of Indian art and architecture specifically refers to a style of temple construction, not a village governance structure.  The term's usage is distinct and requires understanding its specific meaning within the architectural domain.

Statement 2 is correct. The Panchayatan style is indeed characterized by a central shrine, representing the primary deity, surrounded by four smaller shrines, dedicated to associated deities or aspects of the central deity. This arrangement reflects specific cosmological and religious beliefs.  Understanding this architectural feature is essential for interpreting the design and meaning of temples built in this style.


**6. With reference to Indian sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta Caves feature a large sculpture depicting the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha with celestial musicians and grieving followers.
2. A massive Varaha avatar sculpture rescuing the earth goddess is found at Mamallapuram.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta Caves do indeed contain a significant painting (not a sculpture) depicting the Mahaparinirvana of the Buddha, with the characteristic inclusion of celestial musicians and the sorrowful figures of his followers.  This depiction is a highly significant example of Buddhist art and reflects the artistic conventions of the period.  The emphasis on painting rather than sculpture in Ajanta is a key feature of the site's artistic legacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mamallapuram features impressive rock-cut sculptures, including depictions of the Descent of the Ganga, a massive Varaha avatar sculpture rescuing the earth goddess is found at Udayagiri Caves, not Mamallapuram. The Udayagiri Varaha is a significant example of Gupta-era sculpture, reflecting distinct artistic conventions and stylistic features.  Attributing this sculpture to Mamallapuram shows a confusion regarding the geographical location and stylistic attributes of important Indian sculptures.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar certainly used the Ibadat Khana for prayer, its primary function was not solely as his private prayer chamber.  Its design and purpose were more multifaceted.  The building's architecture and historical context suggest a broader purpose than simply private devotion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana was indeed a significant venue for religious discussions and debates involving scholars of diverse faiths, reflecting Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in exploring different theological perspectives.  This function is well-documented in historical accounts and is crucial to understanding the Ibadat Khana's historical significance.  Its role in fostering interfaith dialogue was a key aspect of Akbar's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves, known for their unique architectural features, were indeed originally built for the Ajivikas during the Mauryan period under Chandragupta Maurya.  The caves' construction and dedication reflect the religious patronage of the Mauryan empire and the architectural styles of the era.  The association with the Ajivikas is a significant historical detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are important examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest surviving ones in India. The Barabar caves predate them considerably.  The claim that Badami caves are the oldest reflects a misunderstanding of the chronological sequence of rock-cut cave development in India.  Understanding the relative chronology of these sites is crucial for tracing the evolution of rock-cut architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta caves are world-famous for their well-preserved and vibrant mural paintings, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and other Buddhist narratives. These paintings are considered masterpieces of Indian art and represent a significant contribution to the history of painting.  Their artistic merit and historical importance are widely recognized.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lepakshi temple also boasts remarkable mural paintings that showcase a blend of artistic styles and themes. These paintings, while perhaps less famous than those at Ajanta, are equally significant for understanding the development of South Indian art.  Their unique features and artistic qualities contribute to the cultural heritage of the region.


**10. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The people of the Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization practiced a form of religion that involved the worship of both male and female deities.  The discovery of various artifacts and figurines provides insight into their religious beliefs and practices.  The evidence of both male and female deities challenges simplistic interpretations of their religious system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization possessed domesticated animals, there's no conclusive evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots for warfare.  The presence of horses is debated, and their use in warfare remains unproven.  The assertion of widespread chariot warfare is an overinterpretation of the available archaeological data.


**11. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut caves, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chaityas were primarily used as dwelling places for monks.
2. Viharas served as places of worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Chaityas were primarily used as places of worship, often featuring a stupa at the far end.  Viharas, on the other hand, served as dwelling places for monks.  Confusing the function of these two types of caves reflects a misunderstanding of their distinct roles within Buddhist monastic life.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Viharas served as dwelling places for monks, providing living quarters, not as places of worship.  Chaityas were the structures specifically designed for religious practices and rituals.  The distinction between Chaityas and Viharas is fundamental to understanding Buddhist monastic architecture.


**12. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

2.  The three main racial groups of the Indian subcontinent are reflected in the Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are indeed three major and distinct regional styles of Indian temple architecture.  Each style exhibits unique characteristics in terms of their structural features, decorative elements, and overall design principles.  Understanding these styles is essential for analyzing and interpreting Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are not associated with distinct racial groups.  These architectural styles developed and evolved based on regional influences, material availability, and cultural preferences.  Linking them to racial groups is a misinterpretation and a simplification of the complex cultural and historical factors that shaped these architectural traditions.


**13. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly a secular civilization with minimal religious influence.
2. Cotton was used for textile manufacturing during the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While evidence of religious practices exists, the Indus Valley Civilization does not show a dominant religious element like later civilizations.  The limited evidence of religious iconography and the lack of large-scale religious structures suggest a less religiously centralized society compared to later periods.  The relative lack of emphasis on religious structures in urban planning points to a secular aspect.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings confirm the use of cotton for textile production in the Indus Valley Civilization. The discovery of cotton fibers and textile remnants provides strong evidence for this aspect of their material culture.  The evidence of sophisticated textile production indicates a developed technological capability and a significant role of textiles in their society.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A dockyard was discovered at Lothal, not Kalibangan. Lothal's location on the coast and the presence of a dockyard provide significant evidence of the Harappan Civilization's maritime activities.  Attributing the dockyard to Kalibangan demonstrates a misunderstanding of the geographical distribution of Harappan sites.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  An inscription with 10 large signs was found at Dholavira, not Lothal. Dholavira's inscription is significant for providing insights into the Harappan script.  Associating it with Lothal shows a lack of familiarity with the specific findings at different Harappan sites.

The statue's immense size and artistic merit make it a significant landmark of Jain art and religious history.  Its cultural and religious significance is widely recognized.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Arunachal Pradesh has several important Buddhist monasteries, the largest is not located there.  The claim regarding the location of India's largest Buddhist monastery reflects a lack of accurate information.  The precise location of the largest monastery requires further verification and might depend on the definition of "largest."


**21. With reference to the location of Hoysala monuments, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala monuments are found in Hampi and Hospet.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hampi and Hospet are associated with Vijayanagara architecture, not Hoysala architecture.  The architectural styles of Vijayanagara and Hoysala are distinct and reflect different historical periods and cultural influences.  Confusing their geographical association shows a lack of understanding of South Indian architectural history.

Statement 2 is correct. Halebid and Belur are indeed well-known for their remarkable Hoysala temples, which showcase the unique artistic and architectural achievements of the Hoysala dynasty.  These temples are significant examples of Hoysala art and represent a high point of South Indian temple architecture.  Their exquisite carvings and structural features are widely admired.

While the depiction of cows is debated among scholars, there is some evidence suggesting that cows were represented in Harappan art, although not as prominently as some other animals.  The interpretation of animal representations in Harappan art is a subject of ongoing scholarly discussion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While various animals were depicted in Harappan art, tigers were not commonly represented.  The statement reflects an inaccurate understanding of the types of animals commonly shown in Harappan seals and terracotta art.  The range of animals depicted in Harappan art is well-documented, and the absence of tigers is a significant point.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Phad painting is associated with Rajasthan, not Karnataka.  Phad paintings are known for their narrative style and their depiction of folk tales and religious themes.  Attributing them to Karnataka reflects a geographical inaccuracy.



**1. With reference to the coinage practices of the Satavahanas, consider the following statements:**

1. Satavahana coins predominantly used lead, with silver coins being a rarity.  They also utilized an alloy of silver and copper known as "potin".
2.  Satavahana coins typically featured an animal (elephant, horse, lion) or a Chaitya on one side and the Ujjain symbol on the other, inscribed in Prakrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the coinage practices of the Satavahana dynasty.  Statement 1 correctly identifies lead as the primary metal used, noting the scarcity of silver coins and the use of the "potin" alloy. This reflects the economic realities and available resources of the period. The mention of "potin" adds a layer of detail often overlooked, showcasing a nuanced understanding of ancient coinage materials. Statement 2 accurately describes the typical iconography found on Satavahana coins—the combination of animal or religious symbols (Chaitya) alongside the Ujjain symbol. The specification of Prakrit as the language used on these coins further enhances the historical accuracy.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially reflect the facts; option (d) is incorrect because both statements are demonstrably true based on historical evidence.  The question tests factual recall regarding a specific dynasty's coinage practices.


**2. With reference to the Gupta coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. Gupta gold coins frequently depicted the emperor engaged in martial activities such as hunting lions or tigers, or wielding weapons, while the reverse side often featured Goddess Lakshmi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a common feature of Gupta gold coinage. The depiction of emperors in both martial and peaceful activities, alongside prominent deities like Lakshmi, is well-documented. This demonstrates Gupta rulers' attempts to project both power and piety.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While gold was the dominant metal used in Gupta coinage, the Gupta emperors did also issue silver and copper coins, especially after Chandragupta II's reign.  The statement's claim of exclusive gold use is a significant oversimplification of the historical record. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between dominant trends and absolute claims in historical data.


**3. With reference to the coins of the Western Satraps, consider the following statements:**

2.  The reverse side of Western Satraps' coins exclusively displayed images of Buddhist Chaityas or stupas, reflecting a uniform religious policy across their reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Satraps' coins are indeed significant for their use of the Saka era dating system, starting from 78 AD.  The depiction of the king's head on one side was a common practice. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Buddhist Chaityas or stupas did appear on the reverse of some Western Satraps coins, it wasn't an exclusive feature. Their coinage showcased a variety of symbols and designs, indicating a more diverse religious landscape than the statement suggests.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 2. This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to evaluate the generalizability of historical observations.


**4. With reference to the coinage of the Chola and Pandya dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1. Early Pandya coins were square-shaped and featured an elephant, while later coins prominently displayed a fish symbol.  Their inscriptions were predominantly in Tamil on copper coins and Sanskrit on gold and silver coins.
2. Chola king Rajendra I's coins carried the legend "Gangaikonda Chola" and featured emblems of both a tiger and a fish, while Raja Raja I's coins depicted the king standing on one side and a seated goddess on the other, with inscriptions usually in Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Chola and Pandya coinage. Statement 1 correctly describes the evolution of Pandya coinage, from early elephant depictions to later fish symbols, and accurately notes the language used on different metal types.  Statement 2 correctly identifies key features of Raja Raja I and Rajendra I's coins, including legends, symbols, and inscription languages. The details provided in both statements, such as the change in Pandya iconography and the specific legends on Chola coins, demonstrate a detailed understanding of these dynasties' numismatic practices.  All other options are incorrect as both statements are factually accurate. This question assesses detailed factual recall and the ability to differentiate between the coinage of two closely related dynasties.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal coinage:**

2. Jahangir's coinage featured couplets as legends and, in some instances, included the name of his wife, Nur Jahan.  His coins also famously depicted zodiac signs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of Akbar and Jahangir's coinage. Statement 1 accurately details Akbar's Ilahi coins, their value, and their religious significance, reflecting Akbar's attempts to promote religious harmony (though ultimately unsuccessful).  Statement 2 correctly describes Jahangir's use of couplets and Nur Jahan's inclusion on some coins, demonstrating a personal touch and reflecting his personality. The inclusion of zodiac signs adds another layer of detail that distinguishes Jahangir's coinage. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements are accurate representations of historical facts.  The question tests knowledge of specific details in Mughal coinage and their historical context.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire primarily used gold for its coinage, with pagodas representing the higher denomination and featuring figures of running warriors with dagger symbols.  Silver taras and copper coins were also issued for fractional units and daily transactions, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Vijayanagara coinage system, highlighting the predominance of gold, the higher denomination pagodas with their characteristic iconography, and the use of silver and copper for smaller denominations. This reflects the economic strength and sophistication of the empire. Statement 2 is partially correct but contains an inaccuracy. While the early Vijayanagara coinage was indeed minted in various locations and had different names, the inscriptions were primarily in Kannada and Sanskrit, not Telugu and Sanskrit. The description of Krishna Deva Raya's varahan coin is accurate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the error in statement 2 concerning inscription languages.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Vijayanagara coinage and the ability to identify minor inaccuracies within a broader context of correct information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are supported by historical evidence. Statement 1 correctly points out the widespread use of cowrie shells as a form of currency in early India, particularly for smaller transactions.  This highlights the diverse forms of exchange that existed alongside metal coinage. Statement 2 correctly identifies the Vedic texts as the source of the earliest references to coins in India and correctly defines "Nishka". The mention of "Nishka" demonstrates a specific knowledge of early Indian terminology.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements are factually accurate. This question tests knowledge of early Indian economic practices and terminology.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the use of different metals in ancient Indian coinage:**

1.  The Kushan Empire's extensive use of coinage influenced numerous tribes and kingdoms to adopt their own coinage systems, often using similar metals and styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kushan Empire's coinage significantly impacted numismatic practices across various regions, leading to the widespread adoption of coin production by numerous entities. This reflects the Kushan Empire’s significant influence on the political and economic landscape of ancient India. Statement 2 is incorrect. Gold was used in Indian coinage much earlier than the Gupta period.  While the Gupta period saw a flourishing of gold coinage, evidence of gold coins exists from earlier periods, demonstrating the continuous use of gold as a material for currency throughout India's history. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2. This question tests the understanding of the evolution of coinage materials and styles in ancient India and the ability to identify broad trends versus specific claims.

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the use of specific symbols on coins of the respective dynasties. Statement 1 correctly identifies the peacock as a recurring symbol on Vardhana coins, particularly during Harshavardhana's reign. This reflects the cultural and symbolic importance of the peacock in that period. Statement 2 correctly notes the boar as a significant symbol on Chalukya coins, especially those of the Eastern Chalukyas, highlighting the dynasty's potential connection to the animal's symbolic meaning. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements correctly identify specific dynastic coin iconography. This question tests the knowledge of specific symbolic representations on ancient Indian coins and their potential significance.


**10. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate's coinage, consider the following statements:**

1. Iltutmish introduced the silver Tanka and copper Jital, establishing standardized currency units for the Sultanate.  The coins did not depict the Sultan's image due to Islamic prohibitions against idolatry.
2. Alauddin Khilji modified the existing coin designs by removing the name of the Caliph and replacing it with self-aggrandizing titles. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's experiment with token currency (bronze and copper coins) proved unsuccessful due to widespread forgery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Delhi Sultanate's coinage. Statement 1 correctly identifies Iltutmish's introduction of the Tanka and Jital, establishing standardized currency, and accurately notes the absence of the Sultan's image due to religious reasons. This highlights the Sultanate's efforts towards economic organization and adherence to religious norms.  Statement 2 correctly describes Alauddin Khilji's changes to coin designs and the failure of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's token currency experiment due to rampant forgery.  This reflects the challenges faced in implementing economic policies and the consequences of poorly conceived monetary reforms. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements are true and reflect accurate historical information. This question tests the knowledge of specific economic policies and their impact during the Delhi Sultanate.


**1. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate period architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khilji dynasty is known for its extensive use of red sandstone and the introduction of the arcuade style.
2. The Lodi dynasty is characterized by the construction of elaborate mosques with towering minarets and intricate ornamentation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilji dynasty, particularly under Alauddin Khilji, significantly employed red sandstone in their architectural projects. The Alai Darwaza stands as a prime example of this style.  They also introduced or significantly popularized the arcuade style, characterized by a series of arches, in their constructions, reflecting a blend of local and foreign architectural influences.  This represents a shift from earlier styles prevalent in the Delhi Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lodi dynasty, while building tombs, did not focus on elaborate mosques with towering minarets and intricate ornamentation.  Their architectural style was simpler and more austere compared to previous periods.  Their contributions were more in the development of double-dome architecture in tombs, aiming for structural strength rather than ornate decoration.  The emphasis on towering minarets and intricate detail is more associated with earlier dynasties like the Tughlaqs.  The Lodi period marked a relative decline in grand mosque construction compared to the preceding periods.

While they emphasized devotion, their approach was not characterized by extreme asceticism as much as the Nayanars, who were the Shaivite counterparts. The Alvars travelled widely, spreading Vaishnavism through their devotional songs, emphasizing bhakti (devotion) as the path to salvation.  They used vernacular languages to reach the common people.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nirguna school of Bhakti emphasized the formless, attributeless nature of God (Brahman), contrasting with the Saguna school which focused on God with specific forms and attributes.  This school rejected idol worship and traditional rituals, prioritizing knowledge and understanding of the divine through direct experience rather than through intermediaries or scriptures.  Prominent figures of this school include Kabir and Guru Nanak.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nicolo de Conti, in his account, described the Telugu language as the "Italian of the East" and praised the empire's advanced irrigation systems.
2.  Abdur Razzaq, a Persian chronicler, visited the Vijayanagara kingdom during the reign of Krishnadevaraya and provided a detailed account of its military strength.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nicolo de Conti, an Italian traveler, did indeed describe the Telugu language as the "Italian of the East," highlighting its perceived sophistication and fluency. His account also praised the empire's efficient and advanced irrigation systems, which contributed significantly to its agricultural prosperity and economic strength. He visited during the reign of Devaraya I.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Abdur Razzaq visited the Vijayanagara Empire, but during the reign of Devaraya II, not Krishnadevaraya. While he did provide a valuable account of the kingdom, his focus was more on the administration and courtly life rather than a detailed description of military strength.  His account offers insights into the political structure, trade, and social customs of the Vijayanagara kingdom during that time.


**4. With reference to the early foreign travelers to India, consider the following statements:**

1. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, described the caste system in his work Indica, highlighting its endogamy and hereditary occupations.
2. Fa-Hien, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, visited India during the reign of Chandragupta I and documented the prevalence of Buddhism throughout the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, did indeed provide a description of the Indian caste system in his work Indica, albeit with some inaccuracies and biases stemming from his Greek perspective. His account included observations on endogamy (marriage within the same caste) and hereditary occupations, reflecting the social structure of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fa-Hien visited India during the reign of Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya), not Chandragupta I.  Furthermore, while Fa-Hien documented the existence of Buddhism, he also noted that it was not uniformly prevalent throughout the whole of India; Buddhism was more prominent in certain regions than others.  His observations reveal a complex religious landscape with both Buddhism and Hinduism coexisting.


**5.  With reference to the Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The construction of the Agra Fort was primarily undertaken during the reign of Akbar, with subsequent additions by later Mughal emperors.
2.  The Fatehpur Sikri complex showcases a unique blend of Hindu and Persian architectural styles, exemplified by buildings like the Buland Darwaza and Salim Chishti's tomb.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Akbar initiated the construction of the Agra Fort, many of the structures within the fort complex were built or significantly modified by later Mughal emperors, especially Shah Jahan.  Akbar's contributions laid the foundation, but the fort's current appearance is a result of multiple phases of construction and expansion under different rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct. Fatehpur Sikri, a city built by Akbar, is indeed a remarkable example of the fusion of Hindu and Persian architectural styles.  The Buland Darwaza, a grand gateway, and Salim Chishti's tomb, known for its intricate marble jaali work, are prominent examples of this syncretic approach.  The architecture showcases Akbar's interest in incorporating various artistic influences into his building projects.


**6. With reference to the  Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three primary schools of Indian painting.
2. The Kailasa Temple at Ellora is an example of rock-cut architecture, renowned for its monolithic construction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are the three main styles of *temple architecture*, not painting.  These styles are distinguished by their characteristic features, such as the shikhara (tower) in Nagara style temples, the gopuram (tower) in Dravida style temples, and a blend of both in Vesara style temples.  Indian painting has its own distinct schools, such as the Rajput, Mughal, and Tanjore schools.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kailasa Temple at Ellora is a masterpiece of rock-cut architecture, famous for being carved out of a single rock. This monumental achievement demonstrates the advanced engineering and artistic skills of the artisans who created it.  It is an exceptional example of  Indian rock-cut architecture's technical prowess and artistic vision.


**7. With reference to the  Indian cultural heritage institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Archives of India (NAI) was established in 1891 in Delhi and primarily focuses on preserving and providing access to India's documentary heritage.
2. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) promotes Indian culture internationally through various programs, including grants for cultural events and exchanges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The National Archives of India (NAI) was initially established in 1891, but in Calcutta (now Kolkata), not Delhi. It was later shifted to Delhi in 1911. The NAI's primary role is indeed the preservation and provision of access to India's documentary heritage, encompassing a wide range of historical records.  The statement incorrectly places its founding in Delhi.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) plays a crucial role in promoting Indian culture globally. It achieves this through various programs, including grants and support for international cultural events, facilitating cultural exchanges, and fostering relationships with similar organizations worldwide.  The ICCR's activities contribute significantly to India's soft power and cultural diplomacy.


**8. With reference to the  Geographical Indications (GIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, came into effect in 2003 and provides legal protection for specific products linked to their geographical origin.
2.  As of April 2019, Karnataka had the highest number of GI-tagged products amongst all Indian states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, was indeed enacted to protect the intellectual property rights associated with products originating from specific geographical regions. This act came into force in 2003, providing a legal framework for GI registration and protection in India.  This legal protection safeguards the reputation and unique qualities associated with these products.

Statement 2 is also correct.  As of April 2019, Karnataka did indeed hold the distinction of having the largest number of GI-tagged products among all the Indian states. This reflects the diversity of agricultural and handicraft products originating from the state, and its proactive approach in securing GI protection for its unique products.  This highlights the economic and cultural significance of GIs for the state.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Wodeyar dynasty's coins, under King Kanthiraya Narasa, depicted the Narasimha avatar and weighed between six and eight grains.
2.  Haidar Ali initially continued the Wodeyar coinage tradition, featuring Shiva and Parvati on gold pagodas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Wodeyar and subsequent Mysore coinage.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the imagery and weight range of specific coins issued during the reign of King Kanthiraya Narasa of the Wodeyar dynasty. This detail showcases the specific iconography and weight standards employed in their coinage. Statement 2 accurately notes Haidar Ali's initial continuation of the Wodeyar coinage practices, including the use of Shiva and Parvati imagery on gold pagodas. This highlights the continuity in coinage styles despite a change in dynasty. The information reflects a nuanced understanding of the historical context and evolution of coinage in the Mysore region. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially reflect the accurate information provided in the statements. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually supported by historical evidence regarding the Mysore coinage.


**2. With reference to the Coinage Act of 2011, consider the following statements:**

1. It repealed the Coinage Act of 1906 entirely, introducing a completely new legal framework for coinage.
2.  The definition of "coin" under the 2011 Act explicitly includes commemorative coins and Government of India one-rupee notes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Coinage Act of 2011 did indeed replace the 1906 Act,  it's inaccurate to say it introduced a *completely* new framework.  Many aspects of coinage regulation likely continued with modifications.  Therefore, statement 1 is not entirely correct. However, statement 2 is accurate. The 2011 Act broadened the definition of "coin" to encompass commemorative coins and even one-rupee notes issued by the Government of India,  reflecting a more inclusive approach to legal definitions within the coinage system. This shows a deeper understanding of the legal nuances of the Coinage Act, 2011, particularly concerning the broadened definition of "coin." Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship between the 1906 and 2011 Coinage Acts and the precise definition of "coin" under the 2011 Act.


**3. With reference to early Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Satavahana dynasty primarily used lead for its coins, with silver coins being a rarity.
2.  The Ujjain symbol—a cross with four circles—was a common feature on Satavahana coins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of characteristics of Satavahana coinage. Statement 1 correctly highlights the prevalent use of lead as the primary metal for Satavahana coins, with silver coins being less frequent. This reflects the economic realities and metal availability during that period.  Statement 2 accurately points out the Ujjain symbol as a recurring feature on these coins. The inclusion of this specific symbol provides crucial information for identifying and understanding Satavahana numismatics.  The combination of both statements offers a complete picture of the material composition and symbolic elements of Satavahana coinage. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to accurately represent both the material composition and the symbolic features of Satavahana coinage.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gupta gold coins often depicted the king performing various activities, including religious rituals and warfare.
2.  The reverse side of Gupta gold coins frequently featured images of Goddess Lakshmi or other Hindu deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the iconography found on Gupta gold coins. Statement 1 correctly notes the depiction of the king engaging in a range of activities, from religious ceremonies to military actions.  This reflects the multifaceted nature of royal power and its religious and political dimensions. Statement 2 accurately identifies the frequent presence of Goddess Lakshmi and other Hindu deities on the reverse of these coins. This is significant because it reflects the religious beliefs and practices prevalent during the Gupta period. The combined statements provide a comprehensive overview of the visual representation and symbolic significance of Gupta coinage. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the range of iconography found on Gupta gold coins, which include both depictions of the king and Hindu deities.


**5. With reference to the coins of the Western Satraps, consider the following statements:**

1.  These coins frequently bore dates according to the Saka era, which commenced in 78 AD.
2.  The coins displayed only the head of the king on one side and a Buddhist chaitya or stupa on the other.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Western Satrap coins are known for their use of the Saka era dating system, starting from 78 AD.  This makes them important for chronological studies. However, statement 2 is an oversimplification. While many Western Satrap coins did feature the king's head, the reverse side wasn't exclusively limited to Buddhist chaityas or stupas. Other symbols and designs were also used, demonstrating a wider range of iconography.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the dating system used on the coins or incorrectly characterize the full range of iconography present on the reverse side.  The precision in identifying the Saka era dating system is crucial for understanding the historical context of these coins.


**6. With reference to the coins of the Chola and Pandya dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1. Early Pandya coins were square-shaped and often featured an elephant. Later, the fish became a prominent symbol.
2.  Chola coins under Raja Raja I typically depicted the standing king on one side and a seated goddess on the other, with inscriptions primarily in Tamil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the evolution of Pandya coinage, from early square coins with elephants to later coins featuring fish. This demonstrates an understanding of the chronological development of their numismatic styles. Statement 2, however, contains an inaccuracy. While Chola coins under Raja Raja I did often depict the king and a goddess, the inscriptions were predominantly in Sanskrit, not Tamil.  This subtle but important detail showcases the knowledge of the linguistic preferences in Chola inscriptions. Therefore, only statement 1 is fully correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the evolution of Pandya coinage or the linguistic details of Chola inscriptions.  The ability to distinguish between the predominant languages used in these inscriptions is essential for accurate historical interpretation.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Emperor Akbar issued gold coins called "Ilahi coins" to promote his new religious creed, Din-i-Illahi.
2.  Jahangir's coins often included couplets and sometimes bore the name of his wife, Noor Jahan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect aspects of Mughal coinage under Akbar and Jahangir. Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's issuance of Ilahi coins to promote his syncretic faith, Din-i-Illahi. This demonstrates an understanding of the political and religious context of Akbar's coinage policies.  Statement 2 correctly notes the inclusion of couplets and Noor Jahan's name on some of Jahangir's coins, reflecting the personal and artistic preferences of this Mughal emperor. This shows an understanding of the personalization of Mughal coinage.  The combined statements provide a well-rounded perspective on the evolution of Mughal coinage and its relationship with religious and political developments. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the coinage practices of both Akbar and Jahangir, highlighting the significance of both religious promotion and personal expression in Mughal numismatics.


**8. With reference to the use of cowrie shells in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cowrie shells served as a significant medium of exchange for small-scale transactions among the common people.
2. Cowrie shells held a fixed value in the market, similar to that of coins, but were mainly used in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the widespread use of cowrie shells as a medium of exchange for smaller transactions in ancient India, especially among the common populace. This highlights the importance of cowrie shells in the daily economic lives of ordinary people. Statement 2, however, is partially incorrect. While cowrie shells did possess a certain market value and were used in rural areas,  it's inaccurate to say they held a *fixed* value comparable to coins. Their value could fluctuate depending on various factors. The statement also incorrectly restricts their use to rural areas, omitting their use in urban centers for small transactions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the widespread use of cowrie shells or inaccurately depict the consistency of their market value and their restricted geographical use. The precise understanding of the role of cowrie shells in the ancient Indian economy is essential.


**9. With reference to pre-modern Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj issued gold coins called "huns" and copper coins called "Shivarais."
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire primarily issued copper coins for daily transactions, while gold pagodas were used for higher denominations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the coinage issued by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, encompassing both gold "huns" and copper "Shivarais."  This showcases an understanding of the specific terminology and types of coins used during his reign. Statement 2, however, is an oversimplification of Vijayanagara coinage. While the empire did use copper coins for daily transactions, gold coins (pagodas and others) were also extensively used, and not just for higher denominations.  Silver coins were also part of their monetary system. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the types of coins issued by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or inaccurately describe the full range of metals and denominations used in Vijayanagara coinage.  The knowledge of the specific coin names and the broader range of Vijayanagara coinage is crucial for accurate historical analysis.


**10. With reference to the early medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Varmana dynasty's silver coins featured the king's head on one side and a peacock on the other.
2. The Chalukyan coins often had a lion or temple image on one side, with the other side left blank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the coinage of the Varmana and Chalukya dynasties during the early medieval period in India.  Statement 1 correctly describes the typical design of Varmana silver coins, featuring the king's portrait and a peacock. The inclusion of the peacock adds a significant element for identifying these specific coins. Statement 2 accurately describes a common feature of Chalukya coins—the presence of a lion or temple image on one side, with the reverse side often left plain.  The description of the blank reverse side is crucial for identifying these coins. Together, these statements provide accurate insights into the distinct numismatic characteristics of these two dynasties. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to correctly describe the coinage of both the Varmana and Chalukya dynasties, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific iconography used on these coins.


**1. With reference to the Timurid dynasty and its impact on India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arrival of Babur marked the introduction of gunpowder technology in the Indian subcontinent.
2.  Timurid architectural influences, including the use of arches and domes, significantly shaped the region's building styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur's arrival, his invasion and the subsequent establishment of the Mughal Empire saw a significant advancement and widespread adoption of gunpowder weaponry, transforming warfare in the subcontinent.  The Timurids were skilled in its use, and their military success was greatly facilitated by their superior artillery and firearms.  This marks a turning point in Indian military history.

Statement 2 is also correct. Babur, a Timurid prince, brought with him Central Asian architectural styles, notably the extensive use of arches and domes. These became prominent features in Mughal architecture, influencing the design of mosques, tombs, and palaces.  The blend of Timurid and pre-existing Indian architectural traditions resulted in a unique Mughal architectural style that became a hallmark of the empire's power and cultural influence. The introduction and widespread use of arches and domes represent a significant shift in architectural aesthetics and techniques in India. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the impact of the Timurid dynasty on India.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its interaction with foreign travelers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abdur Razzaq, a Persian traveler, provided a detailed account of the reign of Devaraya II in his book *Matla-us-Sadain wa Majma-ul-Bahrain*.
2.  Nicolo De Conti, an Italian traveler, described the Telugu language as the "Italian of the East" during his visit to the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abdur Razzaq's account, though part of a larger work, offers valuable insights into the political, economic, and social conditions of the Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Devaraya II. His observations provide a crucial foreign perspective on the empire's administration, military strength, and cultural practices. The detail he provided is considered significant historical evidence.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Nicolo De Conti's comparison of the Telugu language to Italian reflects his perception of the language's sophistication and structure during his travels through the Vijayanagara Empire. While subjective, his observation highlights the cultural exchange and recognition of the Telugu language's prominence in the region.  His comparison, though a matter of opinion, illustrates the traveler's exposure to and appreciation of the regional language and culture.  Therefore, both statements accurately depict aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's interaction with foreign travelers.


**3. With reference to the development of Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kirana Gharana, a prominent Hindustani classical music tradition, significantly draws upon the musical influences from the border regions of Maharashtra and Karnataka.
2.  Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, a Bharat Ratna recipient, was a renowned exponent of the Agra Gharana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kirana Gharana, known for its distinctive style and melodic richness, indeed incorporates influences from the musical traditions of the regions bordering Maharashtra and Karnataka. This demonstrates the cross-pollination of musical ideas and styles across geographical boundaries in the development of Hindustani classical music.  The fusion of different regional styles is a key element in understanding the evolution of this art form.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Pandit Bhimsen Joshi was a renowned exponent of the Kirana Gharana, not the Agra Gharana.  His mastery of the Kirana style, characterized by its unique melodic approach and emotional depth, cemented his place as one of the most influential figures in Hindustani classical vocal music. The error in the statement highlights the importance of precise attribution in the context of Indian classical music traditions. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire and its patronage of arts, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's court included nine prominent figures known as the "Navratnas," who significantly contributed to various fields, including literature and music.  
2.  The *Akbarnama*, a detailed biography of Akbar, was written in Persian by Raja Todar Mal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reign was marked by a flourishing of the arts and intellectual pursuits. His court boasted nine eminent personalities, collectively known as the "Navratnas," who excelled in various disciplines. These included Abul Fazl (literature), Faizi (literature), Tansen (music), and others, contributing significantly to the cultural richness of the Mughal era. The Navratnas represent a crucial aspect of Akbar's patronage and its impact on cultural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Raja Todar Mal was a significant figure in Akbar's administration, known for his expertise in revenue management, the *Akbarnama* was authored by Abul Fazl, not Raja Todar Mal. This is a crucial detail in Mughal history and highlights the importance of accurate attribution in historical accounts.  The confusion between these two figures underscores the need for precise knowledge of historical details. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact on Indian culture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Alvars were a group of Vaishnava poet-saints who primarily composed in Sanskrit, praising Vishnu or his avatar Krishna.
2.  The Nayanmars were a group of Shaiva saints who contributed significantly to Tamil literature through their devotional poetry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Alvars were indeed Vaishnava poet-saints who praised Vishnu and Krishna, their compositions were primarily in Tamil, not Sanskrit. Their devotional poetry played a crucial role in shaping the Bhakti movement in South India, making it accessible to a wider audience.  The error in the statement highlights the importance of understanding the linguistic context of the Bhakti movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nayanmars were a group of 63 Shaiva saints who significantly contributed to Tamil literature through their devotional poetry. Their works, often imbued with intense emotional expression, are considered classics of Tamil literature and played a pivotal role in the development of the Bhakti movement in the region.  Their contribution to Tamil devotional literature is a key element in understanding the cultural and religious landscape of South India. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the development of Indian painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Thanjavur school of painting is primarily known for its use of gold coating in the paintings and received GI status from the Government of India for this technique.
2.  Raja Ravi Varma, considered the father of modern Indian art, hailed from Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Thanjavur school of painting is renowned for its distinctive style, characterized by the lavish use of gold in its artwork. This technique, a hallmark of the school, has indeed been recognized with GI status by the Government of India. The GI tag reflects the unique artistic heritage and craftsmanship associated with this painting tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Raja Ravi Varma, a pioneering figure in modern Indian art, was from Kerala, not Maharashtra. His contribution to the development of a distinctly Indian style of painting, bridging traditional and modern aesthetics, is significant in the history of Indian art. The error highlights the importance of correctly identifying the origins of influential artists. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to the early history of Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indo-Greek coins frequently featured inscriptions in both Sanskrit and Greek languages.
2.  Kanishka, a Kushana ruler, primarily issued gold coins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indo-Greek kingdom's coins often displayed bilingual inscriptions, reflecting the cultural fusion of the time. The use of both Sanskrit and Greek showcases the interaction between Indian and Hellenistic cultures. This bilingualism is a characteristic feature of Indo-Greek numismatics and provides valuable insights into the socio-cultural dynamics of the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kanishka's coinage was diverse, encompassing various metals, including gold, silver, copper, and lead.  While gold coins were certainly issued, it's inaccurate to state that they were his primary form of currency. The diversity of Kanishka's coinage reflects the economic realities and practices of his reign.  The error in the statement underscores the need for precise knowledge of historical details.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**8. With reference to the ancient Indian ports and their role in cultural exchange, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal, an Indus Valley Civilization port, primarily engaged in trade with Mesopotamia and Sumeria.
2.  Tamralipti, a major port during the Mauryan period, is mentioned in the writings of both Fa-Hien and Xuanzang.

Archaeological evidence points to extensive trade connections with Mesopotamia and Sumeria, showcasing the reach of the Indus civilization's commercial networks. The trade routes connected the Indus Valley with the wider world, contributing to cultural exchange.

Statement 2 is also correct. Tamralipti, a major port in ancient India, served as a crucial hub for maritime trade.  Its importance is well documented in the accounts of various travelers, including the Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien and Xuanzang, who visited and recorded their experiences. Their mentions provide crucial historical evidence of the port's significance in trade and cultural exchange.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the role of ancient Indian ports in shaping India's interaction with the outside world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism significantly diverged from earlier forms of Buddhism by emphasizing the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine figure worthy of worship.  The Bodhisattva path, where individuals delay their own Nirvana to aid others in achieving enlightenment, became central to Mahayana beliefs.  Crucially, image worship and elaborate rituals also became prominent features of Mahayana Buddhist practice, directly contradicting the assertion in statement 1.  The development of elaborate iconography and ritual practices was a key factor in the spread and popular appeal of Mahayana Buddhism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which focuses on individual enlightenment through monastic practices, Mahayana emphasizes the Bodhisattva path, where individuals strive for enlightenment not just for themselves but to guide others towards it.

2.  The Dravidian style exclusively uses granite as a building material, consistently across all regional variations and periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The towering gopuram is a defining feature of Dravidian temple architecture.  These massive gateway towers, often elaborately decorated with sculptures and intricate carvings, visually dominate the temple complex.  The gopuram's imposing presence is a distinctive element that sets Dravidian temples apart from Nagara style temples, which lack this prominent architectural feature.  The gopuram's size and ornamentation reflect the importance given to the temple entrance in Dravidian religious practice.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to remain in the cycle of samsara (rebirth) to guide sentient beings towards enlightenment.  This contrasts sharply with the Theravada emphasis on individual arhatship (enlightenment). The Bodhisattva path is a central feature distinguishing Mahayana from other Buddhist traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. Theravada Buddhism, often considered the "older" tradition, maintains a closer adherence to the original teachings of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali Canon.  It prioritizes individual practice and the attainment of Nirvana through monastic discipline and meditation, less focused on the Bodhisattva path and the deification of the Buddha seen in Mahayana.  The emphasis is on personal liberation rather than the salvation of all beings.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key differences between these two major branches of Buddhism.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's sophisticated irrigation systems, including tanks and canals, contributed significantly to agricultural prosperity.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reign witnessed a significant effort towards religious syncretism and tolerance. His promotion of the Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic faith, aimed to bridge the gap between different religious communities. However, this policy faced opposition from both Hindu and Muslim orthodox groups who were wary of religious innovations and compromises.  Akbar's efforts, while laudable in their intention, highlight the complexities of religious politics in a diverse empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan to commemorate his wife Mumtaz Mahal, is widely considered the epitome of Mughal architecture. Its design seamlessly integrates elements from various architectural traditions, including Persian, Indian, and Ottoman styles, creating a unique and breathtaking monument. The Taj Mahal's exquisite craftsmanship, use of white marble, and intricate inlay work demonstrate the height of Mughal artistic and architectural capabilities.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological evidence from sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveals a remarkably advanced urban planning system.  The cities were laid out in a grid pattern with well-planned streets, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, indicating a high level of engineering and architectural skill. This urban planning is considered a hallmark of the Harappan civilization and surpasses many contemporary civilizations in its sophistication.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the exact nature of the Harappan political structure remains debated, evidence suggests the existence of a centralized authority. The uniformity in weights, measures, and brick sizes across vast distances points towards a degree of centralized control and standardization.  Large-scale public works, such as the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro and the granaries at several sites, also imply the presence of a powerful authority capable of mobilizing resources and manpower for such projects.  The sophisticated planning and execution of these projects further support the idea of a centralized governing body. The absence of monumental palaces or temples, however, contrasts with many other ancient civilizations, suggesting a different form of centralized power compared to those that relied on overt displays of royal authority.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve liberation.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism completely rejects the concept of monasticism and emphasizes lay practice as the primary path to enlightenment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving Buddhahood, choose to remain in the world to guide and assist others on their path to enlightenment. This selfless dedication to the welfare of all sentient beings is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism and sets it apart from Theravada Buddhism, which emphasizes individual liberation. The Bodhisattva path represents a compassionate approach to achieving enlightenment, where the goal is not just individual liberation but the ultimate liberation of all beings.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Mahayana Buddhism does emphasize the importance of lay practitioners, it does not reject monasticism. Monasteries and monastic life continue to play a significant role in Mahayana traditions.  Monks and nuns serve as teachers, scholars, and custodians of Buddhist teachings and practices. The emphasis on lay practice simply reflects the Mahayana belief that enlightenment is attainable by anyone, regardless of their social status or lifestyle,  but monastic orders remain a vital part of the Mahayana Buddhist landscape.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's architecture is characterized by the construction of massive temple complexes, often incorporating Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions).
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's administration was entirely decentralized, with minimal central control over the various provinces.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire is renowned for its impressive temple architecture.  The temples are characterized by their grandeur, scale, and intricate detailing.  Many temple complexes included Kalyana Mandapas, which are large, elaborately decorated structures used for wedding ceremonies. These structures reflect the empire's wealth, artistic skill, and religious devotion.  Examples such as the Vittala Temple complex at Hampi showcase the distinctive architectural style of the Vijayanagara period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire's vast geographical extent and diverse population might suggest some degree of decentralization, the empire maintained a strong central administration.  The emperor held ultimate authority, and a hierarchical system of officials oversaw the governance of the various provinces.  While local rulers and chieftains held considerable influence within their regions, they were ultimately subordinate to the central authority.  The empire's efficient tax collection system and military organization underscore the strength of its central administration.  The existence of a well-defined administrative structure and a strong military indicates a centralized rather than a decentralized system of governance.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement emphasized a personal and emotional relationship with God, rejecting rigid ritualistic practices.
2.  The Bhakti movement exclusively focused on the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, neglecting other Hindu deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement was characterized by its emphasis on intense devotion (bhakti) to a personal God.  It challenged the rigid hierarchical structures and ritualistic practices of orthodox Brahmanical Hinduism, promoting a direct and emotional connection with the divine, irrespective of caste or social standing.  This emphasis on personal devotion allowed individuals from all walks of life to experience a direct relationship with God.  The movement's popularity stemmed from its accessibility and inclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many Bhakti saints were Vaishnavas, focusing on Vishnu and his avatars like Krishna and Rama, the movement was not limited to Vaishnavism.  It encompassed various sects and traditions within Hinduism.  Shaivite saints, for example, played a crucial role in the Bhakti movement in South India, emphasizing devotion to Shiva.  The movement's strength lay in its ability to transcend sectarian divisions and promote a common spiritual path based on love and devotion.  The diversity of deities and approaches within the Bhakti movement is a testament to its inclusive nature.


**5. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mughal painting initially drew inspiration from Persian styles but developed a unique style that incorporated Indian elements.
2.  Under Akbar's patronage, Mughal painting focused primarily on portraiture, neglecting other artistic genres.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mughal painting had its origins in Persian miniature painting, but it evolved into a distinct style under the patronage of Mughal emperors.  While initially adopting Persian techniques and aesthetics, Mughal artists gradually integrated Indian artistic traditions, resulting in a unique blend of Persian and Indian styles.  The incorporation of Indian elements, such as flora, fauna, and clothing styles, gave Mughal painting its distinct character.  The use of vibrant colours, detailed depictions of court life, and the inclusion of realistic portrayal of landscapes further distinguish Mughal art from its Persian antecedents.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Akbar's reign saw a significant flourishing of Mughal painting, it wasn't limited to portraiture.  Akbar's court commissioned a wide range of paintings, including depictions of historical events, scenes from literature (like the Hamza Nama), and illustrations of religious texts.  While portraiture became an important genre under Jahangir and later emperors, Akbar's patronage fostered a more diverse range of artistic subjects. The development of a distinctive Mughal style was a gradual process that spanned across several reigns and involved various artistic genres.

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed advanced knowledge of metallurgy, evidenced by the discovery of copper and bronze artifacts.
2.  The Indus script has been fully deciphered, revealing detailed information about the civilization's social and political structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indus Valley Civilization demonstrates a remarkable understanding of metallurgy.  Archaeological excavations have unearthed a variety of copper and bronze artifacts, including tools, weapons, and ornaments.

The presence of copper and bronze artifacts across various sites indicates a widespread and well-established metallurgical industry.  The quality and variety of these artifacts are a testament to the civilization's skill in working with metals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered.  Thousands of inscriptions have been found on seals, pottery, and other artifacts, but the language and meaning of the script remain a mystery.  Despite considerable efforts by scholars, no consensus has been reached on the decipherment of the script.  The lack of decipherment limits our understanding of the civilization's social, political, and religious beliefs.  The undeciphered script poses a significant challenge to our interpretation of the Indus Valley Civilization.


**7. With reference to ancient Indian astronomy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aryabhata accurately calculated the length of the solar year and proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system.
2.  The Surya Siddhanta is a significant astronomical text that incorporates elements of both Indian and Greek astronomical traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. Aryabhata made significant contributions to astronomy, including a remarkably accurate calculation of the length of the solar year.  However, he did not propose a heliocentric model of the solar system.  His model was geocentric, placing the Earth at the center of the universe, a common belief in ancient astronomy.  While his calculations were advanced for his time, attributing a heliocentric model to him would be inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Surya Siddhanta is a highly influential astronomical text of ancient India.  While it incorporates elements of Indian astronomical traditions, it also shows evidence of interaction with Hellenistic astronomy.  The text contains sophisticated mathematical models and calculations of planetary motions, reflecting a synthesis of different astronomical knowledge systems. The Surya Siddhanta's influence on later Indian astronomical works is considerable, highlighting its importance in the history of Indian science.


**8.  With reference to the  development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta cave paintings are primarily Buddhist in theme and demonstrate a synthesis of Indian and foreign artistic influences.
2. The Gandhara school of art, known for its Greco-Buddhist sculptures, flourished primarily during the Gupta Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta cave paintings are a remarkable example of ancient Indian art. The paintings are predominantly Buddhist in theme, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and the life of the Buddha. The style of the paintings shows a remarkable synthesis of Indian artistic traditions with influences from foreign cultures, particularly those along the trade routes connecting India to Central Asia and the West. The vibrant colors, flowing lines, and expressive figures are hallmarks of the Ajanta style.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhara school of art, known for its distinctive blend of Greco-Buddhist styles, flourished during the Kushan Empire, not the Gupta Empire. The Kushan period witnessed a significant interaction between Indian and Hellenistic artistic traditions. The Gandhara sculptures, particularly the Buddha images, reflect a combination of Indian iconography with Hellenistic artistic conventions.  The Gupta period, while also important for art, saw the development of a distinctly Indian style, different from the hybrid Greco-Buddhist style of Gandhara.


**9. With reference to  Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dhrupad style of Hindustani classical music is characterized by its emphasis on complex rhythmic patterns and improvisation.
2.  Carnatic music primarily utilizes the Tanpura as its main melodic instrument.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dhrupad is one of the oldest and most established styles of Hindustani classical vocal music.  It is characterized by its emphasis on complex rhythmic cycles (tala) and extensive melodic improvisation (aalaap, jor, jhala).  Dhrupad performances often feature intricate rhythmic variations and a focus on maintaining the purity and integrity of the raga.  The style's emphasis on vocal technique and mastery of complex rhythmic patterns sets it apart from other Hindustani vocal forms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Tanpura is used in both Hindustani and Carnatic music to provide a drone, it is not the primary melodic instrument in Carnatic music.  Carnatic music utilizes a variety of melodic instruments, including the Veena, Violin, Flute, and others.  The primary emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal performance, with instrumental music often accompanying and supporting the vocalist.  The use of various instruments reflects the diversity and richness of the Carnatic musical tradition.


**10. With reference to  ancient Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramayana and Mahabharata are two of the most important epics in Sanskrit literature, narrating stories with profound religious and philosophical significance.
2.  Kalidasa, a renowned Sanskrit poet and playwright, is primarily known for his works in Prakrit language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ramayana and Mahabharata are two of the most significant epics in Sanskrit literature.  These vast narratives are not only important works of literature but also serve as foundational texts for Hindu religious and philosophical thought.  The epics' influence on Indian culture, art, and society is immense, and they continue to inspire adaptations and interpretations to this day.  Their profound themes of dharma (righteousness), karma (action and consequence), and moksha (liberation) have captivated audiences for millennia.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kalidasa, one of the most celebrated poets and playwrights in Sanskrit literature, wrote his masterpieces in Sanskrit, not Prakrit.  His works, including the epics *Raghuvamsa* and *Kumarasambhava*, and the plays *Abhijnanashakuntalam*, *Vikramorvashiyam*, and *Malavikagnimitram*, are considered classics of Sanskrit literature.  His profound understanding of human emotions, his mastery of language, and his rich descriptions of nature have cemented his place as one of the greatest figures in Indian literary history.  The use of Sanskrit in his works reflects the importance of this language in the classical period of Indian literature.


**1. With reference to the coinage practices of the early medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the coinage practices of the Satavahana dynasty.  Lead was their dominant metal, silver was scarce, and their coin designs frequently included the motifs mentioned. The Ujjain symbol, a cross with four circles, was a common feature. This aligns with historical evidence from numerous excavated Satavahana coins.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Gupta coinage is renowned for its artistic merit and the depiction of the emperor in a variety of roles.  The inclusion of Goddess Lakshmi on the reverse side was frequent, reflecting the religious and cultural context of the Gupta period.  While other deities were also present, Lakshmi's prominence is well-documented.  The variety in the depiction of the emperor—from religious acts to martial prowess—demonstrates the multifaceted nature of imperial power during the Gupta era.  The use of Sanskrit inscriptions further solidified the Gupta coinage's cultural significance.


**2. With reference to the features of the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alvars, primarily Vaishnava saints, composed the *Nalariya Divya Prabandham*, a collection of poems praising Vishnu and his avatar Krishna, while the Nayanmars, devoted to Shiva, compiled the *Tevaram*. Both groups emphasized devotion as a path to salvation, rejecting the austerities of Buddhism and Jainism.

2.  The Virshaiva movement, founded by Basavanna, emphasized the worship of Shiva in the form of the linga, the wearing of the linga, the burial of the dead (instead of cremation), and challenged the caste system and traditional marriage practices.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the Alvars and Nayanmars within the Bhakti movement.  The *Nalariya Divya Prabandham* and *Tevaram* are indeed significant literary works associated with these groups. Their focus on devotion, rejection of ascetic practices, and use of vernacular languages to reach wider audiences are well-established aspects of their contribution to the movement.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the core tenets of the Virshaiva movement founded by Basavanna.  The emphasis on linga worship, the distinctive practice of wearing the linga, the burial of the dead, and the challenge to the rigid caste system and traditional marital norms are all accurate representations of this significant Shaivite sect.  Their rejection of Brahmanical orthodoxy and promotion of social reform within a religious framework were defining features.

Megasthenes' work, though fragmented, provided valuable insights into Mauryan India, including its geography and social structure.  His observations on caste and religious practices, while potentially influenced by his own perspective, offer significant historical data. Fa-Hien's account provides a firsthand perspective on the religious landscape of Gupta-era India, emphasizing the coexistence and relative popularity of Buddhism and Hinduism.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the contributions of Al-Biruni and Ibn Battuta. Al-Biruni's *Kitab-ul-Hind* is a seminal work showcasing his deep engagement with Indian culture and scholarship, providing detailed information across a wide range of topics.  Ibn Battuta's *Rihla* offers a rich tapestry of 14th-century Indian life, including vivid descriptions of cities, social customs, and administrative systems, providing valuable firsthand insights into the era.  His personal observations add a unique dimension to his account.

2. The Thanjavur school of painting, significantly patronized by the Marathas, is characterized by its use of gold coating and vibrant colors, depicting primarily Hindu deities and scenes from epics, resulting in a distinctive style that has been accorded GI status by the Government of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Varma's work is indeed considered pivotal in the development of modern Indian art, bridging traditional styles with Western artistic techniques. His influence on subsequent artists is widely acknowledged.  The painting mentioned is a well-known example of his work.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Thanjavur school of painting did receive patronage from the Marathas, its distinctive use of gold coating and vibrant colors is accurate.  However, the assertion that it has been awarded GI status for its gold coating is incorrect.  While the Thanjavur style itself might have GI status, it's not specifically for the gold coating technique.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the GI tag.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a remarkable understanding of urban planning, as evidenced by the grid pattern of roads in cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Evidence suggests that the Harappans possessed advanced metallurgical skills, capable of producing high-quality bronze objects, but lacked the knowledge of iron metallurgy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological excavations at major Harappan sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa have revealed a sophisticated urban planning system.  The cities were laid out in a grid pattern with well-planned streets, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, demonstrating a high level of engineering and architectural skill for their time. This urban planning is a hallmark of the Harappan civilization and a key aspect of its advanced societal structure.  The precise alignment of streets and the sophisticated drainage systems suggest a level of societal organization and planning rarely seen in other contemporary civilizations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the Harappan civilization is known for its mastery of bronze metallurgy, producing intricate tools, weapons, and ornaments, there's no substantial evidence of widespread iron use during their time.  The absence of iron tools in significant numbers, contrasted with the abundance of bronze artifacts, indicates that ironworking, if present at all, was not a dominant technology during the Harappan period.  This contrasts with later periods in Indian history where iron became a pivotal material. The development of iron metallurgy came later, significantly impacting subsequent civilizations.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own Nirvana to aid others in achieving enlightenment.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to help others achieve enlightenment. This selfless dedication to the welfare of all sentient beings is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism, setting it apart from earlier forms of Buddhism. The Bodhisattva path represents a compassionate approach to spiritual development, emphasizing collective liberation over individual salvation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While stupas are significant in Mahayana Buddhism, their origins predate the Mahayana school.  Stupas as sacred structures containing Buddhist relics, were already established during earlier periods of Buddhism, notably during the time of Ashoka.  The stupa's evolution continued through different Buddhist traditions, but its fundamental form and purpose were already established before the rise of Mahayana. The construction and veneration of stupas continued throughout the various Buddhist traditions, but their origins are not solely linked to Mahayana.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire is renowned for its impressive architectural achievements and artistic patronage.  The city of Hampi, the empire's capital, is a UNESCO World Heritage site, showcasing a remarkable collection of temples, palaces, and other structures. The Virupaksha Temple, a prominent example, demonstrates the empire's sophisticated architectural and artistic capabilities. The scale and grandeur of the structures at Hampi reflect the power and wealth of the Vijayanagara rulers, as well as their commitment to religious and artistic pursuits.  Many of these structures are still standing today, providing valuable insights into the empire's culture and artistic sophistication.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Talikota (1565) is widely considered a watershed moment in the history of the Vijayanagara Empire.  A combined force of Deccan sultanates inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara army, significantly weakening the empire and leading to its eventual disintegration.  Although the empire persisted for some time after Talikota, the battle marked a turning point, leading to a period of decline and ultimately the end of its dominance in South India. The battle's impact is significant because it marked a shift in power dynamics in the Deccan region.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's policy of Sulh-i-kul ("universal peace") was a cornerstone of his reign.  It represented a deliberate attempt to promote religious tolerance and harmony within his vast and diverse empire. This policy involved engaging with different religious communities, including Hindus, Jains, and Zoroastrians, through dialogues, discussions, and the implementation of policies that ensured religious freedom and equality.  Akbar's efforts to foster religious harmony were a significant departure from the religious policies of some earlier rulers and were instrumental in maintaining stability and unity within the Mughal Empire. His approach is still studied today as an example of religious tolerance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The construction of the Taj Mahal was initiated by Shah Jahan, not Jahangir, as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.  Shah Jahan's personal grief over his wife's death was a driving force behind the creation of this iconic monument, which is widely considered one of the greatest architectural marvels of the world.  The Taj Mahal stands as a testament to Shah Jahan's architectural vision and his profound personal loss.  The precise chronology and detailed planning of the Taj Mahal's construction are well-documented.


**5. With reference to Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of God, rejecting ritualistic practices and caste distinctions prevalent in both Hinduism and Islam.
2. Kabir was a direct disciple of Ramananda, a prominent Vaishnava saint, and his teachings were heavily influenced by the Bhakti movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kabir's philosophy stressed the unity of God, transcending the religious boundaries of Hinduism and Islam.  He critiqued the ritualistic aspects of both religions, emphasizing the importance of direct spiritual experience over outward displays of piety.  His rejection of caste distinctions was a radical stance for his time, advocating for social equality and challenging the rigid social hierarchy. Kabir's simple and direct language made his message accessible to people from all walks of life. His poems and teachings continue to inspire many today.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the exact details of Kabir's early life are debated, historical accounts suggest that he was influenced by the Bhakti movement and was indeed associated with Ramananda, a prominent Vaishnava saint.  Ramananda's teachings on bhakti (devotion) likely played a role in shaping Kabir's own spiritual development and his focus on the path of devotion.  Kabir's synthesis of Hindu and Islamic elements within a Bhakti framework is a testament to the movement's inclusivity.  However, some scholars also point to other influences on Kabir's thinking.

1. The GI tag protects the unique identity and reputation of products linked to a specific geographical region, preventing unauthorized use of the name.
2.  The GI tag applies only to agricultural products and does not extend to handicrafts or manufactured goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geographical Indication (GI) tag in India is a form of intellectual property protection. It is designed to safeguard the distinctiveness and reputation of goods that are associated with a particular geographical area.  The GI tag prevents others from using the same name or similar names, ensuring that only those producers from the designated region can legitimately use the name, thus protecting the quality, reputation, and market value of the product.  This protection is crucial for maintaining the authenticity and integrity of products linked to specific geographical locations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GI tag in India is not limited to agricultural products. It encompasses a wide range of goods, including agricultural products, handicrafts, and manufactured goods.  The scope of GI protection extends to any product whose unique characteristics are intrinsically linked to its geographical origin. This broader scope recognizes the importance of protecting the identity and reputation of various types of goods, not just those produced through agricultural processes. Many handicrafts and manufactured goods have received GI tags in India.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, is a crucial source for understanding the Mauryan Empire. Although his original work, Indica, is lost, fragments and references in later writings provide valuable information about the Mauryan administration, social structure, and economic activities.  Megasthenes' observations, while filtered through a Greek perspective, offer unique insights into the organization and functioning of a powerful ancient Indian empire. His account provides a glimpse into the daily life, customs, and beliefs of the people during that era.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ibn Battuta, a renowned Moroccan traveler, visited India during the 14th century.  His detailed account, Rihla, offers a rich description of various aspects of Indian society and culture during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.  Ibn Battuta's observations cover areas like the political system, social customs, religious practices, and daily life.  His account is particularly valuable because it offers a contemporary outsider's perspective on a specific period in Indian history, complementing other sources.  His descriptions of cities, markets, and interactions with people provide a vivid picture of 14th-century India.


**8. With reference to Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustani classical music tradition is characterized by the use of ragas (melodic frameworks) and talas (rhythmic cycles).
2.  Carnatic classical music, predominantly prevalent in South India, emphasizes kriti (compositional forms) and features a greater focus on improvisation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Hindustani classical music, primarily prevalent in North India, is structured around ragas (melodic modes) and talas (rhythmic cycles).  Ragas define the melodic framework, specifying the notes to be used and their characteristic melodic contours, while talas determine the rhythmic structure of the composition.  The interplay of raga and tala is a fundamental aspect of Hindustani classical music, providing a framework for improvisation and creative expression.   The vast repertoire of ragas and talas allows for immense diversity and complexity in Hindustani musical forms.

Statement 2 is also correct. Carnatic classical music, the classical music tradition of South India, is characterized by the use of kriti (compositional forms) as a central element.  Kriti are highly structured compositions that adhere to specific ragas and talas.  While improvisation is an essential part of Carnatic music, the kriti provides a foundation upon which improvisations are built.  The emphasis on kriti in Carnatic music, with its lyrical and melodic richness, distinguishes it from the Hindustani tradition.  The vocal and instrumental techniques are also distinct between the two traditions.



**9. With reference to  Indian cinema, consider the following statements:**

1.  The parallel cinema movement of the 1970s and 1980s focused on realistic portrayals of social issues and challenged the conventions of mainstream commercial cinema.
2. Satyajit Ray, a prominent figure in Indian cinema, is known for his contributions to both mainstream commercial cinema and the parallel cinema movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The parallel cinema movement in Indian cinema emerged as a reaction against the formulaic and often escapist nature of mainstream commercial films.  Parallel cinema filmmakers sought to create more realistic and socially relevant films, addressing issues such as poverty, social injustice, and political oppression.  These films often employed a more naturalistic style of filmmaking, with a focus on character development and social commentary.  The movement contributed significantly to the evolution of Indian cinema, expanding its thematic scope and artistic expression.

Statement 2 is also correct. Satyajit Ray, a highly acclaimed and influential filmmaker, is considered a master of Indian cinema. While he is best known for his humanist and realistic approach, his work transcended the rigid boundaries between mainstream and parallel cinema.  His films often combined artistic excellence with commercial success, showcasing a remarkable blend of artistic vision and audience appeal.  Ray's influence on Indian cinema and global filmmaking is profound and enduring, shaping the trajectory of Indian cinema.  His work continues to be studied and celebrated internationally.

The Sushruta Samhita, a comprehensive treatise on surgery, contains detailed descriptions of surgical instruments, procedures, and techniques.  This ancient text reveals a high level of understanding of anatomy, physiology, and surgical practices, far exceeding the medical knowledge of many contemporary civilizations.  The sophisticated knowledge exhibited in these texts underscores the advanced state of ancient Indian medical science.  Many surgical procedures described in the Sushruta Samhita were remarkably advanced for their time.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Haidar Ali's coinage featured Shiva and Parvati, continuing a tradition established by the Wodeyar dynasty.
2.  Tipu Sultan's coins uniquely incorporated two different eras.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the coinage practices of Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan.  Haidar Ali, after overthrowing the Wodeyar dynasty, continued their use of gold pagodas, albeit with depictions of Shiva and Parvati instead of the Narasimha avatar previously featured. This shows a pragmatic approach to maintaining established monetary systems while subtly incorporating his own religious preferences.  The use of two eras on Tipu Sultan's coins demonstrates a sophisticated and deliberate attempt to blend historical references and potentially legitimize his rule through multiple chronological frameworks, highlighting his ambition and self-awareness of historical context. The other options are incorrect because they fail to account for the verifiable historical evidence supporting both statements.  Statement 1 is not negated by any other aspect of the provided information, and statement 2 is a unique feature clearly stated in the source material.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian coinage, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Ujjain symbol, a cross with four circles, was a common feature on Western Satrap coins.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Satavahana kings primarily utilized lead for their coinage, with silver being uncommon. This reflects their economic realities and material availability.  The use of lead, while not aesthetically pleasing, served a practical purpose. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ujjain symbol is mentioned as a feature on Satavahana coins, the text links it specifically to *Satavahana* coins, not Western Satrap coins. The Western Satraps did borrow motifs from Satavahanas, but the Ujjain symbol's presence on their coins is not explicitly stated.  This distinction is crucial for accurate historical understanding.  The other options are incorrect as they either falsely include or exclude accurate information from the source.


**3. With reference to Gupta-era coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gupta gold coins often depicted the king performing ashvamedha sacrifices or engaging in other activities, while the reverse side featured Goddess Lakshmi.
2.  The Gupta dynasty's silver coinage commenced only after Chandragupta II's victory over the Western Satraps.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of Gupta coinage.  Statement 1 correctly notes the variety of depictions on Gupta gold coins, ranging from ritualistic activities to martial displays, reflecting the multifaceted nature of royal power and religious beliefs. The consistent presence of Goddess Lakshmi on the reverse highlights the importance of religious legitimacy in the Gupta imperial ideology. Statement 2 is also accurate, indicating the strategic timing of the introduction of silver coinage, linking it to a significant military victory that expanded Gupta control and resources. This suggests a connection between political expansion and economic policy. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical record provided in the text.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The coins of the Vardhana dynasty featured the king's head on one side and a peacock on the other.
2.  Harshavardhana's coins used a new era starting in 606 AD, coinciding with his coronation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly supports both statements.  Statement 1 accurately describes the iconography found on Vardhana silver coins, the king's image representing authority and the peacock potentially symbolizing royalty or a specific cultural significance.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the introduction of a new era on Harshavardhana's coins, linking the numismatic system to a key event in his reign. This suggests a deliberate attempt to establish a new historical reckoning under his rule.  This careful correlation of numismatic features with historical events is essential in understanding the political and social contexts of ancient Indian history.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to recognize the accuracy of both provided statements.


**5. With reference to the coinage of South Indian dynasties, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early Pandyan coins depicted elephants, while later coins prominently featured fish.
2.  Chola King Rajendra I's coins bore the legend "Gangaikonda Chola" along with tiger and fish emblems.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are supported by the provided text. Statement 1 accurately reflects the evolution of Pandyan coinage, showing a shift in iconography over time. The change from elephants to fish might reflect changes in religious beliefs, trade focus, or other cultural shifts. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of coinage as a reflection of societal change. Statement 2 correctly identifies the legend and emblems on Rajendra I's coins, providing specific details that can be verified against historical records. The inclusion of "Gangaikonda Chola" links the coinage directly to a significant achievement or location associated with the king's reign.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accurate information provided in both statements.


**6. With reference to Mughal coinage, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar introduced Ilahi coins in 1579 to promote his new religious creed, "Din-i-Illahi".
2.  Jahangir's coins frequently incorporated couplets and sometimes included the name of his wife, Noor Jahan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text directly supports both statements. Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's introduction of Ilahi coins and their purpose in promoting his syncretic religious ideology. This highlights the use of coinage as a tool for political and religious propaganda. Statement 2 correctly describes Jahangir's distinctive coinage, emphasizing the use of literary forms (couplets) and the inclusion of personal references (Noor Jahan). This reveals a more personalized and aesthetically driven approach to coinage compared to Akbar's overtly propagandistic approach.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to accurately reflect the information provided about Mughal coinage practices.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire primarily issued gold coins, with silver and copper coins serving as fractional units.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's gold varahan coin depicted a seated Vishnu on one side and a three-line legend in Sanskrit on the other.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text directly confirms the accuracy of both statements. Statement 1 accurately describes the Vijayanagara Empire's coinage system, highlighting the prevalence of gold coins and the use of other metals for smaller denominations.  This reflects the empire's economic strength and its sophisticated monetary system. Statement 2 correctly details the iconography and inscriptions found on a specific gold coin issued by Krishna Deva Raya, providing a specific example that supports the broader claim about Vijayanagara coinage.  The detail about the three-line legend in Sanskrit offers a verifiable point for historical verification. The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the evidence supporting both assertions.


**8. With reference to  the early Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cowrie shells served as a significant medium of exchange for small-scale transactions in early India.
2.  The term "Nishka" referred to coins made of various metals in ancient India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of aspects of the early Indian economy. Statement 1 correctly identifies cowrie shells as a widespread medium of exchange, particularly for smaller transactions among ordinary people. This illustrates the diversity of monetary systems employed in ancient India.  Statement 2 correctly defines "Nishka" as a term for coins made from different metals, demonstrating an early awareness and utilization of various metallic resources for currency. This shows a level of sophistication in the understanding and application of metallurgy for economic purposes.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to recognize the validity of both statements.  The information is explicitly given in the provided text.


**9. With reference to the evolution of Delhi as a city, consider the following statements:**

1.  Prithviraj Chauhan is credited with establishing the first city of Delhi, known as Qila Rai Pithora or Lalkot.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's capture of Delhi led to the establishment of Shergarh, later known as Purana Qila.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text directly supports both statements. Statement 1 accurately attributes the establishment of Qila Rai Pithora or Lalkot to Prithviraj Chauhan, although noting that he did not actually rule from Delhi.  This highlights the complex history of Delhi's development. Statement 2 correctly links Sher Shah Suri's conquest of Delhi with the creation of Shergarh (later Purana Qila), demonstrating the impact of military conquests on the city's physical and political landscape.  The renaming of the city further showcases the assertion of power by subsequent rulers.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to appreciate the information presented about the evolution of Delhi.



**10.  Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Taj Mahal's jaali work is characterized by its intricate, lace-like patterns.
2.  The Bibi-ka-Maqbara in Aurangabad is considered a superior imitation of the Taj Mahal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Taj Mahal's jaali work as lace-like and exceptionally fine, highlighting the architectural skill and aesthetic refinement. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes the Bibi-ka-Maqbara as a "poor imitation" of the Taj Mahal, directly contradicting the statement.  This contrast in descriptions underscores the differences in architectural ambition and execution between the two structures. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the information provided about these Mughal monuments, specifically failing to account for the contrasting descriptions given.


**1. With reference to the Timurid dynasty's impact on India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival introduced gunpowder warfare on a large scale in the Indian subcontinent, significantly altering military tactics and power dynamics.
2. The Timurids introduced the arch and dome architectural styles, which profoundly influenced subsequent Indian architecture, particularly during the Mughal era.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Babur's invasion marked a turning point in Indian military history.  While gunpowder weapons existed in India prior to his arrival, Babur's army's effective use of artillery and firearms, particularly in battles like Panipat, represented a significant escalation in gunpowder warfare's prevalence and impact. This led to a shift in military strategies and decisively altered the balance of power.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the use of arches and domes, heavily influenced Mughal architecture and, subsequently, other architectural styles in India.  The introduction of these elements is readily apparent in Mughal buildings, transforming the aesthetic landscape of the subcontinent.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  The assertion that both statements are accurate is thus justified.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding early Indian temple architecture:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar predates the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli and the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.
2. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves is stylistically consistent with the Gupta period's artistic conventions and is a prime example of Gupta sculpture.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lingaraja Temple, a magnificent example of Kalinga architecture, was constructed over several centuries, with its earliest phases dating back to the 11th century CE.  This predates both the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli (Mauryan period, 3rd century BCE) and the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram (Pallava period, 7th century CE).  Statement 1 is therefore accurate.

The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves is indeed a prime example of Gupta sculpture, reflecting the distinctive artistic style of the Gupta period (4th-6th centuries CE).  Its stylistic features, including the depiction of the Varaha avatar (boar incarnation) of Vishnu, align with the artistic canons and conventions of the era.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.


**3. With reference to significant places of pilgrimage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Srisailam is correctly matched with the Nallamala Hills, a location known for its rich biodiversity and ancient temples.
2. Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills, a range renowned for its scenic beauty and religious significance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Srisailam, a significant pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, is indeed located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  The Nallamala Hills are known for their rich biodiversity and the presence of numerous ancient temples and shrines.  This pairing is therefore correct.

However, Omkareshwar, a revered Jyotirlinga temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, not in the Satmala Hills. While the Satmala range holds religious significance, Omkareshwar's location is distinct.  This makes statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to Buddhist sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is situated in the Spiti Valley, a region known for its remote beauty and rich Buddhist heritage.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley, an area famous for its stunning landscapes and ancient monasteries.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Tabo Monastery, a significant Buddhist site, is correctly located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh.  The Spiti Valley is renowned for its high-altitude desert landscape and the presence of numerous ancient Buddhist monasteries and temples, reflecting a rich cultural heritage.  Statement 1 is therefore accurate.

The Alchi Temple Complex, however, is situated in Ladakh, not in the Zanskar Valley. While both Ladakh and Zanskar are regions in Jammu and Kashmir with significant Buddhist heritage, the Alchi temples are specifically located in Ladakh. This makes statement 2 incorrect.  Consequently, only statement 1 is correct.



**5. With reference to the concept of Panchayatan in Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Panchayatan refers to a style of temple construction characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, representing a specific spatial arrangement.
2. Panchayatan is exclusively associated with Hindu temple architecture and is not found in other religious traditions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Panchayatan is indeed a distinct architectural style in which a central shrine is surrounded by four smaller shrines, usually arranged symmetrically at the cardinal directions.  This arrangement is symbolic and holds religious significance. This description accurately reflects the concept. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

However, while Panchayatan is predominantly found in Hindu temple architecture, it's an oversimplification to claim it's exclusively associated with this tradition. Variations on the concept or similar spatial arrangements can be found in other architectural contexts, though perhaps not as prevalent or consistently defined.  This makes statement 2 incorrect.


**6. With reference to famous works of sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, depicted with celestial musicians and sorrowful followers, is found in the Ellora Caves.
2.  Arjuna's Penance, a monumental rock-cut relief depicting Arjuna's rigorous penance, is located at Mahabalipuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The monumental depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana (death and entry into Nirvana) with celestial beings and grieving disciples is a celebrated feature of Ajanta Caves, not Ellora Caves.  Ajanta's murals and sculptures are primarily Buddhist in theme.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Arjuna's Penance, a remarkable rock-cut relief showcasing Arjuna's intense penance, is indeed a prominent feature of the Mahabalipuram group of monuments in Tamil Nadu.  This monumental work is a prime example of Pallava sculpture.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana of Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily a mosque for the exclusive use of Akbar and his immediate family.
2. Akbar utilized the Ibadat Khana as a venue for theological discussions and debates with scholars from various religious backgrounds.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Ibadat Khana ("House of Worship") was located within the imperial complex of Fatehpur Sikri, it was not solely a mosque for Akbar's family. Its primary function was to serve as a space for religious discussions and debates, reflecting Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in engaging with diverse religious perspectives.  Statement 1 is incorrect.

Akbar actively used the Ibadat Khana to host meetings and discussions with scholars representing various faiths, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.  These discussions aimed to foster understanding and harmony between different religious communities.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar Caves, known for their remarkable preservation and association with the Ajivikas, predate the caves at Badami.
2. The Ellora Caves are renowned for their unique feature of housing cave temples dedicated to different religious traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Barabar Caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), are indeed among the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India. These caves were originally constructed for the Ajivikas, a contemporary religious sect.  Their construction predates the Badami caves (6th century CE).  Statement 1 is correct.

The Ellora Caves in Maharashtra are famous for their remarkable integration of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain cave temples within a single complex. This unique feature reflects the religious diversity and syncretism of the period.  Statement 2 is also correct.


**9. With reference to the characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Evidence suggests the Indus people worshipped both male and female deities, indicating a complex religious system with diverse iconography.
2.  Archaeological findings provide substantial evidence of horse-drawn chariots being used extensively in warfare by the Indus Valley Civilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization's religious practices are still being deciphered, but evidence from unearthed artifacts suggests a belief system that included both male and female deities.  The iconography is varied and complex, reflecting a rich symbolic world.  Statement 1 is correct.

While some animal remains suggestive of horses have been found in a few Indus sites, there is limited conclusive evidence to support the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare. The evidence for chariots, while debated among archaeologists, is far from definitive.  Statement 2 is incorrect.


**10. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chaityas were primarily places of worship, often featuring a stupa at the far end of the cave, while Viharas served as dwelling places for Buddhist monks.
2.  The distinction between Chaityas and Viharas is primarily based on the presence of a stupa; caves with stupas are classified as Chaityas, while those without are Viharas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Chaityas were indeed assembly halls or places of worship, often featuring a stupa at the far end. Viharas, on the other hand, served as residential quarters for monks.  This distinction is fundamental to understanding the function of these cave structures. Statement 1 is correct.

While the presence of a stupa is a significant indicator, it's not the sole criterion for distinguishing between Chaityas and Viharas. Other architectural features and contextual evidence also contribute to the classification.  Statement 2 is therefore an oversimplification.


**11. With reference to the three main styles of Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, is characterized by its curvilinear shikharas (towers) and intricate ornamentation.
2.  The Dravida style, common in South India, is distinguished by its pyramidal vimana (towers) and the presence of gopurams (gateways).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Nagara style of temple architecture, prevalent in North and Central India, is indeed known for its curvilinear shikharas (towers), which are often elaborately ornamented.  This style reflects a distinctive artistic and architectural sensibility.  Statement 1 is correct.

The Dravida style, dominant in South India, is characterized by its pyramidal vimana (towers) and the prominent presence of gopurams (gateways), creating a visually striking architectural ensemble. Statement 2 is also correct.  Both styles represent distinct regional variations within Indian temple architecture.


**12. With reference to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, consider the following statements:**

1. The Allahabad Pillar inscription primarily praises the achievements of Samudragupta, highlighting his military conquests and administrative prowess.
2. The inscription is written in Sanskrit and provides valuable insights into the political, social, and cultural aspects of the Gupta Empire.

The inscription details his military campaigns, administrative abilities, and cultural patronage.  Statement 1 is accurate.

The inscription is written in elegant Sanskrit prose and offers invaluable information about the Gupta Empire's political structure, social organization, and cultural achievements. It's a key source for understanding the era.  Statement 2 is also correct.


**13. With reference to the Angkor Wat temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Angkor Wat temple, initially a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, was later adapted for Buddhist use.
2. The temple's construction began during the reign of Suryavarman II, a significant ruler of the Khmer Empire.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Hoysala monuments are primarily located in Halebid and Belur in Karnataka, not in the Hampi and Hospet regions.  The Hampi region is associated with Vijayanagara architecture.  Statement 1 is incorrect.

The Lingaraja temple is not in Bijapur.  It is situated in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and is a significant example of Kalinga architecture.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.


**20. With reference to animals depicted in Harappan art and the Gandhara school of art, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While various animals were depicted in Harappan art, tigers are not among the most frequently found representations.  The statement is inaccurate in this regard. Statement 1 is incorrect.

The Gandhara school of art, which flourished under the patronage of the Kushan empire, did indeed frequently feature lions in its sculptures and reliefs, reflecting the syncretic nature of the art form.  Statement 2 is correct.  The Greco-Buddhist style often incorporated elements from Greek and Roman art.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The arrival of Babur in India directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology across the subcontinent, rendering previously dominant warfare tactics obsolete.
2. Babur's architectural preferences significantly influenced the subsequent development of Indo-Islamic architecture, resulting in a complete abandonment of pre-existing styles and the immediate adoption of the arch and dome.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur did introduce more sophisticated gunpowder weaponry, gunpowder technology already existed in India before his arrival. His military success was partly due to his effective use of this existing technology, but it didn't lead to an immediate and complete overhaul of warfare techniques.  The transition was gradual and depended on various factors beyond Babur's influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Babur's Timurid architectural background did influence Indian architecture, it wasn't a complete replacement of pre-existing styles.  The evolution of Indo-Islamic architecture was a blend of existing Indian traditions and the influences of various Central Asian and Middle Eastern styles, a process that extended over centuries. The arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before Babur's arrival. His contribution was more of an integration and refinement of existing architectural elements rather than a radical shift.  The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process.


**2. With reference to the art and archaeological history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, a masterpiece of Kalinga architecture, predates the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, reflecting a shift from rock-cut architecture to structural temple architecture.
2. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, showcasing the boar incarnation of Vishnu, exemplifies the artistic excellence of the Gupta period, surpassing the sophistication of the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple.  The Dhauli elephant is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), while the Lingaraja Temple dates to a much later period (11th-13th century CE).  The statement incorrectly suggests a chronological reversal.  The chronological order reflects a continuity and evolution of artistic styles rather than a complete shift from one form to another.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both the Varaha image at Udayagiri and the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram represent high points of their respective artistic periods (Gupta and Pallava).  Attributing superiority to one over the other is subjective and depends on different aesthetic criteria.  The artistic styles and techniques differ significantly due to different historical contexts.  It's an oversimplification to declare one as superior to the other.


**3. With reference to pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Srisailam, a significant pilgrimage site known for its temple dedicated to Shiva and Parvati, is situated amidst the Satmala Hills, reflecting the sacred geographical context of many Hindu pilgrimage sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Srisailam is located in the Nallamala Hills, not the Satmala Hills.  The statement incorrectly associates the pilgrimage site with the wrong mountain range, demonstrating a lack of precise geographical knowledge.  The geographical context of pilgrimage sites is important for understanding their historical and cultural significance.

Statement 2 is correct. Omkareshwar is situated on an island in the Narmada River, in the Vindhya Range, not the Satmala Hills. The statement correctly identifies the mismatch between the pilgrimage site and the mountain range mentioned, emphasizing the importance of accurate geographical information.  The error in Statement 1 highlights the need for careful verification of geographical details related to pilgrimage sites.


**4. With reference to Buddhist history, tradition and culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex, a significant example of Himalayan Buddhist art and architecture, is located in the Zanskar Valley, showcasing the spread of Buddhism across various regions of the Himalayas.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex, renowned for its unique blend of Kashmiri and Tibetan artistic styles, is situated in the Spiti Valley, reflecting the cultural exchange and artistic influences along ancient trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Spiti Valley, not the Zanskar Valley. The statement misplaces the significant Buddhist site geographically, demonstrating the importance of accurate location information in understanding the spread of Buddhism and its related cultural expressions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Alchi Temple Complex is located in Ladakh, not the Spiti Valley. The statement again misplaces the location of a significant Buddhist site, showing the need for precise geographical knowledge in understanding the cultural exchange and artistic influences along trade routes. The incorrect geographical details in both statements highlight the need for accurate information in historical and cultural studies.


**5. With reference to the cultural history of India, consider the following statements:**

2.  Panchayatan style is uniquely associated with the Nagara style of temple architecture, excluding its presence in other architectural styles prevalent in different regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan refers to a specific style of temple construction featuring a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, often representing a central deity and four associated deities or directional guardians. This arrangement held symbolic significance in various religious and cosmological contexts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Panchayatan is commonly associated with Nagara-style temples, it is not exclusively limited to this style.  Variations of this architectural plan can be found in temples belonging to other architectural styles across different regions of India, reflecting the adaptability and regional variations in temple design. The statement wrongly limits the application of Panchayatan to a single architectural style.


**6. With reference to Indian art and sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana at Ajanta, featuring celestial musicians and sorrowful followers, represents a unique iconographic representation found only in Ajanta cave paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ajanta depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is a significant example, similar iconographic representations can be found in other Buddhist art across different regions and periods.  The statement incorrectly suggests a unique and exclusive representation to Ajanta.  The iconography of the Mahaparinirvana evolved over time, influenced by various regional and cultural factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Arjuna's penance at Mamallapuram is a remarkable example of rock-cut sculpture,  there are other rock-cut sculptures across India that are comparable in scale and artistic merit, depending on the criteria used for evaluation. The statement overstates the uniqueness of Mamallapuram's sculpture in terms of both scale and artistic merit. The statement shows a lack of awareness of the broader context of Indian rock-cut sculpture.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana primarily served as Akbar's private chamber for prayer, reflecting his personal devotion and adherence to Islamic practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ibadat Khana was used for prayer, its primary function was as a venue for religious discussions and debates involving scholars from various faiths. This reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in different religious perspectives, not a focus solely on his personal Islamic practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana was not exclusively used for discussions among high-ranking Muslim officials. Akbar invited scholars and theologians from diverse religious backgrounds, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity, to participate in these discussions.  The statement misrepresents the inclusive nature of Akbar's religious policy and the purpose of the Ibadat Khana.  The statement's inaccuracy highlights the importance of understanding Akbar's religious policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Barabar caves were originally built for Ajivikas, not Buddhist monks.  The statement wrongly attributes the caves to Buddhism, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the religious context of early rock-cut architecture. Ajivikas were a distinct religious sect in ancient India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Badami caves are indeed renowned for their intricate carvings and murals, and they were constructed during the early medieval period by the Chalukya dynasty. The statement accurately reflects the historical context and artistic significance of the caves.  The contrast between the correct and incorrect statements in this question highlights the importance of accurate religious and dynastic attributions in history.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, though not entirely exclusive.  Ajanta caves are primarily known for their Buddhist murals depicting Jataka tales and other Buddhist themes, and these murals are often associated with the Gupta period.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed advanced urban planning and sophisticated engineering, there's limited evidence of grand palaces and temples as found in later periods.  The structures discovered are more likely to have served civic or administrative purposes. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of the Indus urban landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization suggests worship of both male and female deities.  While the exact nature of their religious beliefs remains debated, depictions of various figures, including what are interpreted as mother goddesses, indicate a more complex religious system than solely focused on male deities. The statement simplifies a complex and incompletely understood aspect of the civilization.  The incorrectness of both statements highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the Indus Civilization.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the distinction between Chaityas and Viharas is essential for studying Buddhist monastic life and religious practices.

Statement 2 is correct. Chaityas were indeed places of worship, typically containing a stupa at the far end and a hall axial to it. This architectural arrangement provided a specific space for religious rituals and ceremonies.  The statement accurately describes the layout and function of Chaityas.  The contrast between the correct and incorrect statements emphasizes the importance of understanding the terminology and functions of architectural elements.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hoysala monuments are primarily found in Halebid and Belur, not Hampi and Hospet. The statement misplaces the location of significant monuments, demonstrating the importance of accurate geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysaleswara Temple is dedicated to Shiva, not Vishnu. The statement misidentifies the deity associated with a significant temple, demonstrating the need for accurate religious information. The incorrectness of both statements highlights the need for precise information in historical and cultural studies.

The statement makes an inaccurate claim about the representation of animals in Harappan art. The contrast between the statements highlights the importance of accurate observation and interpretation of archaeological evidence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Phad painting is primarily associated with Rajasthan, not Karnataka.  The statement again misattributes the geographical origin of a painting style, further emphasizing the need for precise regional information.

**1. With reference to the life and works of Kalidasa, consider the following statements:**

1. Kalidasa's plays, *Malavikagnimitra*, *Abhijnanashakuntalam*, and *Vikramorvasiyam*, achieved immense popularity, solidifying his legendary status in Sanskrit literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  *Malavikagnimitra*, *Abhijnanashakuntalam*, and *Vikramorvasiyam* are indeed three of Kalidasa's most famous plays, which contributed significantly to his enduring fame as a master of Sanskrit drama.  Their enduring popularity is a testament to his skill in crafting compelling narratives and rich characters.  These plays are studied and appreciated even today for their literary merit and lasting impact on Sanskrit theatre.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kalidasa is renowned for his plays, he also made significant contributions to epic poetry and other poetic forms.  His epic poems, *Raghuvamsa* and *Kumarasambhava*, are considered masterpieces of Sanskrit literature, showcasing his mastery of narrative and descriptive poetry.  Furthermore, *Ritusamhara* (The Seasons) and *Meghaduta* (The Cloud Messenger) demonstrate his skill in lyrical and descriptive poetry, expanding his literary repertoire beyond just dramatic works.  His work encompasses a wide range of poetic styles and subjects, making him a versatile and influential figure in Sanskrit literature.


**2. With reference to the reign of Shashanka, consider the following statements:**

1. Shashanka, the first king of ancient Bengal, ruled the Gauda Kingdom from approximately 600 to 625 CE, a period marked by significant political influence and the issuance of gold and silver coins.
2. Shashanka's reign was characterized by his staunch support for Buddhism, evident in his patronage of Buddhist monasteries and the construction of numerous stupas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Historical accounts place Shashanka's reign in the Gauda Kingdom during the specified period. His political influence is well-documented, and the discovery of his gold and silver coins confirms his control over resources and economic power.  The mention of his coinage further underscores his administrative capabilities and the extent of his authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shashanka is known for his strong Hindu leanings and active persecution of Buddhism.  He is historically linked to the destruction of Buddhist stupas in Bengal and the cutting down of the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, actions that stand in stark contrast to the image of a Buddhist patron.  This historical fact highlights a significant aspect of his reign, illustrating the religious tensions and conflicts of the era and his role in shaping the religious landscape of ancient Bengal.


**3. With reference to Harshavardhana's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Harshavardhana's empire extended across a vast area of North India, encompassing numerous regions and establishing Kannauj as its prominent capital.  His administration was characterized by a highly centralized system with direct royal control over all aspects of governance.
2. Xuanzang, a Chinese traveler who visited Harsha's court, provided detailed accounts of the kingdom's administration, social structures, and religious practices in his writings. However, Xuanzang's accounts present a completely unbiased and objective portrayal of Harsha's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Harshavardhana's empire was vast and Kannauj was a major capital, his administration wasn't entirely centralized.  The text mentions the promotion of a feudal system under his reign, where officials were granted land (feudatories) in exchange for taxes, indicating a degree of decentralization of power.  The direct control of the king was reduced by this system, contradicting the claim of complete centralization.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Xuanzang's writings do indeed offer valuable insights into Harshavardhana's kingdom. However, to state that his account is entirely unbiased is inaccurate. As a devout Buddhist monk, Xuanzang's perspective would naturally be influenced by his religious beliefs, potentially leading to a more positive portrayal of Harsha's patronage of Mahayana Buddhism and a less critical view of other aspects of his reign.  His account, while informative, should be considered within the context of its author's biases and the limitations of a single source.


**4. With reference to Dharma Pala's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Dharma Pala, the second Pala ruler of Bengal, reigned from 770 to 810 CE, a period marked by significant achievements in the revival of Nalanda University and the founding of Vikramshila University.
2.  Dharma Pala's reign saw the construction of several important Buddhist monasteries, including the great Vihara at Somapuri in Verendri, but he did not play a role in establishing the Odantapuri monastery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Dharma Pala is credited with the revival of Nalanda and the founding of Vikramshila, the provided dates (770-810 CE) are disputed.  The text itself mentions conflicting dates for his reign (770-810 AD and 783-820 AD), highlighting the uncertainties in historical accounts.  The accuracy of the specific dates remains debatable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Dharma Pala is *credited* with building the monastery at Odantapuri, although other accounts attribute its construction to magical means and subsequent entrustment to Devapala. The ambiguity surrounding the construction of Odantapuri indicates that attributing it solely to Dharma Pala or Devapala is a simplification of a complex historical narrative, making a definitive statement incorrect.


**5. With reference to Gorakhnath and his legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Gorakhnath, a Nath Yogi associated with Shaivism, was a prominent disciple of Matsyendranath and is believed to have lived in the early 11th century. His followers, known as Yogis, Gorakhnathis, Darshani, or Kanphatas, primarily resided in the Indian Himalayan plains and Nepal.
2. Gorakhnath's teachings emphasized the pursuit of truth and spiritual life, rejecting worldly pursuits and advocating for a life of strict asceticism, devoid of any involvement in social or political movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The information about Gorakhnath's lineage, approximate timeframe, and the geographical distribution of his followers accurately reflects historical accounts.  The details provided are consistent with established knowledge about Nath Yogis and their traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gorakhnath's teachings emphasized spiritual growth, it is inaccurate to claim that his followers completely rejected worldly involvement or social and political action. The text clearly states that from the 14th century onward, his followers participated in a warrior-ascetic movement to resist oppression from Islamic and British rule, demonstrating their active engagement in socio-political spheres.  This contradicts the assertion of complete disengagement from worldly affairs.


**6. With reference to Amir Khusrau's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), a renowned Sufi musician, poet, and scholar, was a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi. His musical compositions are still sung in various dargahs across India.
2. Amir Khusrau's contributions were limited to the field of poetry; he did not make any significant contributions to Indian classical music or the invention of musical instruments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided information about Amir Khusrau's life, affiliations, and artistic contributions is accurate. His status as a significant figure in Sufi music and poetry is well-established, and the continued performance of his songs in dargahs is a testament to his lasting influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Amir Khusrau's influence extended significantly beyond poetry.  The text explicitly credits him with enriching Indian classical music by introducing Persian and Arabic elements and originating the *khyal* and *tarana* styles of music. He is also credited with the invention of the sitar, a claim that, while debated, highlights his importance in the evolution of Indian musical instruments. His contributions were multi-faceted, encompassing music, poetry, and scholarship.


**7. With reference to Marco Polo's travels and writings, consider the following statements:**

1. Marco Polo (1254-1324), an Italian traveler, visited the Pandyan kingdom in South India and provided detailed accounts of its wealth, culture, and practices in his book, *The Travels of Marco Polo*.  His account is renowned for its objectivity and lack of bias.
2.  Marco Polo's writings primarily focused on his experiences in China and did not offer significant details about his travels within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Marco Polo did indeed visit the Pandyan kingdom and his *Travels* mentions the kingdom's wealth and the Pandyan king's lavish lifestyle. However, to claim his account is entirely objective and unbiased is an oversimplification. Like any historical account, his writings are subject to the limitations of his perspective, potential biases, and the passage of time. While valuable, his account requires critical analysis and should be cross-referenced with other historical sources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Marco Polo visited the Kakatiya kingdom and included details in his writings, demonstrating that his account does include significant information about his travels in India.  His journey through Asia, lasting 24 years, included significant time spent in various parts of India, which he documented in his writings.


**8. With reference to Rudrama Devi, consider the following statements:**

1. Rudrama Devi, the youngest ruler of the Kakatiya dynasty, reigned from 1263 until her death.  She is notable for being one of the few women to rule as a monarch in India, successfully maintaining the integrity of her empire despite numerous challenges.
2.  Rudrama Devi's reign was characterized by her reliance on aristocratic warriors and her adherence to traditional methods of governance, resisting any significant changes or reforms in the administration or military structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The information about Rudrama Devi's reign, her status as a female monarch, and the challenges she faced accurately reflects historical accounts. Her successful rule is noteworthy in the context of the historical limitations placed on women in positions of power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifically mentions that Rudrama Devi recruited warriors from non-aristocratic backgrounds, granting them land rights in exchange for their support. This indicates a departure from traditional methods of governance and a strategic shift in military recruitment, contradicting the claim of adherence to traditional structures.


**9. With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's policies were widely praised by his contemporaries for their effectiveness and positive impact on the Mughal empire's economic prosperity and social stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign accurately reflects historical accounts. His attempts at introducing token currency and relocating the capital, while ambitious, are well-documented as failures that had negative consequences.  These policies highlight his bold, albeit often misguided, attempts at economic and administrative reform.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text describes Muhammad bin Tughlaq's policies as having failed, and that he was harsh with his enemies, resulting in gruesome deaths. This is in direct contrast to the statement claiming his policies were praised for their positive impact.  The historical record depicts his reign as a period of turmoil and economic hardship, not prosperity and stability.


**10. With reference to Narsinh Mehta, consider the following statements:**

1. Narsinh Mehta (1414-1481), a saint-poet of Gujarat, excelled in Vaishnava poetry and made significant contributions to Gujarati literature, earning the title "Adi Kavi" (first poet).  His bhajan, "Vaishnav Jana To," is widely known and holds religious significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The information about Narsinh Mehta's contributions to Gujarati literature, his title, and the popularity of his bhajan "Vaishnav Jana To" are all accurate.  His work is a cornerstone of Gujarati devotional poetry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Narsinh Mehta was born into a poor family and faced hardships in his early life, including the loss of his parents and being raised by his grandmother.  This contradicts the claim of a wealthy upbringing.  His life story highlights the contrast between humble origins and significant literary achievement.


**11. With reference to Mahmud Begada, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Begada (1458-1511), the most famous sultan of Gujarat, ruled for over fifty years and established Ahmedabad and Champaner as his capitals. His reign is associated with the prosperity of Gujarat and significant contributions to its culture.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The information regarding Mahmud Begada's reign, his capitals, and the prosperity of Gujarat under his rule is accurate and well-documented. His long reign and contributions to Gujarati culture are significant aspects of his legacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes Mahmud Begada as having a love for justice and wise measures, which are characteristics inconsistent with religious intolerance and persecution.  The description of his reign emphasizes his positive contributions to the welfare of his people and the development of Gujarat, contradicting the assertion of religious intolerance.


**12. With reference to Eknath, consider the following statements:**

1. Eknath, a prominent Marathi saint, scholar, and religious poet of the Varkari Sampradaya, was born in 1533 CE. His lineage connects him to Shri Bhanudas, a major figure in the Vitthala sect at Pandharpur.
2. Eknath's literary works primarily focused on secular themes, with minimal engagement with religious or spiritual matters.  He is not known for any significant contributions to religious poetry or commentary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that Eknath wrote *Bhavartha Ramayana*, numerous *Abhangas*, and *Bharudas*, which are forms of religious poetry and commentary.  His major work, *Eknath Bhagavata*, is a Marathi commentary on the Bhagavata Purana, demonstrating his significant contributions to religious literature.  His emphasis on *kirtana*, *nama smarana*, and *dhyana* further confirms his focus on religious and spiritual matters.


**13. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar, the third Mughal emperor, embraced secularism and introduced "Din-i-Illahi," a religious path aimed at promoting peace, unity, and tolerance within his empire.  Din-i-Illahi was characterized by a rigid set of religious doctrines and strict adherence to specific rituals.
2.  Akbar's court included prominent figures known as the "Nine Navaratnas," who represented diverse backgrounds and expertise, contributing significantly to the intellectual and cultural flourishing of his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Akbar did promote religious tolerance and introduced Din-i-Illahi, to describe it as having "rigid doctrines and strict rituals" is inaccurate. The text explicitly states that Din-i-Illahi lacked holy books or temples, emphasizing its syncretic nature and focus on monotheism and non-violence.  The description of Din-i-Illahi in the text contradicts the claim of rigidity.

Statement 2 is correct. The existence of the "Nine Navaratnas" and their diverse backgrounds are well-documented aspects of Akbar's court.  These individuals played important roles in various fields, reflecting the intellectual and cultural richness of his reign.  Their presence exemplifies Akbar's patronage of talent and his commitment to fostering a diverse and vibrant court.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text highlights Ahilyabai Holkar's wise spending of government funds on various projects, including the construction of forts, rest houses, wells, and roads, as well as donations to Hindu temples and the celebration of festivals.  This demonstrates her concern for social welfare and infrastructure development, directly contradicting the statement that she neglected these aspects.  Her actions show a balanced approach to governance, combining military strength with social and religious patronage.


**15. With reference to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, consider the following statements:**

1. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836-1886), a 19th-century Indian yogi from Bengal, was deeply influenced by various religious traditions, including devotion to Kali, Tantra, Vaishnava Bhakti, and Advaita Vedanta. He served as the chief priest at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple.
2. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's teachings and influence remained largely confined to his immediate circle; he did not have any significant impact on the development of religious movements or institutions in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 1 is correct. The description of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's life, his religious influences, and his role at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple accurately reflects historical accounts.  His syncretic approach to spirituality and his deep devotion are well-known aspects of his life.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's influence led to the formation of the Ramakrishna Mission by his chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda.  The establishment of this significant religious and social organization directly contradicts the claim that his impact was limited.  The Ramakrishna Mission continues to be a major influence in India and globally, demonstrating the far-reaching consequences of his teachings.



**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known Harappan site is located in present-day Gujarat, known for its advanced dockyard.
2.  The Harappans used standardized burnt mud bricks for construction, and their cities featured a grid pattern of roads.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lothal in Gujarat was a significant Harappan site with a dockyard, Rakhigarhi in Haryana is considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Lothal's importance lies in its evidence of maritime trade and sophisticated urban planning, but its size is not the largest compared to Rakhigarhi.  The statement confuses the importance of Lothal's dockyard with its overall size.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Harappan Civilization is renowned for its standardized burnt mud bricks used in construction, and the grid pattern of roads in major cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa demonstrates advanced urban planning. This uniformity in brick size and the orthogonal street layout indicate a sophisticated level of engineering and societal organization.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the concept of Bodhisattvas, who delay their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  Image worship and rituals were strictly prohibited in Mahayana Buddhism, adhering to the original teachings of the Buddha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to guide others towards enlightenment. This compassionate act of self-sacrifice is central to Mahayana philosophy and its emphasis on universal salvation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism's emphasis on personal meditation and the avoidance of idol worship, Mahayana Buddhism incorporated image worship and elaborate rituals as means to connect with the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.  These practices were seen as aids to spiritual development and achieving enlightenment.  The statement incorrectly portrays Mahayana Buddhism as rejecting these practices.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana Mandapas, elaborate wedding pavilions, were a distinctive feature of Chalukya temple architecture, influencing later styles.
2.  The Vijayanagara kingdom's temple construction is notably characterized by the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) are indeed a significant architectural feature, they are most prominently associated with the Vijayanagara Empire's temple architecture, not the Chalukyas.  The statement incorrectly attributes this architectural element to the Chalukyas.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vijayanagara Empire is known for its magnificent temples, many of which incorporate Kalyana Mandapas as a prominent feature. These structures reflect the empire's wealth, artistic skill, and religious devotion. The statement accurately reflects a key characteristic of Vijayanagara temple architecture.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Saint Nimbarka, a contemporary of Akbar, significantly contributed to the Bhakti movement.
2.  Saint Kabir's philosophy was greatly influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nimbarka lived centuries before Akbar, placing him firmly in the earlier phases of the Bhakti movement.  The statement incorrectly positions him as a contemporary of Akbar.  The temporal discrepancy is significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kabir predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi by several decades.  Kabir's philosophy, characterized by its syncretic nature and rejection of orthodox religious dogma, developed independently of Sirhindi's teachings.  The statement wrongly suggests a direct influence between these two figures.


**5. With reference to Mughal art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.
2.  The Taj Mahal, built under Shah Jahan, exemplifies the culmination of Mughal architectural grandeur, incorporating elements like pietra dura and Charbagh gardens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir, himself a connoisseur of art, significantly promoted individual portraits and albums, marking a shift in the focus of Mughal artistic patronage. This change reflects a growing interest in realistic representation and individual expression within the Mughal court.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Taj Mahal stands as a pinnacle of Mughal architecture, showcasing the empire's artistic and engineering prowess.  Its use of white marble, pietra dura inlay work, symmetrical design, and integration of Charbagh gardens exemplifies the sophistication and grandeur of Mughal aesthetics. The statement accurately describes the Taj Mahal's significance and its architectural features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the exact nature of religious beliefs in the Indus Valley Civilization remains debated, evidence suggests the worship of both male and female deities, indicating a more complex religious landscape than a strictly patriarchal one.  The statement oversimplifies the religious practices of the civilization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indus Valley Civilization is remarkable for its urban planning, evident in the well-organized cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  The sophisticated drainage systems and grid-like street layouts demonstrate a high level of engineering and urban management. The statement accurately reflects a key feature of the civilization's urban development.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The discovery of a copper plate inscription in Prakrit at Sohgaura near Gorakhpur suggests a significant presence of the Harappan script in eastern India.
2.  Chanhudaro, known for its bead-making industry, lacked a citadel, a feature common in other major Harappan cities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The copper plate inscription at Sohgaura is from the Mauryan period, not the Harappan Civilization.  The Harappan script remains largely undeciphered, and its extent beyond the core Indus Valley region is still debated.  While some possible Harappan artifacts have been found in distant locations, a widespread presence in eastern India is not supported by current evidence.

Statement 2 is correct. Chanhudaro is a well-known Harappan site famous for its bead-making workshops and the absence of a prominent citadel, unlike Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. This unique characteristic distinguishes it from other major urban centers of the civilization. The lack of a citadel might suggest a different social or administrative structure in this particular settlement.  The absence of a citadel at Chanhudaro is a significant archaeological finding that contributes to our understanding of the diverse urban planning within the Harappan Civilization.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment, is a core tenet of Theravada Buddhism.
2.  Image worship and elaborate rituals, which are significant aspects of Mahayana Buddhism, were largely absent in early Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of Bodhisattvas is central to Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism.  Theravada Buddhism emphasizes individual enlightenment through personal practice and adherence to the Buddha's teachings, while Mahayana Buddhism incorporates the Bodhisattva ideal, showcasing compassion and dedication to the salvation of all beings.

Statement 2 is correct. Early Buddhism, as described in the Pali Canon, focused primarily on meditation, ethical conduct, and the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Image worship and elaborate rituals developed later, particularly within the Mahayana tradition, reflecting a shift towards a more devotional and accessible form of Buddhism. This difference highlights the evolution and divergence of Buddhist practices over time.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive feature of temple architecture in the Chalukya kingdom.
2.  The Vittala Temple complex at Hampi, famous for its intricate stone carvings and musical pillars, showcases the architectural grandeur of the Vijayanagara period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana Mandapas are indeed significant architectural features, they are prominently associated with the Vijayanagara kingdom's temple architecture, not the Chalukya kingdom. The Chalukya architectural style had its own distinct characteristics, differing from the grandeur and scale often seen in Vijayanagara temples.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vittala Temple complex at Hampi is a prime example of Vijayanagara architecture's sophistication and artistry.  Its stone chariot, intricate carvings, and the famous musical pillars (though their musicality is debated) are renowned and demonstrate the high level of craftsmanship achieved during that era.  The temple's scale and design reflect the empire's power and wealth.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Saint Nimbarka, known for his Dvaitadvaita philosophy (dualistic non-dualism), was a contemporary of the Mughal emperor Humayun.
2.  The Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints, significantly contributed to the development of the Bhakti movement in South India by composing the Nalayira Divya Prabandham.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The timeline for Saint Nimbarka's life is debated, but most scholars place him several centuries before the Mughal emperor Humayun.  Precise dating of medieval saints is often challenging due to limited historical records.  Therefore, claiming him as a contemporary of Humayun is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alvars were a significant group of Vaishnava poet-saints in South India who played a crucial role in the development of the Bhakti movement. Their compositions, collectively known as the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, are highly revered and continue to influence Vaishnava traditions.  Their contributions are widely recognized as foundational to the Bhakti movement's spread in South India.

1.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri, built by Akbar to commemorate his victory over Gujarat, is primarily constructed from white marble.
2.  The tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah at Agra, commissioned by Nur Jahan, marks a significant shift in Mughal architecture toward the prominent use of white marble.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Buland Darwaza is primarily made of red sandstone, not white marble.  While the use of red sandstone was common in earlier Mughal architecture, the shift towards white marble is a notable development in later Mughal styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah is indeed a landmark in Mughal architecture. It represents a significant transition from the predominantly red sandstone structures of earlier periods to the elegant use of white marble, setting a precedent for future Mughal mausoleums.  Its intricate pietra dura inlay work further distinguishes it as a masterpiece of Mughal artistry.

2.  Al-Biruni, a scholar from Khwarazm, wrote *Kitab-ul-Hind*, a comprehensive study of Indian society, culture, and scientific knowledge, demonstrating remarkable scholarship and cross-cultural understanding.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Megasthenes' *Indica* is a significant source of information about the Mauryan Empire, the original text is lost.  Our knowledge of *Indica* comes from fragments and references in the works of later writers who quoted or summarized Megasthenes' account. The absence of the original manuscript makes its reliability a subject of scholarly discussion.

Statement 2 is correct. Al-Biruni's *Kitab-ul-Hind* is a remarkable work of scholarship that provides valuable insights into medieval India.  Written in Arabic, it covers a wide range of topics, demonstrating Al-Biruni's deep understanding of Indian culture, religion, science, and mathematics. His ability to engage with Indian knowledge systems and present them objectively is a testament to his intellectual prowess.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Modi script, while primarily associated with Marathi, had a wider usage in the past.  Its adaptability allowed it to be used for other languages in certain regions and contexts, reflecting the fluidity of script adoption in historical India.

Statement 2 is correct. Gurmukhi is the primary script used for writing Punjabi by Sikhs. While other scripts like Shahmukhi are also used for Punjabi, Gurmukhi holds significant religious and cultural importance within the Sikh community.  The use of Gurmukhi for Punjabi underscores the relationship between script and religious identity.


**9. With reference to the evolution of Delhi as a city, consider the following statements:**

1.  Prithviraj Chauhan, though known for his conflict with Muhammad Ghori, actually ruled from Ajmer, not Delhi.
2.  The city of Shahjahanabad, built by Shah Jahan, is what is now largely known as Old Delhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Prithviraj Chauhan is associated with Delhi, his primary seat of power was Ajmer.  Delhi's importance grew gradually over centuries, and various dynasties established their capitals there, making it a significant historical center.

Statement 2 is correct.  Shahjahanabad, established by Shah Jahan, is a significant part of what we now know as Old Delhi, a historically rich area containing many Mughal-era monuments.  The city’s layout and architecture reflect the grandeur of the Mughal empire at its peak.


**10. With reference to the Mauryan period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The palaces of Chandragupta Maurya at Pataliputra were primarily constructed using stone as the principal building material.
2.  Ashokan pillars, often featuring animal capitals, were used both to commemorate victories and propagate the emperor's edicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mauryan palaces were magnificent structures, wood was the primary building material, not stone.  The use of wood in large-scale constructions is a characteristic of Mauryan architecture.  Stone was used for pillars and other elements, but wood formed the bulk of the palace structures.

Statement 2 is correct. Ashokan pillars are a defining feature of Mauryan architecture and imperial power.  The pillars served a dual purpose: commemorating significant events and spreading the emperor's messages through inscribed edicts, showcasing the power of imperial communication and propaganda.  The animal capitals, often highly stylized, are a distinct artistic element of these pillars.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is aimed at being "difficult," requiring precise factual recall and analysis to avoid plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The discovery of a standardized system of weights and measures at Mohenjo-daro suggests a sophisticated centralized administration, while the absence of such a system at other sites like Kalibangan indicates regional variations in governance.
2.  While the presence of granaries at sites such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro points to efficient food storage and distribution, the lack of evidence of large-scale irrigation systems challenges the notion of a highly developed agricultural economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A standardized system of weights and measures was found across multiple Indus Valley Civilization sites, not just Mohenjo-daro. This suggests a degree of centralized control or at least widespread adherence to common standards, but doesn't definitively prove a highly centralized administration. The variations in site layouts and features suggest regional differences, but these don't necessarily contradict the existence of a common metrological system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The presence of granaries in significant Indus Valley Civilization sites points to the importance of grain storage and distribution. However, while evidence exists for some irrigation, it's not on a large scale compared to later civilizations.  The extent of reliance on rainfall versus irrigation for agriculture in the Indus Valley Civilization remains a subject of ongoing debate among archaeologists.  The lack of extensive irrigation systems suggests a less developed agricultural economy compared to some later periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the geographical distribution and stylistic characteristics of the three major early Indian temple architectural styles. The Nagara style's curvilinear shikharas and the Dravida style's pyramidal vimana are well-established features, with their respective regional distributions.  The Vesara style, as a transitional or hybrid style, indeed bridges the architectural features of the Nagara and Dravida styles, predominantly in the Deccan region.


**3. With reference to the art and archaeological history of India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are historically accurate.  The Dhauli rock-cut elephant is indeed an early example of monumental sculpture in India, dating back to the Mauryan period and preceding the Mahabalipuram rock-cut monuments. The Udayagiri Varaha, a product of the Gupta period, reflects a sophisticated level of artistic skill and expressive power, contrasting with the generally more austere styles of earlier periods.  The Gupta period is recognized for a significant flourishing of art and architecture.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Bhakti movement.  The Alvars and Nayanmars represent distinct yet interconnected strands of devotional practice within the Bhakti movement, emphasizing different deities but sharing common themes of intense devotion and accessibility to the divine.  The Vira Shaiva movement, with its social reforms and distinctive practices, is also a significant example of the broader Bhakti movement's impact on religious and social structures.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *Sulh-i-kul* aimed at religious tolerance and harmony, while Jahangir, though initially tolerant, later exhibited a more assertive stance towards certain religious groups.
2.  Shah Jahan's reign is primarily remembered for its architectural achievements, symbolized by the Taj Mahal, while Aurangzeb's reign is characterized by a more conservative and orthodox approach, leading to religious tensions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately characterize the religious policies and overall legacies of Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. Akbar's *Sulh-i-kul* policy represents a significant attempt at religious tolerance and synthesis.  Jahangir's policies, while initially more lenient, shifted towards a more rigid approach later in his reign.  Shah Jahan's architectural patronage is legendary, epitomized by the Taj Mahal, while Aurangzeb's reign saw a return to stricter religious orthodoxy and increased religious tensions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While GI tags are frequently associated with agricultural products and handicrafts, they can also be granted to manufactured goods, provided they possess a distinct geographical origin and associated qualities.  Services are generally not eligible for GI protection.

Statement 2 is correct. A GI tag protects the product's name and its association with a specific geographical area, preventing others from using the name to market similar products from different regions. This protection enhances the product's market value and fosters its unique identity.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UNESCO World Heritage Sites include both cultural and natural sites, encompassing a wide range of properties with outstanding universal value. The criteria consider both cultural and natural significance.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the designation doesn't automatically enforce legal protection within a country's domestic laws,  international law, such as the Geneva Convention, provides prima facie evidence that a World Heritage Site is culturally significant and warrants protection, particularly during wartime.  However, the effectiveness of this protection depends on the commitment of the relevant state.


**8. With reference to the Sangam literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangam poems primarily focus on religious themes, providing insights into the religious beliefs and practices of ancient Tamil society.
2.  The Sangam literature offers valuable insights into the social and economic aspects of ancient Tamil society, including its agrarian economy, trade networks, and social hierarchies.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sangam literature does touch upon religious themes, it is not its primary focus.  A significant portion of Sangam poetry deals with secular themes such as love, war, nature, and social life.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sangam literature provides rich details about the social and economic life of ancient Tamil society.  The poems depict the agrarian economy, trade relationships (both internal and external), and the social hierarchies existing at that time.


**9. With reference to early Indian philosophical schools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools, emphasizes the dualism between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter), while the Yoga school, closely related to Samkhya, focuses on the path of self-discipline and meditation to achieve liberation.
2.  The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools, also orthodox, focus on epistemology (theory of knowledge) and metaphysics, respectively, with Nyaya emphasizing logic and reasoning, and Vaisheshika emphasizing the categories of reality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to the specified format and criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the arrival of Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's invasion directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology across the entire Indian subcontinent, revolutionizing warfare.
2.  The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture, as a direct result of Babur's influence, marked a significant shift from pre-existing architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's forces utilized gunpowder weaponry, its adoption wasn't immediate or complete across the subcontinent. Gunpowder technology had already existed in India, albeit to a lesser extent, prior to Babur's arrival.  The statement oversimplifies a complex process of technological diffusion and adoption.  The impact of Babur's military technology was significant, but not a complete revolutionizing of warfare across the entire subcontinent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Babur's Timurid architectural style did feature arches and domes, suggesting some influence, it's inaccurate to say this was a complete shift from pre-existing styles.  Arch and dome architecture had been present in India for centuries before Babur's arrival, particularly in regions influenced by earlier Central Asian and Persian architectural traditions.  Babur's arrival represents a new influx of these styles but not a complete, sudden change. The statement overstates the extent of his architectural impact and ignores pre-existing influences.


**2. With reference to the earliest examples of Indian art and archaeology, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar represents an earlier style of architecture compared to the Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is considerably older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed much later (likely between the 11th and 13th centuries CE). The statement incorrectly reverses the chronological order.

Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, belonging to the Gupta period (5th century CE), precedes the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were created by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th and 8th centuries CE.  The statement accurately reflects the chronological sequence of these artistic creations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Omkareshwar is situated near the Narmada River,  its association with Satmala Hills is not entirely accurate, as it's geographically closer to other hill ranges.  Pushkar is situated near the Aravalli Range and not the Mahadeo Hills. The statement contains geographical inaccuracies.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan Civilization exhibited sophisticated urban planning, including a grid-like road network and advanced drainage systems, as evidenced by sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Harappan art primarily focused on realistic depictions of animals, with evidence of stylized representations of deities found in seals and terracotta figurines, but lacked monumental architecture comparable to later periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Archaeological evidence from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveals a remarkably organized urban layout.  The grid pattern of streets, standardized brick sizes, and sophisticated drainage systems demonstrate advanced planning and engineering capabilities far exceeding those of contemporary civilizations.  This urban planning is a defining characteristic of the Harappan Civilization.

Statement 2 is also largely correct.  While the Harappan Civilization produced impressive art, particularly in the depiction of animals (e.g., the famous bronze Dancing Girl),  the scale of their artistic endeavors was different from later civilizations.  There's evidence suggesting religious practices and potential deity representations (the Pashupati Seal is a prime example), but monumental architecture on the scale of later temples or palaces is absent. The focus was more on functional urban design and smaller-scale artistic creations.  The absence of large-scale religious structures sets them apart from later periods.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  The concept of a deified Buddha, with elaborate rituals and image worship, is a central tenet of Theravada Buddhism, emphasizing individual practice and monastic life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism. The Bodhisattva ideal, a central concept absent in Theravada Buddhism, emphasizes compassion and the selfless dedication to helping all beings achieve enlightenment.  Bodhisattvas postpone their own Nirvana to assist others on the path, demonstrating a strong emphasis on universal salvation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The deification of the Buddha and the associated rituals and image worship are characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada. Theravada Buddhism, while respecting the Buddha as an enlightened teacher, does not typically depict him as a divine being worthy of worship in the same way as Mahayana. Theravada emphasizes personal practice and adherence to the Buddha's teachings as the path to enlightenment, rather than elaborate rituals centered around images of the Buddha.


**3. With reference to temple architecture in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara style is characterized by the construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) as prominent features within temple complexes, often showcasing intricate carvings and grandeur.
2.  The Dravidian style of temple architecture, exemplified by the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, is renowned for its towering gopurams (gateway towers) and elaborate sculptural decorations, but lacks the use of Kalyana Mandapas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture.  The Kalyana Mandapas, serving as wedding pavilions, were integral parts of many Vijayanagara temple complexes.  These structures often displayed impressive craftsmanship, intricate carvings, and reflected the opulence of the Vijayanagara empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dravidian architectural style, prevalent in South India, is known for its monumental gopurams, which are imposing gateway towers often elaborately decorated with sculptures.  While the Dravidian style is rich in sculptural detail, the Kalyana Mandapas, as a distinct architectural element, are more strongly associated with the Vijayanagara style.  The distinct styles co-existed and influenced each other, but the Kalyana Mandapas stand out as a defining feature of Vijayanagara architecture.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbark, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, was a contemporary of Akbar, significantly influencing the religious climate of the Mughal court.
2. Saint Kabir, known for his syncretic philosophy blending Hindu and Islamic elements, was heavily influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure of the Naqshbandi Sufi order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Saint Nimbark was a significant figure in the Bhakti movement, he predates Akbar by several centuries.  His teachings and influence were felt long before the Mughal emperor's reign.  The statement incorrectly links a medieval saint with a much later historical figure.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Saint Kabir's philosophy was indeed syncretic, drawing from both Hindu and Islamic traditions, but he lived and taught well before Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  The temporal disconnect makes the claim of influence impossible.  Kabir's independent contributions to Bhakti thought are well-established, and his teachings predate Sirhindi's by a significant margin.


**5. With reference to the Mughal court and its patronage of arts, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mian Tansen, one of Akbar's Navratnas, was a renowned musician who composed Dhrupads primarily on Hindu deities and also composed songs in praise of his patrons.
2.  Jahangir, himself a painter, shifted the Mughal artistic focus from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album paintings, showcasing a distinct personal aesthetic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mian Tansen, a prominent member of Akbar's court, was a master of Dhrupad music. His compositions often drew inspiration from Hindu mythology and deities, reflecting the religious diversity within the Mughal court.  He also composed songs celebrating his patrons, demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between artists and rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Jahangir's personal interest in painting and his patronage significantly altered the course of Mughal art. While illustrated manuscripts continued to be produced, Jahangir's reign saw a marked increase in the creation of individual portraits, often meticulously detailed and reflecting a keen observation of both human and natural forms.  Album paintings, collections of smaller works, also gained prominence during his reign, reflecting a shift in artistic focus and presentation.


**6. With reference to the evolution of Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah, built under Jahangir's reign, marked a significant shift in Mughal architecture, being one of the first major structures primarily constructed using white marble and incorporating intricate pietra dura work.
2.  Aurangzeb, known for his austere personality, significantly advanced Mughal architecture by commissioning grand new structures like the Taj Mahal, showcasing an opulent style in contrast to his personal demeanor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah represents a pivotal moment in Mughal architectural history.  Its extensive use of white marble, a departure from the earlier preference for red sandstone, and the exquisite pietra dura inlay work (using semiprecious stones) established a new standard of elegance and sophistication that heavily influenced subsequent Mughal buildings.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aurangzeb, known for his austere and puritanical nature, actually oversaw a decline in the grandeur of Mughal architecture.  While he did commission some buildings, they generally lacked the lavishness and scale of those constructed under previous emperors.  The Taj Mahal was built under Shah Jahan, not Aurangzeb.  The statement incorrectly attributes a major architectural achievement to the wrong emperor, reflecting a significant historical inaccuracy.


**7. With reference to regional architectural styles in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajput architecture, while influenced by Mughal styles, is distinct for its imposing forts and palaces, featuring elements like hanging balconies (jharokhas) and distinctive arch designs creating bow-shaped shadows.
2.  Sikh architecture, emerging in the Punjab region, largely borrowed from Mughal and Rajput traditions but developed its own identity through the use of multiple chhatris (kiosks) atop structures, shallow cornices, and fluted domes often adorned with brass and copper.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures the essence of Rajput architecture.  While exhibiting influences from the Mughal style,  Rajput architecture developed its own distinct characteristics.  The construction of massive forts and palaces, often situated strategically, is a defining feature. The incorporation of jharokhas (hanging balconies) and the specific arch designs that cast bow-shaped shadows are unique stylistic elements.

Statement 2 is equally correct.  Sikh architecture, particularly in the Punjab region,  shows clear influences from both Mughal and Rajput styles. However, it evolved its unique features such as the use of multiple chhatris (kiosks) crowning the structures, shallow cornices, and fluted domes often covered with brass or copper for both aesthetic and structural purposes.  These features contribute to the distinct identity of Sikh architecture.


**8. With reference to the Kashmiri architectural style, consider the following statements:**

1. Early medieval Kashmiri temple architecture displays a unique blend of indigenous styles with influences from Gandhara, Chinese, and Gupta architectural traditions, evident in structures like the Martand Sun Temple.
2.  Post-14th century, under Islamic rule, Kashmiri architecture retained some indigenous elements but incorporated Islamic aesthetics, resulting in structures like the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, which notably lacks the typical dome found in many Islamic mosques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Early medieval Kashmiri temple architecture exhibits a fascinating synthesis of various influences.  The Martand Sun Temple, a prime example, shows clear links to Gandhara, Chinese, and Gupta architectural styles, reflecting the region's position on important trade routes and the interaction of diverse cultural traditions.  The unique blend of elements creates a distinct Kashmiri architectural vocabulary.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The arrival of Islamic rule in Kashmir led to a fusion of existing styles with Islamic aesthetics.  The Jamia Masjid in Srinagar exemplifies this, retaining some elements of the earlier Kashmiri tradition, such as the absence of the central dome that is characteristic of many mosques. This reflects an adaptation of Islamic architectural principles to the local context, resulting in a unique hybrid style.


**9. With reference to the geographical indications (GI) tags in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The GI tag is granted by the Government of India under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, and protects the specific qualities, traditional methods, or reputation of a product linked to a particular geographical region.
2.  As of April 2019, Karnataka had the highest number of GI-tagged products, exceeding the number registered from any other state.  The list includes textiles, agricultural produce, and handicrafts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately explains the purpose and legal basis of the GI tag in India.  The GI tag system, established under the 1999 act, aims to protect the unique characteristics and reputation of products associated with specific geographical origins. This safeguards against misuse and ensures the authenticity and quality of products such as Darjeeling tea, Kanchipuram silk, or Alphonso mangoes.

Statement 2 is also correct. As of April 2019, Karnataka held the highest number of registered GI tags among all Indian states. This reflects the state's diverse range of products, from agricultural produce and textiles to handicrafts, many of which possess unique qualities linked to their specific geographical origins. The diverse range of products reflects the state's varied geography and rich cultural heritage.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Sufi movement in India:**

1. The Chishti order, known for its emphasis on tolerance and inclusivity, became particularly prominent in Punjab, Sindh, Kashmir, and parts of Bengal, reaching its zenith under Sheikh Ruknuddin.
2. The Naqshbandi order, established by Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshbandi, gained prominence during Akbar's reign, with Ahmad Sirhindi, who styled himself as the "Mujaddid," serving as a key figure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Chishti order's prominence and its characteristics.  The Chishti silsila, known for its emphasis on tolerance and its accessibility to people from diverse backgrounds,  gained significant influence in various regions of India, including Punjab, Sindh, Kashmir, and Bengal.  The leadership of Sheikh Ruknuddin marked a high point in the order's influence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Naqshbandi order, founded by Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshbandi, indeed achieved prominence during Akbar's reign.  Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure within the order, played a significant role in shaping its ideology and expanding its influence. His self-proclaimed title of "Mujaddid" (reformer) highlights the order's ambition to revitalize Islamic practices.  The temporal connection between the Naqshbandi order and Akbar's reign is historically accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known Harappan site is located in Gujarat, showcasing advanced urban planning.
2.  Evidence of horse remains has been discovered at several major Harappan sites, indicating their use in warfare and transportation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gujarat has several significant Harappan sites like Lothal and Dholavira, Rakhigarhi in Haryana is considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The statement incorrectly attributes the largest site to Gujarat and oversimplifies the advanced urban planning which was a feature of multiple sites, not just one.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there's ongoing debate about the presence of horses in the Harappan Civilization,  the earliest confirmed skeletal remains of horses are found at Surkotada in Gujarat. However,  the widespread use of horses in warfare and transport during the Harappan period is not definitively supported by archaeological evidence.  Many sites lack conclusive evidence of horse domestication or significant use.  The statement presents an overgeneralization based on limited evidence.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own enlightenment to help others, is a central tenet.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism strictly adheres to the original teachings of the Buddha as found in the Pali Canon, rejecting later developments.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bodhisattva ideal is a core element of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to remain in the world to guide others towards enlightenment, a concept absent in Theravada Buddhism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mahayana Buddhism represents a significant departure from the early teachings of the Buddha, as preserved in the Pali Canon.  It developed new doctrines, including the concept of Bodhisattvas, the deification of the Buddha, and a greater emphasis on devotional practices and image worship.  The statement misrepresents Mahayana's relationship to the original Buddhist teachings.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana Mandapas, elaborate wedding pavilions, were a unique architectural feature of Vijayanagara temples.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's advanced irrigation systems led to high crop yields and low food prices, as described by contemporary European travelers.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kabir lived and died well before Akbar's reign.  His period is generally placed in the 15th century, while Akbar ruled from the late 16th to early 17th century.  The statement incorrectly links Kabir's life to Akbar's time.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kabir's Bhakti poetry vehemently criticized ritualistic Hinduism and the caste system. His teachings emphasized a direct and personal relationship with God, accessible to all regardless of caste or social standing.  This emphasis on equality and direct devotion was a defining characteristic of his philosophy.


**5. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, the emphasis was primarily on illustrated manuscripts, while Jahangir shifted the focus towards individual portraits and albums.
2.  Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in Akbar's court, is also credited with significant contributions to Mughal painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Mughal school of painting under Akbar focused largely on illustrated manuscripts, such as the Akbarnama.  Jahangir's reign, however, saw a shift toward individual portraits, often featuring detailed depictions of flora, fauna, and the emperor himself.  This evolution reflects the changing artistic tastes and preferences of the Mughal rulers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mian Tansen was a highly accomplished musician, one of the Navratnas in Akbar's court.  However, he's not known for any contributions to painting. The statement wrongly attributes artistic skills to a musician.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Siri, the second city of Delhi, did indeed reflect a fusion of Seljuk architectural influences (brought by artisans fleeing Mongol invasions) and existing local styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jahanpanah, while ambitious, was strategically located *between* Qila Rai Pithora and Siri, indicating its integration within the existing urban fabric of Delhi rather than being a completely separate entity. The statement misrepresents its geographical location.


**8. With reference to  Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional variations of Indian temple architecture.
2. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar exemplifies the Dravida style of temple architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are indeed three major architectural styles found in Indian temples, each with distinct regional characteristics and features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple is a prime example of the *Nagara* style, not the Dravida style. The statement incorrectly assigns the temple to the wrong architectural classification.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Sun Temple at Konark and the Mahabalipuram monuments were indeed recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both the Kalka-Shimla Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, they were inscribed in different years. The statement incorrectly pairs them chronologically.


**10. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Alvars were Vaishnava poet-saints who primarily composed in Tamil and Telugu.
2.  Basavanna is associated with the Virshaiva movement, which emphasized the worship of Shiva in the form of the linga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah is indeed notable for its extensive use of white marble, representing a transition from the earlier preference for red sandstone in Mughal architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's reign, characterized by a puritanical approach, actually saw a decline in the patronage of elaborate architectural projects.  While some construction continued, it lacked the scale and grandeur of previous Mughal eras.  The statement misrepresents the architectural trends during Aurangzeb's rule.


**12. With reference to the Mauryan Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The palaces at Kumrahar, the site of Pataliputra, were primarily constructed using wood as the main building material.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Accounts from the time, such as those of Megasthenes, indicate that wood was a primary building material in the Mauryan palaces at Pataliputra. While stone was also used, wood played a dominant role in their construction.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ashokan pillars are indeed known for being monolithic, meaning they were carved from a single, massive piece of stone (typically Chunar sandstone). This demonstrates sophisticated engineering and craftsmanship.


**13. With reference to post-Mauryan art, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gandhara school of art, known for its Greco-Buddhist style, flourished primarily in the region of modern-day Bihar.
2.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha were primarily used as residential quarters by Buddhist monks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, does indeed contain musical notations that correspond to the seven notes of the raga Kharaharapriya. This highlights the ancient origins of Indian musical traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Amir Khusrau made significant contributions to Indian classical music, notably influencing the development of the ghazal and qawwali,  he is not credited with inventing the sitar.  The statement falsely attributes the invention of the sitar to him.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization exhibited sophisticated urban planning, evidenced by grid-patterned roads and advanced drainage systems in cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Archaeological findings at Harappan sites consistently reveal evidence of large-scale monumental architecture, including extensive palaces and temples dedicated to a pantheon of deities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Harappan civilization is renowned for its remarkably advanced urban planning.  Excavations at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa have uncovered meticulously planned cities with grid-like street layouts, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, indicating a high level of engineering and societal organization. This demonstrates a clear understanding of urban design and infrastructure management far ahead of its time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization possessed impressive artistic skills, evident in their sculptures, seals, and pottery, there's limited conclusive evidence of large-scale monumental architecture such as extensive palaces and temples in the sense understood in later civilizations.  Structures interpreted as granaries and public baths have been found, but the scale and nature of their religious architecture remain a subject of ongoing debate and research. The presence of religious elements is undeniable, through artifacts depicting potential deities, but the existence of large-scale temples is not definitively proven. The absence of clear evidence for monumental palaces and temples contrasts sharply with the sophistication of their urban planning and craftsmanship in other areas.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to aid others in achieving Nirvana.
2. The concept of a single, universally accessible Buddha, rather than a historical figure, is central to Theravada Buddhism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving Buddhahood, choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide and assist others on the path to enlightenment. This concept of selfless compassion and dedication to the welfare of all sentient beings is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism and distinguishes it from other Buddhist traditions. The emphasis on the Bodhisattva path reflects the Mahayana focus on universal salvation and the compassionate engagement with the world.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement reverses the characteristics of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.  The concept of a single, universally accessible Buddha is a key element of Mahayana Buddhism, often represented in the form of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Theravada Buddhism, on the other hand, places greater emphasis on the historical Buddha Siddhartha Gautama and his teachings as recorded in the Pali Canon. While both schools revere the Buddha, their interpretations and emphasis differ significantly.  The Mahayana's conception of the Buddha is more expansive and less tied to a single historical individual.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara architectural style is characterized by the construction of Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) as prominent features within temple complexes.
2.  The Chalukya dynasty's architectural influence is primarily seen in the Vijayanagara's adoption of the Nagara style of temple construction.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style is indeed known for its incorporation of Kalyana mandapas within its temple complexes. These large, ornate pavilions, often elaborately carved, were dedicated to celebrating divine marriages and served as significant spaces within the temple precinct. Their inclusion reflects the Vijayanagara's emphasis on grand scale and intricate detailing in their temple architecture. The presence of Kalyana mandapas is a distinctive feature that helps identify Vijayanagara-style temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire's architecture drew inspiration from various preceding styles, including the Chalukyas, the primary influence wasn't the Nagara style. The Vijayanagara style is a unique synthesis of various South Indian architectural traditions (Chola, Hoysala, Pandya, and Chalukya), incorporating elements from those styles but developing its own distinct characteristics.  The Nagara style is primarily associated with North Indian temple architecture, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas (towers), which are not a defining feature of Vijayanagara architecture. The Vijayanagara style shows a blend of Dravidian and other South Indian styles, demonstrating a more regionally specific influence.


**4. With reference to Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Kabir's teachings significantly blended elements of Hinduism and Sufism, transcending religious boundaries.
2.  Kabir was a direct disciple of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Naqshbandi Sufi order.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Saint Kabir's philosophy is a remarkable example of religious syncretism.  His teachings drew heavily from both Hindu and Sufi traditions, emphasizing the unity of God and rejecting sectarian divisions.  He incorporated elements of Bhakti poetry and Sufi mysticism, creating a unique spiritual path that resonated across religious boundaries.  His poems often criticized both Hindu orthodoxy and Islamic ritualism, promoting a simple, direct path to spiritual realization independent of religious dogma.  This syncretic approach made his teachings accessible and influential across communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kabir predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi by several decades; therefore, a direct discipleship is impossible. Kabir lived in the 15th century, while Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi lived in the 16th-17th centuries. This chronological discrepancy makes the claim of direct discipleship inaccurate.  While both were influential figures in the religious landscape of India, their periods of activity were distinct, and there's no historical evidence to support a teacher-student relationship between them.  The significant temporal gap between their lives makes this statement historically inaccurate.


**5. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Jahangir's patronage of art led to a significant shift in Mughal painting, emphasizing individual portraits and naturalistic depictions of flora and fauna.
2.  The Mughal school of painting is characterized by its consistent adherence to a purely Persian style, rejecting any Indian artistic influences.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Emperor Jahangir, himself a keen observer and patron of the arts, is credited with significantly influencing the direction of Mughal painting.  His reign saw a notable shift towards greater realism and detail in portraiture.  Paintings from his era often showcase meticulous depictions of individuals, animals, and plants with remarkable accuracy and attention to detail. This naturalistic approach, coupled with the emphasis on individual portraits, marks a significant stylistic development within the Mughal school.  Jahangir's personal interest in natural history is reflected in the numerous botanical and zoological studies produced during his reign.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Mughal school of painting, while initially influenced by Persian miniature painting, was far from a purely Persian style.  Over time, it evolved into a unique hybrid style that incorporated various Indian artistic influences and techniques.  The blending of Persian and Indian artistic traditions is a defining characteristic of the Mughal school. The Mughal emperors actively patronized artists from diverse backgrounds, resulting in a rich synthesis of artistic styles. This fusion of artistic traditions produced a distinctive and highly influential style of painting.  The claim of consistent adherence to a purely Persian style ignores the considerable Indian artistic contributions to the Mughal school.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization's script remains undeciphered, hindering a complete understanding of their societal structures and beliefs.
2.  Extensive evidence of horse-drawn chariots has been found in Harappan sites, indicating their widespread use in warfare.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The script of the Indus Valley Civilization remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of archaeology. Despite numerous attempts, scholars have yet to decipher its meaning. This lack of decipherment significantly limits our understanding of their social organization, religious beliefs, and administrative systems.  The undeciphered script represents a major obstacle to fully reconstructing the civilization's history and culture. The unique nature of the script and the lack of comparative material have hampered progress in decipherment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization possessed a sophisticated understanding of animal husbandry, there is limited, if any, conclusive evidence of widespread use of horse-drawn chariots.  While animal bones have been found at various sites, the evidence for horse-drawn chariots is not consistently present or definitively established. The absence of substantial evidence contrasts with the abundance of other artifacts that reveal a complex and advanced society.  Other forms of transport and animal usage were prevalent, but the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots lacks robust archaeological support.


**7. With reference to  Geographical Indications (GI) tags in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, provides legal protection to products with specific qualities linked to their geographical origin.
2.  The GI tag applies equally to both goods and services, ensuring that only registered users can utilize the associated product names.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, is a crucial piece of legislation in India that aims to protect the intellectual property rights of products associated with specific geographical regions.  This act grants legal protection to products that possess unique qualities, reputation, or characteristics directly linked to their place of origin. The GI tag acts as a certification of authenticity and quality, safeguarding the interests of producers and consumers.  The act defines the procedures for registration and protection of GIs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GI tag system in India is specifically designed for goods and does *not* extend to services.  Only products originating from a particular region and possessing distinctive qualities are eligible for GI registration.  This focus on tangible goods reflects the aim of protecting the reputation and quality associated with specific geographical areas and their production methods.  The inclusion of services would significantly broaden the scope and potentially dilute the effectiveness of the GI tag system.  The act explicitly limits its application to goods.


**8. With reference to the  rock-cut architecture of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves, known for their highly polished interior walls, were initially constructed for Ajivikas during the Mauryan period.
2.  The Ajanta caves are primarily characterized by their extensive mural paintings, showcasing a blend of Indian and Greco-Roman artistic styles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period, are a remarkable example of early rock-cut architecture.  They are particularly notable for their highly polished interior surfaces, a unique feature achieved through a sophisticated technique. These caves were originally constructed for the Ajivika sect, a religious group that existed during the Mauryan era. The caves' construction and dedication to the Ajivikas demonstrate the Mauryan empire's religious tolerance and patronage of various sects. The exceptional craftsmanship and the historical context make them significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta caves do indeed feature magnificent mural paintings, the statement about a blend of Indian and Greco-Roman styles is an oversimplification. The Ajanta murals primarily reflect Indian artistic traditions, particularly those of the Gupta period. Although there might be subtle influences from various sources, the overall style is distinctly Indian, showcasing the indigenous artistic sensibilities and techniques of the time.  Attributing a significant Greco-Roman influence to the Ajanta murals is an overstatement. The murals are celebrated for their exquisite depictions of Buddhist narratives and their mastery of painting techniques.



**9. With reference to the  religious and cultural landscape of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nath tradition, associated with Gorakhnath, is a branch of Shaivism that emphasizes yogic practices and spiritual discipline.
2.  The Vaishnava tradition, prominently represented in the works of Narsinh Mehta, is primarily focused on the worship of Lord Shiva.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nath tradition, with Gorakhnath as a central figure, is indeed a branch of Shaivism.  It emphasizes yogic practices, spiritual discipline, and the pursuit of self-realization.  Gorakhnath's teachings combined elements of yoga, tantra, and Shaivism, contributing to a distinct spiritual path.  The Nath tradition has a significant following, particularly in the Himalayan region, and its emphasis on yogic practices has influenced various aspects of Hindu religious and cultural life. The tradition is associated with warrior asceticism and resistance to oppression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Narsinh Mehta was a prominent figure in the Vaishnava tradition, not associated with the worship of Lord Shiva.  The Vaishnava tradition centers on the worship of Vishnu and his various avatars, including Krishna, Rama, and others. Narsinh Mehta's bhajans (devotional songs) are primarily dedicated to Krishna and reflect the Bhakti movement's emphasis on devotion and love for God.  Attributing his works to the worship of Shiva is a misrepresentation of his religious affiliation and the core tenets of the Vaishnava tradition.  His work is a cornerstone of Gujarati literature and religious devotion.


**10. With reference to the  ancient Indian ports and maritime trade, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal, situated near present-day Ahmedabad, served as a significant port city during the Indus Valley Civilization, facilitating trade with Mesopotamia.
2.  Muziris, located on the Malabar Coast, primarily traded in textiles and pottery with Southeast Asian nations during the Mauryan period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal, an important site of the Indus Valley Civilization, is recognized for its evidence of a sophisticated dockyard and its role in maritime trade.  Archaeological findings suggest that Lothal served as a major port city, facilitating trade connections with Mesopotamia and other regions.  The presence of a well-designed dockyard and other related infrastructure indicates a high level of maritime technology and commercial activity during the Indus Valley Civilization.  Its location along an ancient river system also facilitated trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Muziris on the Malabar Coast was indeed a major port, its peak prominence in trade was *not* during the Mauryan period. Muziris flourished as a major trading center during later periods, notably engaging in extensive trade with the Roman Empire and other regions. The statement incorrectly links Muziris's primary trading activities with Southeast Asia and the Mauryan period.  Its trade network was extensive and spanned across various regions and time periods, but its prominence with Southeast Asia was not its main focus during the Mauryan era.  The statement mismatches the time period and trade focus.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is intended to be high, requiring deep knowledge and the ability to discern subtle differences in factual information.


**1. With reference to the architectural contributions of Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's architectural style significantly deviated from pre-existing architectural traditions in India, introducing entirely novel structural elements.
2.  The introduction of gunpowder technology by Babur directly impacted the defensive architecture of forts and palaces in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur did introduce some Timurid architectural elements, his contributions were more of an overlay on existing styles rather than a radical departure.  The use of arches and domes, for instance, predated Babur in India.  His mosques in Panipat and Rohilkhand, though significant, didn't represent a complete break from previous architectural norms.  The evolution of Indian architecture was a gradual process of assimilation and adaptation.

Statement 2 is correct. Babur's introduction of gunpowder weaponry and tactics had a significant, albeit indirect, impact on Indian military architecture.  The need to defend against more powerful artillery necessitated changes in fort designs, including thicker walls, improved bastions, and modifications to defensive strategies. This marks a turning point in the construction of fortifications.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the earliest examples of Indian art and architecture:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is chronologically older than the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram represent a later phase of rock-cut architecture compared to the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that achieving a perfectly even distribution of correct answers across (a), (b), (c), and (d) while maintaining high difficulty and avoiding obviousness is challenging, but the attempt is made.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning, evidenced by grid-patterned roads and advanced drainage systems.
2.  Harappan art predominantly featured depictions of deities, with few representations of animals or everyday life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro reveal a remarkably well-planned urban layout with grid-like street patterns, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. This demonstrates advanced engineering and urban planning skills for its time.  The precision and scale of this planning are significant indicators of a developed urban civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the religious beliefs of the Harappan civilization are still being deciphered,  archaeological findings show a wide variety of artistic representations, including numerous animal figures (bulls, elephants, rhinoceroses, etc.),  seals depicting possible deities, and artifacts reflecting everyday life.  The artistic scope was broader than solely focusing on depictions of deities.  The interpretation of many symbols and figures remains a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.


**2. With reference to the Mahayana Buddhist features, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others.
2.  Image worship and elaborate rituals were central practices in early Hinayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bodhisattva ideal is a core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide others towards enlightenment. This concept emphasizes compassion and the collective path to liberation.  It represents a significant shift from the earlier emphasis on individual enlightenment found in Theravada Buddhism (a branch of Hinayana).

Statement 2 is incorrect. Early Hinayana Buddhism, particularly Theravada, generally avoided image worship and elaborate rituals, focusing instead on meditation, ethical conduct, and the study of the Buddha's teachings. The development of image worship and complex ritualistic practices is more associated with the later Mahayana school of Buddhism.


**3. With reference to temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Kalyana Mandapas" were a characteristic feature of Chandela temple architecture, known for their intricate carvings and sculptures.
2.  The Vijayanagara empire's temples are distinguished by the inclusion of "Kalyana Mandapas" (wedding pavilions) as significant architectural elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chandela temple architecture is renowned for its exquisite sculptures and intricate carvings, the "Kalyana Mandapas" (wedding pavilions) are more strongly associated with the Vijayanagara style. The Chandela temples, particularly those at Khajuraho, are known for their distinctive Nagara style and often feature elaborate erotic sculptures, but not Kalyana Mandapas as a defining feature.

Statement 2 is correct.  Vijayanagara temples are characterized by the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas, which were large, ornate structures within the temple complex dedicated to wedding ceremonies.  These pavilions often showcase impressive architectural details and reflect the grandeur of the Vijayanagara empire. Examples can be found in the Vittala Temple complex at Hampi.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement saints, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbarkacharya was a contemporary of the Mughal emperor Akbar, actively engaging in religious dialogues.
2. Saint Kabir's teachings were significantly influenced by the Sufi mystic Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarkacharya's lifespan predates Akbar's by several centuries.  He is generally placed in the 12th-13th centuries, while Akbar ruled from 1556-1605.  Therefore, they were not contemporaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (Mujadidi Alf Sani) lived much later than Kabir.  Kabir's teachings were influenced by various schools of thought, including Hinduism and Sufism, but not by Sirhindi, who was a staunch opponent of Akbar's religious syncretism and a leading figure in the revivalist movement within Islam.


**5. With reference to Mughal imperial patronage of the arts, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Akbar is known for his patronage of illustrated manuscripts, while Jahangir shifted the emphasis towards individual portraits and album art.
2.  Shah Jahan's reign saw a decline in the importance of painting and a greater focus on architectural projects like the Taj Mahal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's reign is associated with a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, notably the Akbarnama. Jahangir, himself a keen painter and connoisseur, further developed this tradition, but with a pronounced shift towards individual portraits, often featuring detailed depictions of flora and fauna, and the creation of albums of paintings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shah Jahan is indeed best known for his magnificent architectural achievements (Taj Mahal, Red Fort, etc.), his reign did not see a decline in the importance of painting.  The Mughal school of painting continued to flourish under his patronage, though perhaps with a somewhat lesser emphasis compared to the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir.


**6.  With reference to the Maratha Empire's relationship with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. In the early 18th century, the Marathas agreed to provide a large cavalry contingent to the Mughal emperor in exchange for control over the resources of Gujarat.
2. The Maratha's agreement to serve the Mughal emperor with a cavalry contingent was contingent upon their right to levy Chauth and Sardeshmukhi in the Deccan and South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Maratha agreement to supply a cavalry contingent to the Mughal emperor was not primarily linked to gaining control over Gujarat's resources. While economic considerations were certainly a factor in Maratha-Mughal relations, the main condition for their military service was the continuation of their existing revenue extraction rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  The crucial condition for the Marathas' agreement to serve the Mughal emperor with a cavalry contingent was the continued right to levy Chauth (a tax of one-fourth of the revenue) and Sardeshmukhi (an additional surcharge) in the Deccan and South India.  This was a key aspect of their power and influence in the region.  This arrangement reflected the complex power dynamics between the Marathas and the weakening Mughal empire.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties ruled successively under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara kingdom.
2. The Hoysala dynasty coexisted alongside the Vijayanagara Empire, maintaining a separate kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The four dynasties mentioned (Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu) were the major ruling dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire, each succeeding the other in a historical progression.  They represented different phases in the empire's history and contributed to its rise, expansion, and eventual decline.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hoysala dynasty predates the Vijayanagara Empire and initially existed as a separate, powerful kingdom in South India.  While the Vijayanagara Empire eventually expanded and exerted influence over the former Hoysala territories, the Hoysala kingdom, while diminished, did not fully come under the Vijayanagara's direct rule during the initial years of the empire's existence.



**8. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization is Rakhigarhi, located in present-day Haryana.
2.  Chanhudaro, a site in present-day Pakistan, is distinguished by its lack of a citadel, unlike most other Indus cities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Based on current archaeological evidence, Rakhigarhi in Haryana is considered to be one of the largest, if not the largest, known sites of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Its extensive size and the artifacts discovered there provide valuable insights into the urban organization and social structure of the civilization.

Statement 2 is correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, is unique among Indus Valley Civilization sites for its apparent lack of a citadel – a fortified area typically found in other major cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. This difference in urban planning has led to various interpretations regarding its social and political organization.


**9. With reference to the features of the Ashokan pillars, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sarnath pillar's abacus and animal figures form the basis of India's national emblem.
2.  Ashokan pillars were typically constructed from a single piece of granite, showcasing remarkable engineering skills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The national emblem of India is derived from the abacus and animal figures (lion, bull, horse, elephant) atop the Sarnath pillar erected by Emperor Ashoka.  The four animals represent the four directions and symbolize the spread of Dharma. The wheel of law (Dharma Chakra) on top further reinforces this symbolism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ashokan pillars are indeed impressive examples of monolithic structures, they were primarily made of Chunar sandstone, not granite.  The use of Chunar sandstone, its polishing to a high luster, and the precise carving of the pillars demonstrate advanced stone-cutting and engineering techniques of that era.


**10. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period, were initially constructed for the Ajivika sect.
2.  The Nasik caves, a group of Buddhist rock-cut caves, primarily reflect the artistic styles of the Mahayana school of Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves in Bihar, known for their highly polished interiors, were constructed during the Mauryan period, specifically under Ashoka and his grandson Dasharatha.  They were originally built for the Ajivika sect, a contemporary religious group distinct from both Buddhism and Jainism.  Later, some caves might have been used by Buddhists or Jains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nasik caves are Buddhist rock-cut caves, their artistic styles primarily reflect the Hinayana school of Buddhism in their early phases.  Later additions and influences show the gradual introduction of Mahayana elements, but the earliest phases prominently showcase the Hinayana aesthetic.


**11. With reference to the Gupta period art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school of art, known for its Greco-Buddhist sculptures, flourished during the Gupta period.
2.  The Mathura school of art, characterized by its distinctive style of sculpting Buddha images, originated during the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhara school of art, known for its fusion of Greco-Roman and Buddhist artistic elements, flourished primarily during the Kushana period (1st-3rd centuries CE), preceding the Gupta period.  While some influences may have lingered, the Gandhara school's peak was not during the Gupta era.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mathura school of art, famous for its early sculptures of the Buddha and other Buddhist figures, emerged and developed significantly during the Kushana period but continued to flourish during the Gupta period. The Gupta period saw a refinement and further development of the Mathura style, which became a major influence on subsequent Indian sculpture.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999,  was enacted to protect the unique identity and quality of products linked to specific geographical regions. It came into effect in 2003, providing a legal framework for GI registration and protection in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  According to the provided text, as of April 2019, Karnataka held the highest number of registered GI-tagged products among all Indian states. This highlights the rich diversity of agricultural, handicraft, and other products originating from Karnataka that have received GI status.


**13. With reference to the ancient Indian ports, consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, located in present-day Gujarat, served as a significant port for maritime trade during the Indus Valley Civilization.
2.  Muziris, situated on the Malabar Coast in Kerala, was primarily known for its export of textiles and grains to Roman markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal, located near present-day Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is recognized as a major port city of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Archaeological evidence suggests its importance in maritime trade, with finds indicating connections to Mesopotamia and other regions.  The discovery of a dockyard further supports its role as a significant port.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Muziris on the Malabar Coast was a major port during the early centuries CE, it was primarily known for its export of spices, semi-precious stones, and other luxury goods to the Roman Empire and other regions.  Textiles and grains were also traded, but spices formed a larger part of its trade.


**14. With reference to  Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samaveda is considered a source of early Indian musical knowledge, containing melodic patterns and chants.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, is considered a crucial source of early Indian musical knowledge. It contains melodic patterns (samans) and chants that are closely linked to the development of Indian classical music.  The Samavedic chants were integral to Vedic rituals and laid the foundation for later musical traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bharata Muni's Natyashastra is indeed a highly influential text on the performing arts, including music, its compilation predates the Gupta period.  It is generally placed between 200 BCE and 200 CE,  making it an earlier and more foundational text on Indian music theory than other later treatises.


**15. With reference to  Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of "Anekantavada" emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, accepting multiple perspectives as valid.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Anekantavada is a central philosophical concept in Jainism, emphasizing that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives.  It rejects the notion of a single, absolute truth and accepts the validity of diverse viewpoints, provided they are logically consistent and based on available evidence.  It is a cornerstone of Jain epistemology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sthanakvasi sect in Jainism is known for its strict adherence to non-violence (Ahimsa), it does not allow for the use of material possessions.  It emphasizes a minimalist lifestyle, renouncing worldly attachments to a much greater extent than many other Jain sects.  This strict stance on material possessions is a key distinguishing feature of the Sthanakvasi sect.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While later dynasties added to the complex, its core structure reflects the architectural preferences of that initial phase of the Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Alai Darwaza, a stunning gateway located within the Qutub Minar complex, is a prime example of the architectural style of the Khilji dynasty, specifically under Alauddin Khilji.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Fatehpur Sikri, while significantly influenced by Persian architecture, showcases a blend of styles, including elements of Hindu architecture.  This fusion of architectural styles reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in incorporating diverse artistic influences.  The city's architecture is not uniform but rather a multifaceted demonstration of eclecticism.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the arrival of Babur in India and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology across the entire Indian subcontinent, revolutionizing warfare.
2. The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture can be solely attributed to Babur's influence and the Timurid architectural style he brought with him.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur did introduce more sophisticated gunpowder weaponry, gunpowder technology already existed in India before his arrival.  His impact was significant in terms of the *quality* and *application* of gunpowder weaponry, but not its introduction. The statement oversimplifies a complex process of technological diffusion and adaptation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The arch and dome were present in Indian architecture before Babur's arrival.  While the Timurid style he brought did influence the development of Mughal architecture, it was not the sole source of these architectural elements.  Existing architectural traditions in India were integrated and adapted, leading to a unique synthesis.  The statement presents a simplistic, causal link that ignores the pre-existing architectural context.  The statement falsely attributes a singular origin to a complex architectural evolution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves is from the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallavas during the 7th century CE.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's Timurid architectural influences did contribute to the development of Indo-Islamic architecture,  the arch and dome were already present in Indian architecture before his arrival, notably in pre-existing structures of the Delhi Sultanate period. Babur's impact was more of a stylistic evolution and fusion rather than a complete replacement.  The statement oversimplifies a complex architectural development.

Statement 2 is correct.  Babur's introduction of gunpowder weaponry and artillery significantly altered military architecture.  Fortifications needed to adapt to withstand cannon fire, leading to changes in design, material use, and the construction of stronger, more robust defensive structures. This technological shift had a profound impact on the evolution of forts and military buildings in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur's arrival, his campaigns introduced more advanced gunpowder weaponry and tactics, significantly impacting warfare in the region.  This led to a shift in military power and the rise of the Mughal Empire. The use of cannons and other artillery became more prevalent, leading to changes in fortifications and battle strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Babur's architectural style, while influenced by Timurid traditions, did not primarily focus on integrating Indian elements.  His architectural contributions largely introduced Central Asian and Persian architectural features to the Indian subcontinent, laying the groundwork for later Mughal architectural developments that would, in subsequent reigns, incorporate more Indian styles.  The introduction of the arch and dome, for example, were significant aspects of the Timurid style that he brought with him, not a fusion with existing Indian styles. The assertion that he primarily fused styles is historically inaccurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lingaraja Temple, a significant example of Kalinga architecture (a sub-style of Nagara), showcases the characteristic features of the Nagara style, including its tall, curvilinear shikhara (tower) and intricate sculptural ornamentation.  Its construction reflects the evolution of temple architecture in eastern India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, though a remarkable piece of sculpture, is not representative of Dravidian architecture.  The Dravidian style is primarily associated with South India and is characterized by its gopurams (tower gateways) and pyramidal vimana (shrine towers). The Udayagiri caves and their sculptures belong to the Gupta period and are associated with the Nagara style's influence, not the Dravidian style. The Udayagiri caves are rock-cut structures, a different architectural typology than the free-standing stone temples typical of the Dravidian style.

Statement 2 is correct. Pushkar, located in Rajasthan, is indeed situated in the Aravalli range and is a highly revered pilgrimage site associated with Lord Brahma, one of the principal deities in the Hindu pantheon.  Its association with Brahma distinguishes it from other pilgrimage sites. The temple dedicated to Brahma in Pushkar is one of the few such temples in India, further emphasizing its uniqueness and religious significance.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tabo Monastery is indeed a crucial example of Himalayan Buddhist architecture, combining elements of Indian and Tibetan styles.  Its location in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, its age, and its rich artistic heritage make it a significant site for understanding the evolution of Buddhist art and architecture in the region.  The monastery's intricate murals and sculptures reflect the fusion of cultural influences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lhotsava Lakhang Temple is located in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh and not in the Zanskar Valley of Ladakh. This misidentification of the temple's location renders the statement inaccurate.  While the temple is significant to local Buddhist traditions, its architectural style does not represent a distinct regional adaptation unique to the Zanskar Valley. The geographical error negates the statement's claim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did benefit from trade through its coastal ports, its financial system primarily revolved around a robust land revenue system. This system, based on agricultural production, formed the backbone of the empire's economy.  The statement overemphasizes one aspect while neglecting the dominant factor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas, having attained enlightenment, choose to remain in the cycle of samsara to guide and assist others on their path to Buddhahood.  This emphasis on compassion and selfless service distinguishes Mahayana from earlier Buddhist schools that focused more on individual liberation. The concept of a Bodhisattva represents a significant shift in Buddhist philosophy, emphasizing collective salvation and the importance of compassion in achieving enlightenment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by its extensive use of image worship and elaborate rituals.  The development of iconic representations of the Buddha and other deities played a crucial role in the spread and popularization of Mahayana Buddhism.  These images and rituals served as focal points for devotion and provided tangible means for engaging with Buddhist teachings and practices. The emphasis on ritual and image worship made the faith more accessible to a wider population.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) were indeed an important architectural element in temple complexes, they were a prominent feature of Vijayanagara architecture, not Chalukya.  Vijayanagara temples are renowned for their intricate carvings, grand scale, and incorporation of elements like Kalyana Mandapas, reflecting the empire's wealth and artistic sophistication. Chalukya architecture, while impressive, had different stylistic features.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vijayanagara Empire frequently clashed with the various Deccan Sultanates, including the Golconda Sultanate. Krishnadeva Raya, one of the most powerful Vijayanagara rulers, engaged in several conflicts with the Golconda Sultanate, with one notable battle taking place at Golconda. These conflicts highlight the dynamic political landscape of South India during the medieval period and the continuous struggle for power and territory between the Vijayanagara Empire and its neighboring Muslim kingdoms.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Zabti system, a significant land revenue system in Mughal India, was actually introduced by Sher Shah Suri, not Akbar.  While Akbar made modifications and improvements to the revenue system, the fundamental framework of the Zabti system, which involved detailed land surveys and assessment based on crop yields, was established under Sher Shah Suri.  This system aimed to improve the efficiency and fairness of revenue collection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Muhtasib in the Mughal administration was not a military officer. Instead, the Muhtasib was an official responsible for upholding public morals and enforcing religious laws.  His role was primarily concerned with regulating social conduct and ensuring compliance with Islamic norms, rather than military functions.  This highlights the significance of religious authority and social control within the Mughal administrative structure.  The Muhtasib's responsibilities extended to various aspects of public life, including market regulation and the prevention of unlawful activities.

Gunpowder technology, though not entirely new to India, played a crucial role in Babur's victory, showcasing the transformative impact of military technology on warfare.


Statement 2 is also correct. Babur's establishment of the Mughal Empire in India marked the beginning of the Timurid dynasty's rule in the subcontinent.  His architectural contributions, while not extensive in his relatively short reign, laid the groundwork for the future development of Mughal architecture.  The introduction and wider adoption of architectural elements like arches and domes, characteristic of Timurid and Central Asian styles, significantly impacted the architectural landscape of India, influencing subsequent Mughal constructions.  The combination of these elements with existing Indian architectural styles contributed to the unique Indo-Islamic architectural tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, not the Zanskar Valley. Spiti Valley is a high-altitude region in the Himalayas, known for its remote beauty and rich Buddhist heritage. The Tabo Monastery, with its ancient murals and artifacts, is a significant site of Buddhist pilgrimage. The Zanskar Valley is located in a different part of the Himalayas.


Statement 2 is correct. The Alchi Temple Complex is indeed located in Ladakh, a region in the northern Himalayas known for its unique blend of Tibetan and Indian Buddhist culture. The Alchi temples, with their distinctive architectural style and exquisite murals, represent a significant chapter in the history of Buddhist art and architecture in the region.  Ladakh's high-altitude landscape and its isolation contributed to the preservation of unique artistic traditions.


**9. With reference to Indian art and culture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Panchayatan style of temple construction is characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines.
2.  The term "Panchayatan" also refers to an administrative body in ancient India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayatan style is a specific architectural arrangement in Hindu temple construction, where a central shrine is surrounded by four smaller shrines, arranged symmetrically at the cardinal directions.  This arrangement represents a cosmic symbolism and is often found in temples of the Nagara style. The Panchayatan plan reflects the hierarchical organization of the divine and the cosmos.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Panchayatan" does not refer to an ancient Indian administrative body. While village councils or assemblies existed in ancient India, they were not typically referred to as Panchayatan. This term is primarily associated with temple architecture.  The term's association with temple architecture distinguishes it from administrative or political structures.  Confusing the architectural term with an administrative function would be a common error.


**10. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves were originally constructed for Ajivikas by Chandragupta Maurya.

Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire, patronized the construction of these caves, showcasing the religious tolerance and diversity of the Mauryan era. The caves' polished interior surfaces and sophisticated architectural design highlight the advanced engineering skills of the time.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra are renowned for their exquisite mural paintings. These paintings, created over several centuries, depict scenes from the Jataka tales, Buddhist narratives that illustrate the previous lives of the Buddha.  The Ajanta paintings are masterpieces of Indian art, showcasing the skill and artistic sophistication of the painters.  The vibrant colors and expressive style of the paintings have captivated viewers for centuries.


**11.  With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The people of the Indus Valley Civilization possessed elaborate palaces and grand temples comparable to those found in later civilizations.
2.  Evidence suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning and impressive engineering feats, evidence does not support the existence of elaborate palaces or grand temples comparable to those of later civilizations. The architectural remains suggest a focus on civic structures and residential buildings, rather than monumental religious edifices.  The absence of large-scale religious structures distinguishes the Indus civilization from later periods.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological findings indicate the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The discovery of various figurines and seals depicting both male and female figures, often with suggestive religious symbolism, suggests a complex religious system that included both masculine and feminine divine aspects.  The presence of both male and female deities reflects a potentially diverse and inclusive religious landscape.


**12. With reference to Buddhist rock-cut caves, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Chaitya is a place of worship, while a Vihara is a dwelling place for monks.
2.  The term "Chaitya" specifically refers to a stupa located at the far end of a cave, while "Vihara" denotes the hall axial to it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, a Chaitya is a prayer hall or place of worship, typically containing a stupa, while a Vihara is a monastery or dwelling place for monks.  This distinction reflects the different functions within the monastic complex.  Chaityas provided a space for communal worship and religious practice, while Viharas served as residences and living quarters for the monastic community.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chaityas often contained a stupa, the term does not exclusively refer to a stupa at the far end of the cave. The stupa was a central feature of the Chaitya, but the layout varied.  Viharas were not necessarily halls axial to Chaityas, and their architectural arrangement could be independent or integrated with Chaityas within a rock-cut complex.  Oversimplifying the architectural relationship between Chaityas and Viharas could lead to misconceptions.


**13. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three main regional variations in Indian temple architecture.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three major regional styles of Hindu temple architecture in India.  The Nagara style is prevalent in North and Central India, the Dravida style in South India, and the Vesara style in parts of Karnataka and adjoining regions.  These styles are distinguished by their unique features in shikhara (tower) design, ornamentation, and overall structure.  Understanding the regional variations in temple architecture is crucial for appreciating the diversity of Indian artistic traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vesara style is not predominantly found in the northern regions of India.  Instead, it is mainly associated with the transition zone between the Nagara and Dravida styles, primarily in Karnataka and neighboring areas.  This style blends features of both the Nagara and Dravida styles, reflecting the cultural and artistic interactions between different regions.  Assigning the Vesara style to the north would be geographically inaccurate.


**14. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization primarily used cotton for manufacturing textiles.
2.  The Indus Valley Civilization was characterized by a strong emphasis on religious elements, evident in its monumental architecture and iconography.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that cotton was used for textile production in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The discovery of cotton fibers and spindle whorls indicates a well-developed textile industry.  Cotton cultivation and textile production were likely significant economic activities, contributing to the civilization's prosperity and trade networks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization was not characterized by a strong emphasis on religious elements as evident in monumental architecture and iconography. While religious practices existed, as suggested by some artifacts, they were not as overtly dominant or expressed in monumental architecture compared to later civilizations.  The focus seems to have been more on urban planning, sanitation, and efficient resource management.  Overemphasizing the religious aspect would be a misinterpretation of the available evidence.


**15. With reference to Gupta period cave paintings in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bagh Caves are the only surviving example of Gupta period cave paintings besides the Ajanta Caves.
2.  The Gupta period cave paintings are primarily found in the Ellora Caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bagh Caves in Madhya Pradesh represent one of the very few surviving examples of Gupta period cave paintings, alongside the Ajanta Caves. The Bagh Caves' paintings are renowned for their vibrant colours and narrative style, illustrating scenes from Hindu epics and Jataka tales.  The limited number of surviving Gupta period cave paintings underscores the scarcity of such artifacts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ellora Caves contain impressive rock-cut architecture and sculptures, they are not primarily known for Gupta period cave paintings.  The Ellora Caves' artistic heritage spans different periods and religious traditions, and the Gupta period is not the dominant style represented in its cave paintings.  Attributing Gupta period cave paintings primarily to Ellora would be a misidentification.


**16. With reference to the location of famous temples in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Virupaksha Temple is located in Bhadrachalam.
2.  The Vijaya-Vittala Temple with its 56 musical pillars is located in Hampi.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Allahabad pillar inscription, a significant historical record, is associated with Samudragupta, a powerful Gupta emperor.  The inscription provides valuable information about Samudragupta's reign, his military campaigns, and his administrative policies.  The inscription's detailed accounts offer crucial insights into the Gupta Empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hathigumpha inscription is not associated with Ashoka.  It is actually associated with Kharavela, a king of the Kalinga dynasty.  The inscription, found in a cave at Udayagiri, provides information about Kharavela's reign and his military conquests.  Confusing the Hathigumpha inscription with Ashoka would be a historical error.

This temple complex, with its intricate carvings and vast scale, reflects the Khmer Empire's power and artistic achievements.  Suryavarman II's patronage played a pivotal role in shaping this iconic structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sri Mariamman Temple is an important Hindu temple, it is not primarily known for its extensive use of bronze sculptures.  While bronze sculptures may be present, they are not the defining characteristic of this temple's architectural style or artistic heritage.  The temple's architectural features and other artistic elements are more prominent aspects.  Overstating the prominence of bronze sculptures would be inaccurate.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vikramshila University, a renowned Buddhist institution of higher learning, was located in present-day Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh.  Its significance as a center of Buddhist studies and scholarship during the Pala dynasty period is well-established.  Its location in Bihar places it within the historical context of the region's rich Buddhist heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Hemkund Gurudwara, a significant Sikh pilgrimage site, is located in Uttarakhand, not Himachal Pradesh.  Its location in the Garhwal Himalayas adds to its spiritual importance and attracts numerous pilgrims.  The temple's location in Uttarakhand is geographically accurate.


**20. With reference to monasteries in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dhankar Monastery is located in Sikkim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dhankar Monastery is located in Himachal Pradesh, not Sikkim.  Himachal Pradesh, a state in the Himalayas, is known for its numerous monasteries and rich Buddhist heritage. Dhankar Monastery is a significant site of Buddhist pilgrimage. Sikkim is another Himalayan state with its own distinct Buddhist tradition.


Statement 2 is correct. Kye Monastery is indeed located in Arunachal Pradesh, a state in Northeast India.  Arunachal Pradesh is known for its diverse cultures and rich Buddhist heritage, and Kye Monastery is an important part of this heritage.  The monastery's location in Arunachal Pradesh is geographically accurate.


**21. With reference to archaeological findings in the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal is primarily known for its dockyard.
2.  Kalibangan is primarily known for its terracotta replica of a plough.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal, a significant site of the Indus Valley Civilization, is indeed renowned for its well-preserved dockyard. This dockyard provides compelling evidence of the Indus people's advanced maritime technology and trade networks. The dockyard's construction and design reflect a high level of engineering skill and understanding of maritime principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kalibangan did yield significant archaeological findings, including evidence of agriculture, it is not primarily known for a terracotta replica of a plough.  Although agricultural implements might have been found, other sites are more prominently associated with such artifacts.  Attributing the terracotta plough primarily to Kalibangan would be inaccurate.


**22. With reference to the statement "The statute of Gomateswara at Shravanabelagola represents the last tirthankar of the Jains", consider the following statements:**

1. This statement is correct.
2. The statement is incorrect because the Gomateshwara statue represents Bahubali, the son of the first Tirthankar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement that the Gomateshwara statue at Shravanabelagola represents the last Tirthankara is false.  The Gomateshwara statue, a monolithic marvel of Jain sculpture, depicts Bahubali, a significant figure in Jainism but not the last Tirthankara.  Bahubali is the son of Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gomateshwara statue correctly represents Bahubali, the son of Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara in Jainism. Bahubali's story is a central narrative in Jain mythology, and the statue's monumental scale and artistic execution are highly significant.  The statue's depiction of Bahubali reflects the importance of this figure in Jain tradition.

1. Hoysala monuments are primarily found in Hampi and Hospet.
2. The Hoysaleswara Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hoysala monuments are not primarily found in Hampi and Hospet.  Hampi is associated with Vijayanagara architecture. The Hoysala architectural style is distinct and is primarily found in areas of Karnataka, particularly around Halebid and Belur.  These sites are renowned for their intricate carvings and unique architectural features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysaleswara Temple, a prime example of Hoysala architecture, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  The temple's intricate carvings and star-shaped plan reflect the sophisticated artistry of the Hoysala period.  The dedication to Lord Shiva is a significant aspect of the temple's religious significance.


**24. With reference to Harappan sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization's art frequently depicted cows.
2.  Tigers were commonly represented in Harappan seals and terracotta art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological evidence indicates that cows were frequently depicted in Harappan art.  The presence of bovine figures on seals and other artifacts suggests the importance of cattle in their society and economy.  The depiction of cows reflects the likely significance of cattle rearing in their livelihood.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While various animals were depicted in Harappan art, tigers were not commonly represented.  Other animals such as bulls, elephants, and rhinoceroses are more frequently found in their artistic representations. The absence of frequent tiger depictions highlights the selection of animal imagery in their art.


**25. With reference to the association of art styles with historical periods, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara School of Art is associated with the Kushanas.
2. The Ajanta paintings are associated with the Mughals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gandhara School of Art, a significant artistic style characterized by its blend of Greco-Buddhist influences, is indeed associated with the Kushana period. The Kushana Empire's patronage of Buddhist art led to the flourishing of this distinctive style, evident in sculptures and other artistic creations.  The Gandhara style's unique features reflect the cultural exchange between India and Central Asia during that era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ajanta paintings are not associated with the Mughal period.  The Ajanta cave paintings date back to much earlier periods, primarily from the Satavahana and Vakataka periods.  These paintings depict scenes from Buddhist Jataka tales and showcase a distinct artistic style.  Assigning these paintings to the Mughals would be a major chronological error.


**26. With reference to the Coinage Act, 2011, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Coinage Act, 2011 repealed the Coinage Act, 1906.
2.  The Coinage Act, 2011 defines a "coin" to include only metallic coins stamped by the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Coinage Act, 2011 replaced the older Coinage Act of 1906.  The new act consolidated and updated the legal framework related to coinage in India.  The replacement reflects the need for a modernized legal framework to address contemporary issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Coinage Act, 2011 defines "coin" more broadly than just metallic coins.  The definition includes coins made of any metal or other material stamped by the government or an authorized entity.  This broader definition encompasses various types of coins, including commemorative coins and even one-rupee notes issued by the government.  Restricting the definition solely to metallic coins would be an incomplete and inaccurate representation.


**27. With reference to the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore, consider the following statements:**

1.  King Kanthiraya Narasa's coins depicted the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu.
2.  Tipu Sultan exclusively used the Saka era in his coinage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The coinage of King Kanthiraya Narasa of the Wodeyar dynasty in Mysore indeed featured the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu. The depiction of this particular avatar reflects the religious beliefs and iconography prevalent during that period.  The use of religious imagery on coinage was a common practice in many Indian kingdoms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tipu Sultan did not exclusively use the Saka era in his coinage. He actually used two different eras in his coins, reflecting the diverse influences and administrative practices of his reign.  Restricting his coinage to only one era would be an inaccurate simplification.


**28. With reference to the geographical indications (GI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hyderabad Haleem is the only Indian dish to have received GI status.
2.  The GI tag is valid for 10 years and is renewable for another 10 years after the initial period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Hyderabad Haleem, a popular dish, is indeed the only Indian dish to have received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag.  The GI tag protects the unique characteristics and reputation of this dish, associating it with its place of origin.  The GI tag for Hyderabad Haleem highlights the importance of culinary heritage.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The GI tag in India is indeed valid for 10 years from the date of application and is renewable for another 10 years, and subsequently for further periods of 10 years.  This renewal provision ensures continued protection for products with established geographical origins and unique characteristics.  The renewable nature of the GI tag ensures long-term protection.


**29. With reference to recently registered Geographical Indications (GIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kandhamal Haldi (turmeric) received GI status in 2018-19.

**Correct

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  The largest Harappan site, Rakhigarhi, yielded evidence of granaries, a cemetery, and a sophisticated drainage system, indicating a well-organized urban center.
2.  Chanhudaro, unlike most other Harappan cities, lacked a citadel, suggesting a different social or political structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Rakhigarhi, located in Haryana, is widely considered the largest known Harappan site. Excavations have revealed extensive evidence of urban planning, including substantial granaries, a well-defined cemetery indicating organized burial practices, and a complex drainage system showcasing advanced engineering skills. This points to a highly organized and sophisticated urban settlement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Chanhudaro, situated in present-day Pakistan, stands out among other Harappan sites for its lack of a prominent citadel.  The absence of a citadel, a typical feature in other Harappan cities often associated with administrative or elite control, suggests a potentially different social structure or power distribution compared to other urban centers of the civilization. This unique characteristic makes Chanhudaro a significant site for understanding the diverse aspects of Harappan urbanism.  The absence of a citadel might indicate a decentralized power structure or different societal organization compared to other Harappan cities.  Further research is still needed to fully understand the implications of this unique feature.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the deification of the Buddha, portraying him as a divine being worthy of worship and veneration, a departure from earlier Buddhist traditions.
2.  The concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to aid others in achieving enlightenment, is a central tenet of Theravada Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key distinguishing feature of Mahayana Buddhism is the deification of the Buddha.  Unlike earlier forms of Buddhism, which focused on the Buddha as a historical figure and teacher, Mahayana Buddhism elevated the Buddha to a divine status, a concept that facilitated the development of elaborate rituals and iconography centered around Buddha worship.  This shift towards a more devotional and theistic understanding of the Buddha had a profound impact on the spread and development of Buddhism in various parts of Asia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of Bodhisattvas is indeed central to Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving enlightenment, choose to postpone their own Nirvana to guide and assist others on the path to enlightenment.  This selfless act of compassion and dedication is a cornerstone of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy and practice, emphasizing the importance of helping all sentient beings achieve liberation.  Theravada Buddhism, on the other hand, focuses more on individual practice and attainment of Nirvana.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana mandapas, ornate wedding pavilions, were a distinctive architectural feature of temples built during the reign of the Chalukya dynasty.
2.  The Hazara Rama Temple at Hampi, a masterpiece of Vijayanagara architecture, was constructed during the reign of Krishnadeva Raya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) were indeed a significant architectural element in South Indian temple complexes, they were not exclusively associated with the Chalukya dynasty.  Though present in Chalukya architecture, these structures became a prominent feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, reflecting the empire's sophisticated artistic and architectural achievements.  The statement wrongly attributes them solely to the Chalukyas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hazara Rama Temple at Hampi, a remarkably preserved example of Vijayanagara architecture, was indeed constructed during the reign of Krishnadeva Raya.  The temple's intricate carvings, depicting scenes from the Ramayana, showcase the high level of artistic skill and the grandeur of the Vijayanagara court. Its association with Krishnadeva Raya highlights his patronage of the arts and his contribution to the architectural legacy of the empire.  The temple's exquisite detail and the historical context of its construction under Krishnadeva Raya make it an important site for understanding Vijayanagara art and architecture.



**4. With reference to Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu.
2.  The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, is an example of Nagara style temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, attributed to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, which were created by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th and 8th centuries CE. This chronological difference highlights the evolution of rock-cut architecture in India over a considerable span of time. The Dhauli elephant exemplifies early Mauryan art, while the Mahabalipuram monuments represent a later, more developed style.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is a prominent example of Kalinga architecture, a distinct regional style that developed in Odisha.  It exhibits characteristics that differentiate it from the Nagara style, which is predominantly found in North and Central India.  While both styles share some common features, the Lingaraja Temple's unique design elements and construction techniques clearly place it within the Kalinga architectural tradition. The statement incorrectly assigns it to the Nagara style.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal Emperors:**

1.  Jahangir, known for his patronage of art, shifted the emphasis in Mughal painting from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album format.
2.  Akbar, while a significant patron of arts and architecture, primarily focused on illustrated manuscripts and less on individual portraits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Under Jahangir's reign, Mughal painting underwent a significant shift. While Akbar's era saw the flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir, himself a connoisseur of art, promoted a greater focus on individual portraits and the album format. This change reflected a growing interest in realism and capturing the individual likeness of the subject, marking a stylistic evolution in Mughal painting.  His personal interest in painting also led to the creation of many remarkable portraits of himself, his family members, and court officials.

Statement 2 is also correct. Akbar's patronage of art and architecture was indeed substantial.  He fostered a vibrant artistic environment, particularly in the realm of illustrated manuscripts, which became highly sophisticated and detailed during his reign.  However, the emphasis on individual portraits as a dominant form of artistic expression was more pronounced during the reign of Jahangir and later emperors. The statement accurately reflects Akbar's preference for illustrated manuscripts as a primary medium in Mughal art.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The discovery of horse remains at Surkotada, Gujarat, indicates the use of horse-drawn chariots for warfare during the Harappan period.
2.  The Harappans worshipped both male and female deities, as evidenced by the discovery of numerous figurines and seals depicting both.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While horse remains have been found at Surkotada, there's limited conclusive evidence to suggest widespread use of horse-drawn chariots for warfare in the Harappan Civilization. The presence of horses doesn't automatically imply their extensive use in military contexts.  More archaeological evidence is needed to definitively establish the role of horses and chariots in Harappan warfare.


Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings from Indus Valley Civilization sites demonstrate the worship of both male and female deities. Numerous figurines and seals depict a range of deities, reflecting a complex religious system that included both male and female figures. This evidence contradicts the notion of a single dominant deity and points to a multifaceted religious landscape in the Harappan Civilization.  The discovery of these artifacts provides valuable insights into the religious beliefs and practices of the Harappans.


**7. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lodi dynasty introduced the double dome architectural feature, characterized by a hollow inner dome within the main dome, primarily for structural reinforcement and to reduce the inner height.
2.  The Khilji dynasty, known for its Seljuk-influenced architecture, primarily employed red sandstone in its constructions and introduced the arcuade style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties, is credited with introducing the double dome architectural feature. This innovative design involved constructing a smaller, hollow dome inside the main dome. This served a dual purpose: enhancing the structural integrity of the dome and reducing the overall interior height, which was often a stylistic preference. The double dome became a distinctive element in Lodi-era architecture.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Khilji dynasty's architectural style drew heavily from Seljuk traditions.  Red sandstone was a preferred building material during their reign, and they are known for introducing the arcuade style, characterized by a series of arches, into their constructions. The use of red sandstone and the arcuade style became significant elements of Khilji-era architecture, reflecting the influence of West Asian architectural styles on the Delhi Sultanate.


**8. Consider the following statements about different schools of Indian architecture:**

1.  The Hoysala style, characterized by its stellate plan and intricate carvings in soft soapstone, flourished primarily in the region of present-day Karnataka.
2.  The Nagara style of temple architecture is primarily associated with the southern regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Hoysala school of architecture, renowned for its distinctive stellate (star-shaped) ground plan and incredibly detailed carvings executed in soft soapstone (chlorite schist), flourished predominantly in Karnataka.  The temples built during this period showcase exceptional craftsmanship and artistic skill, reflecting the rich cultural and artistic heritage of the Hoysala kingdom.  The intricate carvings and unique architectural features of Hoysala temples are a testament to the region's artistic achievements.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nagara style of temple architecture is primarily associated with the northern and central regions of India, not the south.  Southern India's architectural traditions are more closely aligned with the Dravidian style, which has its own distinct features and characteristics.  The statement incorrectly attributes the Nagara style to the south.  The Nagara style is easily recognizable by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), while the Dravidian style features a pyramidal or stepped structure.


**9. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a prominent Vaishnava saint, is considered the founder of the Ramanandi Sampradaya and is credited with using Hindi to propagate his teachings, making them accessible to a wider audience.
2.  Kabir, known for his syncretic philosophy blending elements of Hinduism and Islam, belonged to the Saguna school of Bhakti, emphasizing the formless and attributeless nature of God.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ramananda, a significant figure in the Bhakti movement, is widely regarded as the founder of the Ramanandi Sampradaya.  A key contribution of Ramananda was his use of Hindi in disseminating his teachings, a crucial step in making the Bhakti message accessible to a broader section of the population beyond the confines of Sanskrit scholarship.  His emphasis on devotion to Rama and his use of the vernacular language significantly contributed to the Bhakti movement's widespread appeal.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Kabir, a celebrated Bhakti saint, is renowned for his syncretic philosophy that seamlessly blended Hindu and Islamic beliefs. However, he belonged to the Nirguna school of Bhakti, which focused on the formless and attributeless nature of God—a stark contrast to the Saguna school, which emphasized God's form and attributes.  The statement incorrectly assigns Kabir to the Saguna school.  Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of God and criticized both Hindu and Muslim orthodoxy, reflecting his unique and inclusive approach to spirituality.


**10. With reference to foreign travelers who visited India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler, extensively described the vibrant and densely populated Indian cities, including Delhi, in his travelogue, "Rihla,"  and also highlighted the efficiency of the postal system.
2.  Domingo Paes, a Portuguese traveler, provided a detailed account of the Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Krishnadeva Raya, emphasizing the empire's advanced irrigation systems and bustling markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ibn Battuta's "Rihla" offers a rich and detailed account of his travels in India during the 14th century.  His observations provide valuable insights into the social, cultural, and economic aspects of India during the Delhi Sultanate. He vividly described the bustling cities, particularly Delhi, emphasizing their dense populations and vibrant atmosphere.  He also noted the effectiveness of the Indian postal system, highlighting its role in communication and trade.


Statement 2 is also correct. Domingo Paes's account of the Vijayanagara Empire under Krishnadeva Raya is a crucial source for understanding the empire's economic and administrative systems. He detailed the empire's advanced irrigation technologies that contributed to high agricultural yields.  He also described the thriving markets, emphasizing the abundance of goods and the empire's prosperous commercial activities. His observations offer a glimpse into the grandeur and economic strength of the Vijayanagara Empire.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the concept of Bodhisattvas, individuals who postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  The practice of image worship and the performance of elaborate rituals were central tenets of Theravada Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide others toward enlightenment. This emphasizes compassion and the collective path to liberation, a significant departure from the Theravada focus on individual enlightenment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Image worship and elaborate rituals are characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism.  Theravada Buddhism, considered the older branch, emphasizes a simpler, more monastic approach to practice, focusing on individual meditation and adherence to the Buddha's original teachings.  While reverence for the Buddha exists, the elaborate iconography and ritualistic practices are more prominent in Mahayana. The emphasis in Theravada is on personal discipline and understanding of the Four Noble Truths.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, including well-developed drainage and grid-patterned streets, but lacked monumental architecture comparable to later civilizations.
2.  Evidence suggests the Harappans engaged in extensive trade networks, exchanging goods such as cotton textiles, beads, and precious metals with Mesopotamia and other regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Harappan cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa demonstrate remarkable urban planning for their time, with grid layouts, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. However, while they had impressive public works, the scale and grandeur of their architecture are less pronounced than in later civilizations like the Mauryan or Gupta periods.  The absence of large palaces or temples comparable to later periods is a key characteristic.

Statement 2 is also correct. Archaeological evidence strongly supports the existence of extensive trade networks connecting the Harappan civilization with Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, and possibly even regions further afield.  The discovery of seals, beads, and other artifacts from distant lands in Harappan sites, and vice-versa, points to a well-established system of long-distance exchange. The presence of materials like lapis lazuli (from Afghanistan) and cotton textiles underscores this extensive trade.


**3. With reference to the Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gupta coinage featured the depiction of various deities, including Vishnu and Shiva, reflecting the religious diversity of the time, but did not incorporate symbols related to royal power or authority.
2.  The Gupta empire witnessed a flourishing of literature, art, and architecture, including the development of the classical Sanskrit language and the creation of the Ajanta cave paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gupta coinage is well-known for its artistic merit and often depicted deities, but also frequently included symbols of royal power and authority.  The use of images of the king himself, along with emblems representing sovereignty, was a common feature.  The coins were not solely religious in their iconography.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gupta period is considered a golden age in Indian history, marked by significant advancements in various fields.  Classical Sanskrit literature thrived, numerous artistic styles emerged, and impressive architectural structures were built.  The Ajanta cave paintings, renowned for their exquisite murals depicting Buddhist narratives, are a prime example of Gupta-era artistic achievement. This period also saw significant advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and other sciences.


**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara rulers patronized a distinctive style of temple architecture characterized by the use of Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) and intricate carvings, but did not show interest in other art forms.
2.  The empire's economy was primarily agrarian, but it also engaged in significant trade, exporting textiles, spices, and precious stones to various parts of the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara style of temple architecture is indeed notable for its Kalyana mandapas and elaborate carvings, the empire's artistic patronage extended far beyond temple construction.  Painting, sculpture, and other art forms also flourished under the Vijayanagara rulers.  The artistic achievements were diverse and not limited to a single architectural style.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vijayanagara economy was predominantly agrarian, relying heavily on agriculture.  However, the empire also played a significant role in regional and international trade, exporting various goods, including textiles (especially cotton), spices, and precious stones to markets in West Asia, Southeast Asia, and even Europe. The port cities facilitated this trade.


**5. With reference to the  Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Akbar saw a shift in Mughal architectural style, with the increased use of white marble, intricate pietra dura work, and a blending of Persian and Indian elements.  
2.  Shah Jahan's reign is associated with the construction of the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum made primarily of red sandstone and known for its symmetrical design.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While red sandstone was used extensively earlier, Akbar's reign did see the increased use of white marble, particularly in buildings like the Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb.  The combination of Persian and Indian architectural styles reached a high point during his rule, and pietra dura (inlaid gemstones) became a more prominent decorative element in later Mughal architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Taj Mahal, a masterpiece of Mughal architecture built by Shah Jahan, is primarily constructed from white marble, not red sandstone. The use of white marble, intricate inlay work, and symmetrical design are defining features of the Taj Mahal and represent a culmination of Mughal architectural styles.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bodhisattva ideal is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to guide and help others achieve enlightenment. This emphasis on compassion and universal salvation is a distinctive feature of Mahayana.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While stupas became more elaborate and significant in the Mahayana period, their origins predate Mahayana Buddhism.  Stupas were already present in earlier Buddhist traditions, serving as important sites for veneration and the preservation of relics.  The Mahayana tradition certainly expanded upon the use and symbolism of stupas, but it did not originate them.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire is renowned for its magnificent temples and impressive public works, showcasing a high level of artistic and architectural skill.  The Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) are indeed a notable architectural feature of Vijayanagara temples.  Their patronage of art and architecture significantly contributed to the cultural richness of the period.

Statement 2 is partially correct but overstates the immediacy of the empire's collapse. The Battle of Talikota was a devastating defeat for Vijayanagara, but the empire did not disintegrate immediately.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reign is indeed associated with a significant development in Mughal miniature painting, blending Persian and Indian artistic traditions. While the text mentions Ustad Mansoor as a famous painter of Akbar's court, the existence of a prominent artist named Daswant in Akbar's court is not explicitly contradicted by historical records.  The fusion of styles during Akbar's time is a well-established aspect of Mughal art history.

Statement 2 is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The Naqshbandi order, with its emphasis on a more austere and internalized spiritual practice, did gain influence during the reign of Aurangzeb, who was himself associated with this order.  The contrast between the Chishti and Naqshbandi orders highlights the diversity within Sufi traditions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Bhakti movement *shunned* the use of Sanskrit, choosing instead to write in the language of the common people, leading to a rise in regional languages. The statement presents the opposite of the actual historical development.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly identifies Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas as one of the most revered Hindu texts, written primarily in Braj Bhasha with Persian influences. This directly supports the statement.  Thus, only statement 2 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text identifies the Samkhya school as the oldest, founded by Kapil Muni, who is said to have written the Samkhya Sutra.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's association with Gaudiya Vaishnavism and his devotion to Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text identifies Mirabai as a devotee of Lord Krishna, not Shiva, and her compositions were in Braj Bhasha, not Sanskrit. The statement contains two factual inaccuracies.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. With reference to the  scripts used in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gurmukhi script is predominantly used by Sikhs for writing Punjabi, while Hindus primarily use Devanagari.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**10.  Consider the following statements regarding Indian classical music:**

1.  The seven swaras (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) represent the twelve shrutis (microtones) in Hindustani classical music.
2.  The concept of "Raga" in Indian classical music is solely defined by the ascending (Aroha) sequence of notes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the seven swaras are fundamental, they do *not* represent the twelve shrutis. The text clarifies that there are 22 shrutis, with only 12 audible, and the swaras are a subset of these.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The description of raga emphasizes both the ascending (Aroha) and descending (Avaroha) sequences of notes as crucial components of its melodic structure.  The statement oversimplifies the definition. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**11. With reference to  Hindustani classical music Gharanas, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kirana Gharana, known for its Khyal style, is primarily associated with the regions bordering Maharashtra and Karnataka.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**12. With reference to Semi-classical styles of Hindustani music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Thumri style, often devotional or romantic in nature, is predominantly sung in a male voice.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that Thumri is usually sung in a *female* voice, contrasting with other styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage traces the origin of Tappa to camel riders' folk songs and highlights its emphasis on fast, complex rhythmic patterns.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**13. With reference to Carnatic music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kriti form in Carnatic music consists of Pallavi, Anu Pallavi, and Charana, with improvisation primarily within the Charana section.
2.  Purandara Dasa is widely recognized as the "father" of Carnatic music, known for his compositions in Sanskrit.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While improvisation is possible in various sections, the Pallavi, Anu Pallavi, and Charana are the core structural elements of a Kriti, as described in the text.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Purandara Dasa is considered a foundational figure in Carnatic music, the text doesn't mention his compositions being *primarily* in Sanskrit. The text doesn't specify the language of his compositions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is more accurate.


**14. With reference to Indian folk dances, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chhau dance, inscribed by UNESCO, is characterized by vigorous martial movements and the use of masks in all its regional styles.
2.  The Kalbelia dance, also recognized by UNESCO, is performed by women of the Kalbelia community in Rajasthan and is inspired by the movements of peacocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The text mentions UNESCO recognition and the martial movements, but notes that not all regional styles of Chhau use masks (Mayurbhanj Chhau doesn't).  The statement is not fully accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kalbelia dance is inspired by snake movements, not peacocks, as clearly indicated in the text.  Therefore, only a portion of statement 1 is correct, making (a) the closest answer.  The question highlights the inaccuracies and nuances in the descriptions.


**15. With reference to Assamese dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sattriya dance, an amalgamation of Assamese dance forms, primarily focuses on narratives from the Ramayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Sattriya dance does incorporate elements from other Assamese forms and is devotional in nature. However, the text mentions that Sattriya narratives primarily focus on Vishnu's mythological stories, not specifically the Ramayana.  While the Ramayana might be included, it's not the primary focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Ankia Naat is performed by male monks ("Bhokots"), not female dancers. Therefore, only a part of statement 1 is correct.  The question tests the precise details about the dance forms.




**1. With reference to the architectural features introduced during the reign of Babur, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival marked the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology in India's military architecture.
2. The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was significantly promoted by Babur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Babur's invasion of India in 1526 marked a turning point in Indian history, significantly impacting its military and architectural landscape.  Statement 1 is correct because while gunpowder was known in India prior to Babur's arrival, his army's effective use of artillery and firearms significantly influenced the design and construction of fortifications and military architecture in the subsequent Mughal period.  The introduction of superior weaponry necessitated adaptations in defensive structures.  Statement 2 is also correct. Babur, being a Timurid prince, brought with him the architectural traditions of Central Asia, characterized by the prominent use of arches and domes. Although these architectural elements existed in India before, Babur's patronage and the subsequent Mughal architectural style heavily leaned on this Timurid influence, making it a defining feature of the era's buildings, mosques, and tombs.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the impact of Babur's reign on Indian architecture. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are true. Option (a) and (b) are partially correct but not entirely accurate as they miss the significant architectural changes brought by Babur.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding early Indian art and architecture:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, is a Mauryan-era sculpture dating back to the 3rd century BCE, while the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh, belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE).  The Mauryan period significantly predates the Gupta period, making the Dhauli Elephant older. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, was constructed in the Kalinga architectural style over several centuries, starting primarily in the 11th century CE, while the Rock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, were created by the Pallava dynasty primarily in the 7th and 8th centuries CE.  Thus, the Mahabalipuram monuments are not necessarily younger than the Lingaraja Temple, given the temple's construction spanned several centuries. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is true. Option (b) and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the chronological order of these structures.


**3. With reference to places of pilgrimage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Omkareshwar is located in the Satmala Hills, while Srisailam is situated in the Nallamala Hills.
2. Pushkar is situated in the Aravalli Hills, not the Mahadeo Hills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga is located on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, which is indeed part of the Satmala range. Srisailam, a significant pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  Statement 2 is also correct. Pushkar, famous for its Brahma Temple and annual fair, is situated in the Aravalli Range of Rajasthan, not the Mahadeo Hills. The Mahadeo Hills are located in a different part of India. Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate regarding the geographical location of these pilgrimage sites.


**4. With reference to Buddhist shrines in India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is a significant Buddhist site located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, not the Zanskar Valley. Zanskar is another region in the Himalayas known for its own distinct monasteries and cultural heritage. Statement 2 is correct. The Alchi Temple Complex is indeed situated in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, and is renowned for its unique blend of Tibetan and Kashmiri architectural styles. It is a remarkable example of Buddhist art and architecture in the region.  Option (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect as statement 2 is true.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan is a well-known architectural style in Indian temple construction, particularly prevalent in North India.  It features a central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines, creating a symmetrical layout symbolizing the five elements or deities.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Panchayatan temples can be found in various regions and associated with different sects, it's not specifically tied to the Varkari sect. The Varkari sect has its own distinct traditions and architectural preferences in temple design.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately defines Panchayatan in the context of temple architecture.


**6. With reference to the sculptures at Ajanta Caves, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta Caves feature a prominent sculpture depicting the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha.
2. The Ajanta Caves primarily showcase sculptures depicting scenes from the Ramayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta Caves are renowned for their stunning murals and some sculptures, including a significant depiction of the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha—the Buddha's death and attainment of Nirvana. This sculpture is a powerful representation of Buddhist iconography. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta Caves contain numerous murals and sculptures, they primarily depict scenes from the Jataka tales and other Buddhist narratives, not the Ramayana. The Ramayana is a prominent theme in Hindu art and architecture, but not a central theme in the Ajanta Caves. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately describes a key sculptural element found in the Ajanta Caves.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as a personal prayer chamber for Emperor Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did use the Ibadat Khana for personal reflection and prayer, its primary function was not solely as a private chamber.  Statement 2 is correct.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's memoirs were originally written in Chagatai Turkish, a language prevalent in Central Asia.
2. The official language of the Mughal court during Akbar's reign was exclusively Persian.

1. The Samkhya school emphasizes the duality of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2. The Yoga school, founded by Patanjali, primarily focuses on achieving liberation through the practice of Karma Yoga.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Samkhya philosophy is indeed characterized by its dualistic approach, distinguishing between Purusha and Prakriti.  While Patanjali is associated with Yoga, the Yoga school emphasizes various paths to liberation, including Raja Yoga (mental discipline) rather than solely Karma Yoga (selfless action). Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of Indian history, art, culture, and philosophy.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's understanding and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization is characterized by the presence of massive palaces and temples, indicating a highly stratified society.
2.  Indus Valley Civilization's religious practices involved the worship of both male and female deities, as evidenced by archaeological findings.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning with large structures, there is no conclusive evidence of massive palaces or temples in the same way as later civilizations.  The interpretation of the discovered structures is still debated among archaeologists.  The absence of monumental religious architecture contrasts sharply with later Indian civilizations.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological evidence from Harappan sites reveals the presence of figurines representing both male and female deities, suggesting a complex religious system with a possible dualistic or matriarchal element. The discovery of seals depicting a "proto-Shiva" figure and the prevalence of Mother Goddess figurines support this assertion. The absence of large-scale temples doesn't negate the existence of religious beliefs and practices.


**2. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves, known for their unique architecture, were originally constructed for Ajivikas during the reign of Emperor Ashoka.
2. The Badami caves, showcasing intricate carvings and sculptures, represent the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves, renowned for their remarkable architectural achievements, particularly the use of polished rock-cut chambers, were indeed carved out during the Mauryan period, specifically for the Ajivika sect. Emperor Ashoka, known for his patronage of various religious groups, played a crucial role in their construction.  This fact is well-documented in historical records.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest surviving ones in India.  Other rock-cut caves, particularly those from the pre-Mauryan period, predate the Badami caves.  The chronology of rock-cut architecture in India is a complex subject with ongoing research and debates among scholars.


**3. With reference to Buddhist history, tradition, and culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex, known for its intricate murals, is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex, a remarkable example of Himalayan architecture, is situated in the Spiti Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is not located in the Zanskar Valley. It is situated in the Spiti Valley, a remote region in Himachal Pradesh, known for its rich Buddhist heritage.  The monastery's location in the Spiti Valley is crucial to its historical significance and cultural context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Alchi Temple Complex is not located in the Spiti Valley. It is found in Ladakh, a region known for its unique blend of Tibetan Buddhist culture and art. The Alchi Temple Complex's location in Ladakh is essential to understanding its architectural style and artistic influences.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbark, a prominent figure in the Bhakti movement, was a contemporary of Akbar the Great.
2. Saint Kabir, known for his syncretic philosophy, was significantly influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka's period is generally placed much earlier than the reign of Akbar.  While the exact dates of his life are debated, most scholars place him several centuries before Akbar. This chronological inaccuracy renders the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Saint Kabir's teachings predate Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's life.  Kabir's philosophy, characterized by its syncretic blend of Hindu and Muslim traditions, was formed and disseminated long before Sirhindi's influence on the religious landscape. The temporal disparity between the two figures makes the statement untenable.


**5. With reference to the art and archaeological history of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, a significant Mauryan-era sculpture, predates the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves.
2. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, a masterpiece of Kalinga architecture, is older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, a product of the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is indeed older than the Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, which dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE). This chronological order is well-established in the study of Indian art history.  The significant temporal difference between the two artworks is a key point.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, while a remarkable example of Kalinga architecture, is not older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram. The Mahabalipuram monuments were constructed by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th and 8th centuries CE, while the Lingaraja Temple's construction spanned several centuries, beginning in the 11th century CE and continuing through later periods.  The construction timelines of these structures indicate that Statement 2 is incorrect.


**6. With reference to the Mughal Emperors, consider the following statements:**

1. Emperor Akbar's reign saw a significant shift from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's court produced magnificent illustrated manuscripts, the significant shift toward individual portraits and albums as the primary focus of patronage actually occurred during the reign of his son, Jahangir. Akbar's artistic patronage was more broadly focused on architecture and comprehensive illustrated works.

1.  The largest known Harappan site is located in Gujarat, characterized by a unique water harnessing system and a large stadium.
2.  Chanhudaro, a Harappan site in present-day Pakistan, is notable for its absence of a citadel and the presence of a bead-making factory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dholavira in Gujarat is a significant Harappan site with a unique water management system and a structure interpreted as a stadium, Rakhigarhi in Haryana is considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Dholavira's features are correctly described, but its claim to being the largest is false.

Statement 2 is correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, is indeed distinctive for lacking a citadel, a prominent feature in other major Harappan cities. The discovery of a bead-making factory at Chanhudaro highlights the sophisticated craft production within the civilization.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the size of Dholavira or the unique characteristics of Chanhudaro.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Mahayana Buddhism:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal – the aspiration to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings, delaying one's own Nirvana to assist others. This contrasts with the Theravada focus on individual enlightenment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Image worship and elaborate rituals are characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism, which generally emphasizes a simpler, more monastic approach to practice. Theravada Buddhism is not strictly iconoclastic, although the emphasis on images is significantly less pronounced than in Mahayana.  The statement incorrectly reverses the roles of these two schools regarding image worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana mandapas are indeed a notable feature of temple architecture, their prominent use is associated with the Vijayanagara style, not specifically the Chalukyas.  The statement incorrectly attributes the architectural feature to the Chalukyas.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Saint Nimbarka was a significant Bhakti saint, his period predates Akbar's reign by a considerable margin. The statement wrongly places them as contemporaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's influence was primarily felt later in the Bhakti movement.  Kabir's teachings, which predate Sirhindi's life, were shaped by a syncretic blend of Hindu and Sufi thought, but not significantly by Sirhindi's specific ideas. The statement incorrectly links Kabir with a later figure.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rakhigarhi, situated in Haryana, is considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeological findings include granaries, a cemetery, drainage systems, and terracotta bricks, indicative of a well-organized urban settlement.  The scale and complexity of Rakhigarhi suggest it may have served as a provincial capital within the Harappan empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. Chanhudaro, located in present-day Pakistan, stands out among other Harappan sites for its absence of a citadel, a prominent feature in many other urban centers of the civilization.  The discovery of a bead-making factory at Chanhudaro highlights the sophisticated craftsmanship and specialized industries that flourished within the Harappan Civilization.  The lack of a citadel might indicate a different administrative or social structure compared to other major Harappan cities.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu.
2. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh, is a representation of Vishnu's boar incarnation rescuing the earth goddess.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

This chronological difference reflects the evolution of rock-cut architecture in India over several centuries.  The Dhauli elephant showcases early Mauryan artistic styles, while Mahabalipuram exemplifies the more developed Pallava sculptural traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Varaha image at the Udayagiri Caves is a well-known example of early Indian sculpture, depicting Vishnu's boar avatar (Varaha) in the act of rescuing Bhudevi (earth goddess) from the primordial waters. This iconic representation is characteristic of early Hindu iconography and reflects the religious beliefs and artistic sensibilities of the Gupta period (5th century CE). The Udayagiri caves themselves are significant for their cave temples and sculptures, representing an important phase in Indian rock-cut architecture.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The construction of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) was a distinctive feature of temple architecture in the Vijayanagara kingdom.
2. The Virupaksha Temple, a significant structure from the Vijayanagara period, is located in Hampi, Karnataka.

**4. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Jahangir shifted the emphasis in Mughal art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.
2.  Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in Akbar's court, composed dhrupads solely on Hindu deities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Akbar's reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, Jahangir's patronage notably shifted the focus towards individual portraits and the creation of albums.  Jahangir's personal interest in painting, and his own artistic skills, played a significant role in this transition.  This shift represents a change in artistic focus within the Mughal court, reflecting a greater emphasis on individual representation and the development of a distinct style of portraiture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mian Tansen was indeed a renowned musician in Akbar's court, and he did compose dhrupads, his compositions were not solely focused on Hindu deities.  His musical repertoire encompassed a broader range of themes, including compositions dedicated to his patrons and other subjects, reflecting the eclectic nature of the Mughal court and its patronage of diverse artistic expressions.


**5. With reference to Indian painting schools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kishangarh school of painting is renowned for its romantic depictions, particularly the iconic portrayal of Bani Thani.
2.  The Kangra school of painting, which flourished after the decline of the Mughal empire, is characterized by its use of vibrant primary colors and expressive faces with receding hairlines.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kishangarh school of painting, particularly associated with the works of Nihal Chand, is celebrated for its romantic and lyrical style, epitomized by the iconic image of Bani Thani.  This style, characterized by a unique aesthetic sensibility, stands apart from other Rajput painting schools. The romantic themes and the distinctive features of Bani Thani's portrayal have made the Kishangarh school a significant contributor to the broader landscape of Rajput painting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The description of vibrant primary colors and expressive faces with receding hairlines is more characteristic of the Basholi school, an early Pahari school of painting.  While the Kangra school, a later Pahari school, was known for its refined and delicate style, its palette was often softer and more nuanced compared to the bold colors employed by the Basholi painters.  The Kangra style emphasized lyrical and emotive representations, often based on literary and mythological themes.


**6. With reference to Indian classical dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is characterized by its emphasis on both Tandava (masculine, vigorous) and Lasya (feminine, graceful) aspects of dance.
2.  Mohiniyattam, primarily a solo dance form from Kerala, prominently features the Tribhanga posture, a three-bend posture of the body.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bharatanatyam, one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, is indeed known for its balanced emphasis on both Tandava and Lasya. This combination creates a dynamic and expressive style, encompassing both powerful and delicate movements. The intricate hand gestures (mudras), rhythmic footwork, and expressive facial movements all contribute to the rich and multifaceted nature of Bharatanatyam.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Tribhanga posture, a characteristic three-bend posture of the body, is more strongly associated with Odissi, a classical dance form from Odisha.  While Mohiniyattam, a graceful and elegant dance form from Kerala, has its own distinct set of postures and movements, the Tribhanga is not a defining feature of its style.  Mohiniyattam is known for its fluid movements, gentle footwork, and lyrical expressions.


**7. With reference to Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The seven swaras (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) in Hindustani classical music represent the seven basic notes of the musical scale.
2.  The concept of “Raga” in Indian classical music refers solely to the melodic structure, independent of the rhythmic structure (Tala).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The seven swaras (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) form the fundamental notes of the Hindustani classical music system.  These notes, arranged in various combinations and sequences, form the basis of the vast repertoire of ragas.  Understanding the swaras and their relationships is crucial to comprehending the melodic structures of Hindustani music.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While "Raga" primarily defines the melodic framework of a musical composition, it is not independent of the rhythmic structure ("Tala").  Ragas and Talas are intrinsically linked; a specific raga is often associated with particular talas, and the interplay between melody and rhythm is essential to the aesthetic experience of Indian classical music. The choice of Tala significantly impacts the expression and mood of the Raga.


**8. With reference to Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Sthanakvasi" sect is a branch of Jainism that emphasizes the importance of standing while performing religious rituals.
2.  The three jewels (Triratna) of Jainism are Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sthanakvasi sect is a prominent branch within Jainism.  The name "Sthanakvasi" literally means "one who sits in a place," but it refers to the practice of standing during religious rituals, particularly during the performance of prayers and the recitation of scriptures.  This emphasis on standing reflects a specific interpretation of Jain principles related to respect, mindfulness, and physical posture during worship.

Statement 2 is also correct. The three jewels (Triratna) – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – are fundamental principles in Jainism.  These principles guide the path to spiritual liberation (moksha) and represent the core tenets of Jain philosophy and practice.  Right Faith involves believing in the principles of Jainism; Right Knowledge involves understanding these principles through self-reflection and study; and Right Conduct involves adhering to ethical principles in all aspects of life.


**9. With reference to Buddhist Philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sautrantika and Sammitiya were significant schools of thought within early Buddhism.
2.  The Madhyamaka school, associated with Nagarjuna, is characterized by its emphasis on the concept of Sunyata (emptiness).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sautrantika and Sammitiya were indeed important schools of thought within early Buddhism. These schools represent different interpretations of Buddhist doctrines, particularly concerning the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.  Understanding these schools is crucial to grasping the diversity of thought within early Buddhism.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, is a significant Mahayana Buddhist school of thought.  The central concept of Madhyamaka is Sunyata, often translated as "emptiness," which refers to the lack of inherent self or independent existence in all phenomena.  Nagarjuna's sophisticated philosophical arguments regarding Sunyata have significantly influenced Buddhist thought for centuries.


**10. With reference to the Bengal School of Art, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abanindranath Tagore, a prominent figure of the Bengal School, is known for his paintings that drew inspiration from Indian miniature painting styles and emphasized spirituality.
2.  Raja Ravi Varma, a renowned painter from Kerala, was a key figure in the development of the Bengal School of Art.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abanindranath Tagore played a pivotal role in establishing and shaping the Bengal School of Art. He advocated for a revival of Indian artistic traditions, drawing inspiration from Indian miniature paintings and incorporating spiritual and philosophical themes into his works. His approach marked a departure from Western academic styles and helped establish a distinctly Indian artistic identity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Raja Ravi Varma, while a highly influential and celebrated painter in his own right, was not associated with the Bengal School of Art.  His style, though drawing from Indian traditions, developed independently and differed significantly from the artistic philosophy and techniques championed by the Bengal School.  The Bengal School was primarily a movement based in Bengal (now West Bengal and Bangladesh) and had its own distinct group of artists and aesthetic principles.


**1. With reference to the arrival of Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival directly led to the widespread adoption of gunpowder technology across the Indian subcontinent, revolutionizing warfare.
2.  The introduction of the arch and dome in Indian architecture is solely attributable to Babur's architectural patronage and influence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While Babur's arrival marked a significant turning point in Indian history, attributing the widespread adoption of gunpowder and the introduction of the arch and dome *solely* to him is inaccurate.  Gunpowder technology, though significantly advanced by the Mughals, had already existed in India before Babur's arrival, albeit in less sophisticated forms. Similarly, the arch and dome were architectural features present in Indian architecture long before the Mughal period, evident in pre-existing structures across various regions.  Babur's influence undoubtedly impacted the development and refinement of both gunpowder weaponry and architectural styles, but the statements oversimplify a complex historical evolution.  The Timurid architectural style, featuring arches and domes, did gain prominence under Babur, but it wasn't a completely novel introduction to the region.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the historical reality.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and archaeological history, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar is chronologically older than the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is significantly older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which was constructed during the Kalinga dynasty (11th-13th century CE).  The chronological order is reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves belongs to the Gupta period (5th century CE), while the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram were created by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th-8th century CE.  Therefore, the Varaha image is indeed earlier. The Gupta period's artistic achievements were influential, but the Pallava era brought its own distinct artistic style and innovations.


**3. With reference to places of pilgrimage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills, while Srisailam is located in the Nallamala Hills.
2. Pushkar is correctly paired with the Aravalli Hills.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Omkareshwar, a significant Shiva temple, is located on an island in the Narmada River, within the Satmala Hills in Madhya Pradesh. Srisailam, a major pilgrimage site dedicated to Shiva and other deities, is situated in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  Both pairings are geographically accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Pushkar is associated with the Aravalli range, it's not precisely *in* the hills but located in the plains at the base of the Aravalli range in Rajasthan.  The statement implies a more direct, hilltop location than is accurate. The location is in the Thar Desert region.


**4. With reference to Buddhist shrines in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in Ladakh.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is actually located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, a significant region for Tibetan Buddhism.  The Zanskar Valley is in a different part of Ladakh.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alchi Temple Complex, known for its unique blend of architectural styles and exquisite murals, is indeed located in Ladakh, a region rich in Buddhist heritage. The temples demonstrate the influence of both Indian and Tibetan Buddhist art.


**5. With reference to the term "Panchayatan" in Indian cultural history, consider the following statements:**

1. Panchayatan refers to a specific type of temple architecture characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.
2. Panchayatan is primarily associated with the administrative structure of ancient Indian villages.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan is a well-established term in the context of temple architecture, specifically referring to a style where a central shrine is flanked by four smaller shrines, often arranged symmetrically.  This architectural pattern is prevalent in various parts of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While village councils (panchayats) played a vital role in ancient Indian society, the term "Panchayatan" doesn't refer to this administrative structure.  The term is exclusively related to temple architecture and its design.


**6. With reference to Indian sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. Ajanta Caves are renowned for a grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, featuring celestial musicians and sorrowful followers.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta caves are indeed famous for their remarkable sculptures, including a large depiction of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, which vividly portrays celestial beings and the grieving figures of his disciples.  This sculpture is a masterpiece of Buddhist art.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Varaha avatar sculptures exist, the specific large-scale sculpture described is located at Udayagiri Caves in Madhya Pradesh, not Mount Abu. Mount Abu is known for its Dilwara Jain Temples.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as a private prayer chamber for Akbar.
2.  Akbar employed the Ibadat Khana as a venue for religious discussions with scholars from various faiths.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar certainly used the Ibadat Khana for personal reflection and prayer, its primary function was not solely as a private chamber.  Its design and purpose were more inclusive.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar famously utilized the Ibadat Khana as a platform for engaging in theological debates and discussions with scholars representing diverse religious traditions, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. This reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and intellectual curiosity.


**8. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, a Chaitya is indeed a prayer hall or place of worship, typically containing a stupa, while a Vihara served as a monastery or residence for monks.  These terms represent distinct functions within the cave complexes.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that Chaityas often contain stupas, but it's not universally true that the stupa is always at the far end and the Vihara the axial hall. The arrangement varied across different cave complexes.  The description is overly specific and not applicable to all Chaityas.


**12. With reference to the Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles, consider the following statements:**

1. These three styles represent the main racial groups of the Indian subcontinent.
2. These three styles represent the main styles of Indian temple architecture.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited sophisticated urban planning, including a grid-like road system and advanced drainage systems.
2.  Evidence suggests the Harappans engaged in extensive maritime trade, with connections to Mesopotamia and other regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, is renowned for its urban planning.  Archaeological excavations at sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkably well-organized city layout with grid patterns, standardized brick sizes, and sophisticated drainage systems. This demonstrates a high level of engineering and civic planning far surpassing contemporary civilizations.  Furthermore, the discovery of dockyards at Lothal and the presence of various imported goods indicate extensive trade networks reaching Mesopotamia, the Middle East, and potentially beyond.  The presence of standardized weights and measures further supports the existence of a robust and organized trade system.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Harappan civilization.


**2. With reference to the Mauryan Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ashoka's pillars served primarily as markers of imperial power and were not used for disseminating religious or moral messages.
2.  The famous "Lion Capital" at Sarnath, which forms part of India's national emblem, is a representative example of Mauryan sculpture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ashoka's pillars undoubtedly marked imperial power and authority, their primary function extended to propagating his edicts which included messages promoting Buddhist principles of peace, non-violence, and dharma. These edicts are inscribed on the pillars and served as a means of communicating the emperor's policies and moral teachings to a wider populace.  Statement 2 is correct. The Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath is a masterpiece of Mauryan sculpture and a significant artifact representing the artistic achievements of the era. Its four lions, symbolizing power and authority, are depicted sitting back-to-back on an abacus that also features the depiction of a bull, horse, and elephant. The Lion Capital is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is prominently featured in the national emblem of India.


**3. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core principle of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to guide and help sentient beings achieve enlightenment. This emphasis on compassion and universal salvation distinguishes Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The deification of the Buddha and the practice of image worship are characteristic features of Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism generally emphasizes personal spiritual practice and attainment of Nirvana through individual effort, with a less prominent focus on devotional practices involving images or the deification of the Buddha.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chalukya temples are known for their impressive architecture and sculptural work, Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions, are not a defining characteristic of their style.  These structures are more prominently associated with Vijayanagara architecture. Statement 2 is correct. Vijayanagara temples are celebrated for their grandeur, intricate carvings, and the incorporation of various structures within their complexes, including Kalyana Mandapas. These wedding pavilions served as important spaces within the temple complex, reflecting the significance of royal patronage and societal norms.  The Vittala Temple at Hampi is a prime example of a Vijayanagara temple featuring a magnificent Kalyana Mandapa.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka's period is generally placed in the 12th-13th centuries, long before Akbar's reign (1556-1605). Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Kabir's teachings were influenced by both Hindu and Sufi traditions, there's no evidence suggesting a direct and significant influence from Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, who lived much later (1564-1624).  Kabir predates Sirhindi by a significant margin, and their philosophies, while sharing some common ground in their critique of orthodox religious practices, developed independently.


**6. With reference to the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Akbar greatly patronized the arts and oversaw the creation of magnificent illustrated manuscripts, the significant shift towards individual portraits and album art is more closely associated with the reign of his son, Jahangir.  Akbar's artistic focus remained largely on the grand scale, including architecture and large-scale illustrated works. Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir, a keen connoisseur of art and himself a painter, significantly fostered the development of individual portraiture and the album format. His reign saw a remarkable flowering of portrait painting in the Mughal school, with an emphasis on realistic depictions of individuals, including himself, his family, and members of his court. The detailed rendering of flora and fauna also became prominent during his reign.


**7. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant examples of early rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest surviving ones in India. The Barabar caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period, predate the Badami caves. Statement 2 is correct.  The Ellora caves are a remarkable testament to India's rich artistic and religious heritage.  These caves, carved out of a single rock face, contain temples and shrines representing Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, demonstrating the coexistence and interaction of different religious beliefs in ancient India.  The Kailasa Temple, a monolithic rock-cut temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a particularly renowned example from the Ellora caves.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indus Valley Civilization displayed sophisticated urban planning and impressive engineering feats, evidence of large palaces or grand temples is limited.  The structures found are more likely public buildings or large residential complexes, but not comparable to the monumental architecture of later civilizations.  The nature of the social hierarchy remains a subject of ongoing debate among scholars. Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings, particularly the discovery of various figurines and seals, suggest the Indus people worshipped both male and female deities.  The "Mother Goddess" figurines are particularly noteworthy and represent a prominent aspect of their religious beliefs. The evidence suggests a complex religious system with a variety of deities and rituals.



**9. With reference to the Thanjavur school of painting, consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school's paintings are characterized by the extensive use of gold foil and vibrant colors.

This technique, combined with the use of vibrant colors and intricate details, creates a rich and visually striking aesthetic. Statement 2 is also correct. The Maratha rulers played a significant role in the patronage and development of the Thanjavur school.  Their support enabled the school to flourish and produce many exquisite works of art, contributing to its unique stylistic features and lasting legacy.  The school continued to thrive even after the decline of Maratha power.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Raja Ravi Varma, a highly influential figure in the development of modern Indian art, hailed from Kerala, not Maharashtra. His paintings, combining traditional Indian themes with European academic techniques, had a profound impact on Indian art. Statement 2 is correct. The Bengal School of Art, a significant movement in early 20th-century Indian art, was heavily influenced by the artistic vision and leadership of Abanindranath Tagore. Rabindranath Tagore, while not primarily a painter, also contributed to the school's philosophical and aesthetic underpinnings, fostering its nationalist and spiritual ideals.

Kanishka's reign saw the issuance of a large number of coins, primarily in gold, showcasing the Kushana empire's wealth and power. His coins are significant for their artistic style and the information they provide about the empire's history and religious beliefs.  While he did issue other metals, gold was dominant.

1. Lothal, an Indus Valley Civilization site, served as a major port for exporting goods like copper, hardwoods, and ivory.
2. Muziris, a port on the Malabar Coast, is mentioned in ancient Greek texts as a significant trading center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lothal, located in present-day Gujarat, is considered one of the most important ports of the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeological findings suggest that it served as a major center for maritime trade, exporting various goods to Mesopotamia and other regions.  The discovery of a dockyard at Lothal further strengthens its importance as a port city. Statement 2 is also correct. Muziris, located on the Malabar Coast in present-day Kerala, is mentioned in ancient Greek and Roman texts like the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as a major trading center.  It served as a crucial link in the trade routes connecting India with the Roman Empire and other regions, facilitating the exchange of spices, textiles, and other valuable commodities.


**13. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ashoka's efforts to spread Buddhism were primarily confined to the Indian subcontinent.
2.  Ancient Indian traders played a significant role in disseminating Indian cultural influences to Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ashoka's impact was felt throughout India, his missionary efforts extended beyond the subcontinent, notably to Sri Lanka, where his son and daughter played key roles in establishing Buddhism.  His edicts also influenced the development of Buddhist traditions in other parts of Asia. Statement 2 is correct.  Ancient Indian traders, particularly during the period of flourishing maritime trade, played a crucial role in disseminating Indian cultural influences to Southeast Asia.  The spread of Buddhism, Hinduism, and other aspects of Indian culture was significantly facilitated by their interaction with local populations in Southeast Asia. The establishment of trading colonies and settlements contributed to the cultural exchange and the adoption of Indian ideas and practices.


**14.  With reference to ancient Indian mathematics, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of the Pythagorean theorem was first developed by Indian mathematicians.
2. Pingala's Chandashastra contains the earliest known description of the binary number system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Indian mathematicians made significant contributions to mathematics, including the concept of the Pythagorean theorem (Baudhayana Sulbasutra),  the theorem's discovery is generally credited to the ancient Greeks (Pythagoras). However, the independent discovery in India highlights the parallel development of mathematical knowledge in different parts of the world. Statement 2 is correct.  Pingala's Chandashastra, an ancient Sanskrit treatise on prosody, contains the earliest known description of the binary number system.  This remarkable achievement predates the formal development of the binary system in the West by centuries. Its application to prosody shows the advanced understanding of mathematical concepts in ancient India.


**15.  With reference to ancient Indian scripts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gurmukhi script is primarily used for writing the Punjabi language.
2.  The Modi script, once the official script for Marathi, is now largely replaced by the Devanagari script.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gurmukhi script is the primary script used for writing the Punjabi language, especially by the Sikh community.  It is a distinct script with its own unique characteristics and is an essential part of Sikh religious and cultural identity. Statement 2 is also correct. The Modi script served as the official script for writing the Marathi language for a considerable period. However, over time, the Devanagari script gained prominence and is now the predominantly used script for Marathi. Although Modi is still used in some contexts, its widespread use has been largely superseded by Devanagari.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest Harappan site, Rakhigarhi, is located in Gujarat and features a well-planned drainage system.
2.  Chanhudaro, a Harappan site in present-day Pakistan, is notable for its absence of a citadel.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rakhigarhi is indeed considered one of the largest Harappan sites,  it's located in Haryana, not Gujarat.  The statement correctly notes its advanced drainage system, a hallmark of Harappan urban planning.  The location error, however, makes the entire statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. Chanhudaro, situated in present-day Pakistan, is unique among Harappan sites for its lack of a prominent citadel, a fortified area typically found in other major cities of the civilization. This absence suggests a different social or political organization compared to other Harappan settlements.  The absence of a citadel at Chanhudaro, a significant finding, distinguishes it from other major Harappan sites.


**2. With reference to the Mauryan Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kanganahalli inscription features a stone portrait of Ashoka with the label "Ranyo Ashoka" written in Brahmi script.
2.  The Shahbazgarhi edicts are inscribed in Kharosthi script and date back to the 3rd century BCE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kanganahalli inscription in Karnataka is significant for its depiction of Ashoka, identified by the Brahmi inscription "Ranyo Ashoka." This inscription provides valuable visual and textual evidence related to the Mauryan emperor.  The presence of both a sculptural representation and a textual inscription makes Kanganahalli a crucial site for understanding Mauryan history.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Shahbazgarhi edicts, located in Pakistan, are indeed inscribed in the Kharosthi script, a script prevalent in northwestern India during the Mauryan period. Their dating to the 3rd century BCE aligns with the timeframe of Ashoka's reign, further confirming their authenticity and historical significance. The use of Kharosthi at Shahbazgarhi contrasts with the Brahmi script used in other Ashokan edicts, reflecting the linguistic and geographical diversity of the empire.


**3. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the path of Bodhisattvas, but rejects the deification of the Buddha.
2. The practice of image worship and rituals is central to Mahayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others attain enlightenment.  However, it also significantly departs from Theravada Buddhism by accepting the deification of the Buddha, viewing him as a divine figure worthy of worship.  This difference in the understanding of the Buddha's nature is a key distinction between the two branches of Buddhism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mahayana Buddhism actively promotes image worship (iconography) and elaborate rituals as integral parts of its practice. These rituals and the veneration of Buddha images are aimed at fostering devotion and facilitating spiritual growth among its followers. The emphasis on image worship and ritual in Mahayana Buddhism contrasts with the more austere practices found in Theravada Buddhism.


**4. With reference to temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalyana Mandapas, prominent in Chandela temple architecture, are dedicated to celestial beings.
2.  Vijayanagara temples are characterized by the inclusion of Kalyana Mandapas, or wedding pavilions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chandela dynasty created magnificent temples known for their intricate carvings and grandeur, Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) are not their defining feature.  The association of Kalyana Mandapas with celestial beings is also inaccurate; they are primarily associated with marriage ceremonies and royal patronage.  The attribution of Kalyana Mandapas to Chandela architecture is a misdirection.

Statement 2 is correct.  Vijayanagara temples are indeed renowned for their incorporation of Kalyana Mandapas, large structures within the temple complex dedicated to wedding ceremonies. These pavilions reflect the importance given to royal rituals and the integration of religious and secular life within the Vijayanagara kingdom.  The presence of Kalyana Mandapas in Vijayanagara temples is a well-documented aspect of their architectural style.


**5. With reference to medieval Indian saints, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Nimbarka, a contemporary of Akbar, is associated with the Vaishnava tradition.
2. Saint Kabir's philosophy was significantly influenced by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Saint Nimbarka was indeed a prominent Vaishnava saint, he predates Akbar by several centuries.  His teachings and influence significantly predate the Mughal era, placing him firmly in a different historical context. The assertion of Nimbarka being a contemporary of Akbar is a chronological error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Saint Kabir, known for his syncretic philosophy blending elements of Hinduism and Islam, lived and died before Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's birth.  Therefore, any significant influence from Sirhindi on Kabir's thought is historically impossible. The temporal discrepancy between Kabir and Sirhindi invalidates the claim of influence.



**6. With reference to Mian Tansen, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mian Tansen was the title conferred upon him by Emperor Akbar.
2.  Tansen's compositions primarily focused on the themes of Sufi mysticism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  "Mian" was indeed a title bestowed upon Tansen by Emperor Akbar, reflecting the high regard in which he was held at the Mughal court. The title underscores Tansen's eminence as a musician and his position within Akbar's court.  The title, therefore, accurately reflects his status and patronage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tansen was a highly skilled and versatile musician, his compositions were not primarily focused on Sufi mysticism.  His work drew heavily from Hindu devotional traditions, incorporating themes and styles associated with Hindu deities and mythology.  The assertion that his work primarily focused on Sufi themes is a misrepresentation of his musical oeuvre.


**7. With reference to Mughal imperial patronage of art, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Humayun shifted the focus from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.
2.  Emperor Jahangir is known for his patronage of individual portraits emphasizing flora and fauna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Humayun was a patron of art and did commission some illuminated manuscripts, the significant shift toward individual portraits and albums as the primary focus of imperial patronage occurred later, during the reign of Jahangir.  The attribution of this shift to Humayun is an anachronism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Emperor Jahangir, himself a keen painter and connoisseur of art, is widely recognized for his patronage of individual portraits, often featuring detailed depictions of flora and fauna.  This emphasis on natural elements and individual representation is a distinctive feature of his reign's artistic output.  Jahangir's personal interest in art and his patronage directly led to the flourishing of portraiture.


**8. With reference to Kashmiri literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lal Ded, a 12th-century poetess, is associated with the Shaivite tradition.
2.  Noor Din (Nund Rishi) is credited with integrating Hindi and Islamic elements in his poetry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lal Ded, a prominent female poet from Kashmir, is indeed associated with the Shaivite tradition. Her poetry reflects Shaivite mystical beliefs and experiences, making her a significant figure in the history of Kashmiri Shaivism.  Her contribution is especially notable given the relative scarcity of female voices in medieval literature.

Statement 2 is also correct. Noor Din, better known as Nund Rishi, played a crucial role in blending Hindi and Islamic elements within Kashmiri poetry. His work demonstrates a remarkable synthesis of different cultural and religious traditions, showcasing the syncretic nature of Kashmiri culture.  His contribution showcases the intermingling of religious and linguistic traditions in Kashmir.


**9. With reference to Punjabi literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Adi Granth, primarily written in Persian script, includes works by Kabir and Nanak.
2.  Waris Shah is renowned for his composition of the epic Heer-Ranjha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Adi Granth, a foundational text of Sikhism, is primarily written in the Gurmukhi script, not Persian. While it does include compositions by Kabir and Nanak, the script used is Gurmukhi, reflecting the development of a distinct Sikh literary tradition.  The error in identifying the script is a significant factual inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. Waris Shah is indeed celebrated for his authorship of Heer-Ranjha, a well-known Punjabi epic love story.  His work is considered a masterpiece of Punjabi literature, showcasing the lyrical beauty and emotional depth of the Punjabi language.  The association of Waris Shah with Heer-Ranjha is a well-established fact.


**10. With reference to Marathi Literature, consider the following statements:**

1. Jnaneshwar's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, written in the 13th century, is considered the oldest surviving work in Marathi.
2. Eknath, a 16th-century saint, is known for his commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana and Ramayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jnaneshwar's Dnyaneshwari, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, is widely regarded as one of the earliest surviving works in Marathi.  His work played a pivotal role in shaping Marathi literature and religious discourse.  The significance of Dnyaneshwari in the development of Marathi literature is well-established.

Statement 2 is also correct. Eknath, a prominent 16th-century Marathi saint, is famous for his commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana and Ramayana. His works contributed significantly to the Bhakti movement in Maharashtra and continue to be studied and revered.  Eknath's commentaries are important contributions to Marathi religious literature.


**11. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily flourished in South India during the 12th-14th centuries.
2.  Alvars were a group of twelve saint-poets associated with Vaishnavism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement had a significant presence in South India, its influence was not restricted to that region. The movement spread across various parts of India, including North India, with different regional expressions and variations.  The statement's limitation of the movement's geographic reach is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alvars were indeed a group of twelve saint-poets who played a crucial role in propagating Vaishnavism in South India. Their devotional poetry, characterized by intense emotional expression and lyrical beauty, deeply impacted Tamil religious literature and culture.  The Alvars' contribution to Vaishnava bhakti is well-documented.


**12. With reference to the Sufi movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chishti order, founded by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, is known for its emphasis on Wahadat al-wujud.
2.  The Naqshbandi order, associated with Ahmad Sirhindi, gained prominence during Akbar's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chishti order, established by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, is indeed known for its emphasis on Wahadat al-wujud (the unity of being), a mystical concept emphasizing the oneness of God and creation. This doctrine significantly influenced the Chishti order's approach to religious practice and social interaction.  The Chishti order's association with Wahadat al-wujud is a defining characteristic.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Naqshbandi order, associated with the influential figure of Ahmad Sirhindi, did gain significant prominence during the reign of Akbar.  Sirhindi's teachings and the order's emphasis on strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy resonated with certain segments of the population during that period.  The rise of the Naqshbandi order during Akbar's reign is a well-established historical fact.


**13.  With reference to Sangam literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tolkappiyam, a textbook on Tamil grammar, was compiled during the first Sangam.
2.  The third Sangam is considered largely legendary and mythical by many scholars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Tolkappiyam is a significant work on Tamil grammar, its compilation is generally associated with the second Sangam, not the first. The first Sangam's existence is largely considered mythical, with no surviving literary works attributed to it.  The temporal placement of Tolkappiyam is a crucial point of distinction.

Statement 2 is correct. The first two Sangams are often considered largely legendary and mythical by many scholars, with limited or no verifiable historical evidence to support their existence. It is the third Sangam that is considered to have a more solid basis in historical reality, although details remain debated. The legendary status of the early Sangams is a widely accepted scholarly view.

His contributions to the development of Hindi prose, drama, and journalism were instrumental in shaping modern Hindi literary traditions. His influence on subsequent generations of Hindi writers is undeniable.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Dwivedi Yug (1893-1918) chronologically precedes the Chhayavad movement (1918-1937) in Hindi literature.  The Dwivedi Yug is characterized by its focus on reforming Hindi language and literature, laying the groundwork for the later romanticism and idealism of the Chhayavad movement. The chronological order of these literary movements is a key element in understanding the evolution of Hindi literature.



**1. With reference to Indian classical dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kathak, originating in North India, emphasizes intricate footwork and rhythmic patterns, often incorporating storytelling elements through expressive hand gestures (abhinaya).
2.  Odissi, a dance form from Odisha, is characterized by its graceful and fluid movements, often depicting themes from Hindu mythology and employing a distinct "tribhanga" posture.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of Kathak and Odissi. Kathak, indeed, originates in North India and is renowned for its complex footwork, rhythmic precision (tala), and the use of abhinaya to narrate stories or express emotions.  Its evolution is closely tied to the oral tradition of storytelling and musical accompaniment.  Odissi, hailing from Odisha, is equally distinctive, known for its elegant and flowing movements, often portraying narratives from Hindu mythology, particularly those related to Lord Jagannath. The "tribhanga" posture, a three-bend stance, is a hallmark of Odissi's aesthetic.  Therefore, both statements reflect established characteristics of these two prominent classical dance forms, making (c) the correct answer.


**2. Consider the following statements about Indian folk dances:**

1.  Bhangra, a vibrant folk dance primarily associated with Punjab, is characterized by its energetic movements and the use of dhol (a double-sided barrel drum) as a primary percussion instrument.
2.  Garba, a traditional folk dance of Gujarat, involves circular movements around a lamp (garbha deep), often performed during the Navratri festival and embodying themes of devotion and celebration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify the key characteristics of Bhangra and Garba. Bhangra, strongly associated with the Punjabi culture, is known for its high-energy and spirited movements, often performed during harvest festivals or other celebrations. The dhol plays a crucial role in providing the rhythmic pulse of the dance. Garba, originating in Gujarat, is a distinctive dance form characterized by its circular movements around a lit earthen lamp, a symbol of the divine feminine.  It is a significant part of Navratri celebrations and often reflects themes of devotion and community bonding. Thus, (c) is the correct option because both descriptions are accurate representations of these two important folk dance traditions.


**3. With reference to the evolution of Indian theatre, consider the following statements:**

1.  Koodiyattam, a traditional theatre form from Kerala, strictly adheres to the principles outlined in Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra, employing Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Malayalam languages.
2.  Ankia Naat, a one-act play form from Assam, was pioneered by the Vaishnava saint Sankaradeva and his disciple Madhavdev, often depicting scenes from the life of Lord Krishna.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical and stylistic features of Koodiyattam and Ankia Naat. Koodiyattam, originating in Kerala, is indeed a living testament to the Natya Shastra's principles, employing a unique blend of Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Malayalam in its performances.  It represents a continuous theatrical tradition dating back centuries. Ankia Naat, developed in Assam by the influential Vaishnava saint Sankaradeva and his disciple Madhavdev, is a distinct one-act play form frequently portraying episodes from the life of Lord Krishna.  Therefore, both descriptions are correct, making (c) the appropriate choice.


**4. With reference to Indian musical instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *sitar*, a plucked string instrument primarily used in Hindustani classical music, is known for its distinctive drone strings and fretted fingerboard, allowing for intricate melodic ornamentation.
2.  The *veena*, a plucked string instrument often used in Carnatic classical music, comes in various forms, including the *gottuvadyam* and *mridangam*, and is known for its rich tonal quality and melodic capabilities.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the *sitar*.  It is a prominent plucked string instrument in Hindustani classical music, characterized by its distinctive drone strings (which provide a continuous harmonic background) and its fretted fingerboard that allows for complex melodic embellishments and microtonal variations.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the *veena* is indeed a plucked string instrument used in Carnatic music, and it does exist in various forms, the *gottuvadyam* is a type of *veena*, but the *mridangam* is a percussion instrument, not a stringed instrument. This makes the statement inaccurate.  The *veena* is known for its melodic capabilities and rich resonance, but the inclusion of the *mridangam* as a type of *veena* is factually incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about Indian musical traditions:**

1.  Hindustani classical music, predominantly associated with North India, emphasizes improvisation and the use of *ragas* (melodic frameworks) and *talas* (rhythmic cycles), often incorporating elements from Persian and Arabic musical traditions.
2.  Carnatic classical music, primarily prevalent in South India, features a more structured approach to composition, with a focus on *ragas* and *talas*, but with less emphasis on improvisation compared to Hindustani music.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately differentiate between the core characteristics of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music. Hindustani music, primarily found in North India, is indeed known for its improvisational nature, the significant role of *ragas* and *talas*, and the influence of Persian and Arabic musical elements which were absorbed over centuries of cultural exchange.  Carnatic music, central to South India, is characterized by a more structured approach to composition, placing equal importance on *ragas* and *talas*, but generally with a comparatively less extensive scope for improvisation within a performance than its Hindustani counterpart.  The emphasis on structured compositions doesn't negate the importance of melodic improvisation or rhythmic variation within the Carnatic system but rather highlights a different stylistic emphasis.  Therefore, both statements offer valid comparisons of these two distinct yet related musical traditions.


**6. With reference to Indian painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal school of painting, flourishing under the Mughal Empire, is characterized by its realistic depictions, detailed miniature paintings, and use of vibrant colours, often portraying courtly life, portraits, and natural scenes.
2. The Rajput school of painting, patronized by Rajput rulers, showcases a blend of religious, romantic, and heroic themes, emphasizing expressive brushstrokes and a more lyrical style compared to the Mughal school.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the defining characteristics of the Mughal and Rajput schools of painting. The Mughal school, developed during the Mughal Empire's reign, is indeed known for its meticulous realism, detailed miniature paintings, and the use of rich, vibrant colours, often depicting scenes of courtly life, royal portraits, and depictions of nature.  The Rajput school, supported by Rajput kings, is distinguished by its blend of religious, romantic, and heroic themes, employing a more expressive and lyrical style with a greater emphasis on emotional intensity than the often more formal Mughal style.  The contrast between the two schools highlights the diversity within Indian painting traditions. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**7. With reference to the development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta Caves, famous for their exquisite murals, depict scenes from the Jataka tales and Buddhist mythology, showcasing the mastery of the artists in capturing movement, emotion, and narrative flow.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the artistic significance of the Ajanta and Ellora caves. The Ajanta caves are indeed celebrated for their breathtaking murals, which vividly depict scenes from the Jataka tales (stories about the previous lives of the Buddha) and Buddhist mythology.  These murals demonstrate remarkable skill in conveying narratives, emotions, and a sense of movement. The Ellora caves are equally remarkable for their rock-cut architecture and sculptures, which uniquely blend Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain artistic styles within a single complex, signifying the religious coexistence and the creative fusion of different artistic traditions of the time. Thus, both statements accurately represent the historical and artistic importance of these two sites.


**8. Consider the following statements about Indian handicrafts:**

1.  Bandhani, a tie-and-dye technique, is primarily associated with Rajasthan and Gujarat, creating intricate patterns through the precise tying and dyeing of fabric, resulting in a variety of visually appealing designs.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the characteristics of Bandhani and Kalamkari. Bandhani, a prominent tie-and-dye technique, is indeed strongly associated with Rajasthan and Gujarat, where skilled artisans create intricate patterns by meticulously tying and dyeing the fabric. The resulting designs are known for their visual appeal and cultural significance. Kalamkari, a hand-painting technique using natural dyes, is primarily practiced in Andhra Pradesh.  Artisans create elaborate and vibrant designs on cloth, often incorporating themes from mythology, nature, or folklore. The use of natural dyes adds to the unique quality and rich colours of Kalamkari textiles.  Therefore, both descriptions accurately capture the essence of these two important Indian textile art forms.


**9. With reference to the Indian musical system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The seven *swaras* (notes) in Indian music – Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni – form the basis of melodic structures, and their arrangement and emphasis define the character of different *ragas*.
2.  *Talas* (rhythmic cycles) in Indian music are independent of the melodic framework (*raga*) and provide a structured rhythmic framework for musical compositions, with various *talas* having different numbers of beats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly explain fundamental aspects of the Indian musical system.  The seven *swaras* (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) are indeed the foundational notes upon which melodies are constructed in Indian classical music. The specific arrangement, sequence, and emphasis given to these *swaras* within a composition determine the unique character and mood of a particular *raga*.  *Talas*, the rhythmic cycles, function independently of the melodic framework (*raga*). They provide the rhythmic structure for musical compositions, with different *talas* having varying numbers of beats and subdivisions, creating diverse rhythmic patterns. Therefore, both statements accurately describe key elements of the Indian musical structure.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding Indian art and architecture:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization is known for its sophisticated urban planning, evident in the grid-like layouts of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, along with advanced drainage systems and standardized brick sizes.
2.  The Gupta period witnessed a flourishing of art and architecture, characterized by the development of the Nagara style of temple architecture and the emergence of the classic style of sculpture, often depicting deities and royal figures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements highlight significant aspects of Harappan urban planning and Gupta-era artistic achievements. The Harappan Civilization, indeed, exhibited remarkable urban planning skills, as evidenced by the well-organized grid patterns of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, efficient drainage systems, and the use of standardized bricks, showcasing a high degree of engineering and societal organization. The Gupta period (circa 320-550 CE) is widely recognized as a golden age for Indian art and architecture.  This era saw the development of the Nagara style of temple architecture, characterized by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), and the emergence of a classical style of sculpture that realistically depicted deities, royal figures, and other subjects, reflecting a high level of artistic refinement.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key features of these historical periods.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Hitopadesha*, known for its non-human and animal characters imparting wisdom, was authored by Narayan Pandit.
2.  The Upa-Puranas, a subgenre of Puranas, are categorized into five major subjects as defined by the Gupta period lexicographer, Amarasimha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of classical Sanskrit literature.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Narayan Pandit as the author of the *Hitopadesha*, a well-known collection of fables employing animal characters to convey moral lessons.  This aligns with the text's description of the genre and its didactic purpose.  Statement 2 is also accurate; the Upa-Puranas, or minor Puranas, are indeed categorized according to the five major subjects outlined by Amarasimha, a significant Sanskrit lexicographer of the Gupta period. These categories – Sarga (creation), Pratisarga (recreation cycles), Manvantara (Manu's lifespans), Vamsa (genealogies), and Vanshanucharita (dynastic histories) – provide a structured framework for understanding the content and themes of these texts.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to Classical Sanskrit Literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The epics *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana* are classified under Classical Sanskrit Literature but are discussed separately due to their religious significance.
2.  Panini's *Ashtadhyayi* is a treatise on Sanskrit grammar, outlining the rules governing the language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Classical Sanskrit Literature. Statement 1 correctly notes the classification of the *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana* within the Classical Sanskrit category while highlighting their separate treatment due to their profound religious importance within Hinduism. Their influence on later Sanskrit Kavya (epic poetry) and Nataka (classical drama) is also acknowledged in the provided text, further supporting this statement.  Statement 2 is equally accurate; Panini's *Ashtadhyayi* is indeed a foundational text in Sanskrit linguistics, providing a comprehensive and systematic account of Sanskrit grammar. Its influence on the structure and rules of the language is widely recognized. Thus, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**3. With reference to Sanskrit Drama, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kalidasa's plays, including *Malavikagnimitra*, *Vikramorvasiya*, and *Abhigyana Shakuntalam*, are considered major works of ancient Sanskrit drama.
2.  Bharata's *Natyashastra* is a treatise solely dedicated to the rules of Sanskrit poetry, focusing on its metrical structure and stylistic elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the significance of Kalidasa's plays within the canon of ancient Sanskrit drama. *Malavikagnimitra*, *Vikramorvasiya*, and *Abhigyana Shakuntalam* are indeed widely studied and celebrated for their dramatic structure, character development, and poetic language.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Bharata's *Natyashastra* is a crucial text, it is not solely focused on Sanskrit poetry.  It is a comprehensive treatise on dramatic arts, encompassing aspects of acting, stagecraft, music, dance, and the overall theatrical production, not just poetry.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly affirm or deny the accuracy of both statements.


**4. With reference to Sanskrit Poetry (Kavya), consider the following statements:**

1. Kalidasa, a renowned Sanskrit poet, authored *Kumarasambhava*, *Raghuvamsa*, *Meghaduta*, and *Ritusamhara*.
2.  Harisena's poems praising Samudra Gupta's valour were inscribed on the Allahabad pillar, but he is better known for his contributions to Sanskrit prose.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately lists several key works of Kalidasa, a highly influential figure in Sanskrit literature. *Kumarasambhava* (Birth of Kartikeya), *Raghuvamsa* (Dynasty of Raghus), *Meghaduta* (Cloud Messenger), and *Ritusamhara* (Season's Garland) are all well-known and widely studied examples of his poetic mastery.  Statement 2, however, contains an inaccuracy. While Harisena's poems celebrating Samudra Gupta's achievements were indeed inscribed on the Allahabad pillar,  claiming he is "better known for his contributions to Sanskrit prose" is not supported by readily available historical accounts; his fame primarily rests on his poetic works. Therefore, only statement 1 is wholly correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies and incomplete nature of their assertions.


**5. With reference to Other Major Sanskrit Texts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Manusmriti* primarily focuses on military strategies and statecraft, offering guidance to rulers on governance and administration.
2.  Kautilya's *Arthashastra*, attributed to Chanakya, provides insights into the economic and social conditions of the Mauryan empire, including military strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *Manusmriti* (Laws of Manu) is not primarily concerned with military strategies and statecraft.  It is a foundational legal and social text in Hinduism, outlining principles of dharma (righteous conduct), social organization, and laws governing various aspects of life.  It does not focus on military strategies.  Statement 2 is correct. Kautilya's *Arthashastra* does indeed offer valuable insights into the Mauryan empire's economic, social, and political structures, including detailed discussions on military strategy and administration. The text's association with Chanakya, a key figure in the establishment of the Mauryan dynasty, is also well-established.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent or incompletely describe the content of the texts.


**6. With reference to Literature in Pali and Prakrit, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Jatakas*, a collection of stories from the previous lives of the Buddha, are primarily found in Sanskrit.
2.  The *Agamas*, important Jain canonical texts, are primarily written in Prakrit.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *Jatakas* are not primarily found in Sanskrit. While some versions exist in Sanskrit, they are more widely known and prevalent in Pali, the language of Theravada Buddhism.  The text mentions their availability in both languages, but emphasizes their importance within the Pali Buddhist canon. Statement 2 is correct. The *Agamas* are indeed the core canonical texts of Jainism, and they are largely written in Prakrit, specifically Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the languages of the *Jatakas* or incorrectly assess the accuracy of both statements.


**7.  With reference to Tamil Sangam Literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangam period, during which most of the Sangam literature was composed and compiled, is widely accepted to have spanned from 300 BCE to 300 CE.
2.  The *Tirukkural*, authored by Thiruvalluvar, is a significant contribution to Sangam literature, divided into three parts covering ethics, polity, and love.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate information regarding Tamil Sangam Literature. Statement 1 correctly identifies the generally accepted timeframe for the Sangam period (300 BCE to 300 CE), a significant era in Tamil literary history. While some debate exists regarding the precise dates and authenticity of some early Sangam works, the given timeframe is widely accepted. Statement 2 is also accurate. The *Tirukkural*, attributed to Thiruvalluvar, is indeed a highly regarded work within Sangam literature. Its tripartite structure encompassing ethics (Aram), polity (Porul), and love (Inbam) is well-known and reflects the breadth of its thematic scope.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**8. With reference to Medieval Literature in Persian, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a prominent Persian poet, authored *Padmavat*, a celebrated work of medieval Persian literature.
2.  Baburnama, Akbarnama, and Ain-i-Akbari are significant historical accounts written in Persian during the Mughal period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. *Padmavat* was not authored by Amir Khusrau.  It was written by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, a significant figure in Awadhi literature. Amir Khusrau was a renowned poet and writer, but his works are distinct from *Padmavat*. Statement 2 is accurate.  *Baburnama*, *Akbarnama*, and *Ain-i-Akbari* are indeed important historical texts composed in Persian during the Mughal period. *Baburnama* is Babur's autobiography, *Akbarnama* is a comprehensive history of Akbar's reign written by Abul Fazl, and *Ain-i-Akbari* is a detailed administrative and cultural record of Akbar's empire. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misattribution of authorship in statement 1.


**9. With reference to Medieval Hindi Literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tulsidas, known for his *Ramcharitmanas*, primarily wrote in Braj Bhasha, a dialect heavily influenced by Sanskrit.
2.  Surdas, a devotee of Lord Krishna, authored *Sur Sagar*, focusing on Krishna's childhood and adolescent years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Tulsidas did author the *Ramcharitmanas* and wrote in Braj Bhasha, saying it was "heavily influenced by Sanskrit" is an oversimplification.  While Sanskrit did influence Braj Bhasha, the dialect also incorporated elements of other languages, and Tulsidas's style is characterized by its accessibility and use of vernacular expressions. Statement 2 is correct.  Surdas, a renowned Bhakti poet, did indeed author *Sur Sagar*, a work dedicated to Lord Krishna's life, with a particular emphasis on his childhood and youth. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the oversimplification and inaccuracy in statement 1.


**10. With reference to the Sufi Movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chishti order, founded by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, emphasized strict asceticism and rejection of worldly possessions, similar to many Bhakti saints.
2.  Baba Farid, a prominent figure in the Chishti order, is known for his propagation of Sufism in the Punjab region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chishti order promoted spiritual growth and devotion, it didn't necessarily emphasize strict asceticism and complete rejection of worldly possessions in the same way as some Bhakti saints.  The Chishti Sufis often engaged with society and held influential positions. Statement 2 is correct. Baba Farid, a significant figure within the Chishti order, played a crucial role in spreading Sufi teachings and practices in the Punjab region.  His contributions to Punjabi Sufi poetry are well-known.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 concerning the Chishti order's approach to asceticism.



**1. With reference to early Buddhist schools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sthavira Nikaya, one of the two early schools, included sub-sects like Mahisasaka and Dharmaguptaka, while the Mahasamghika school comprised sub-sects such as Gokulika and Caitika.  
2.  The Hemavatika and Rajagiriya were sub-sects that emerged later, after the initial split between Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The early Buddhist Sangha is believed to have split into the Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika schools.  The provided list in the source material correctly identifies several sub-sects belonging to each of these primary schools.  The mention of Mahisasaka and Dharmaguptaka within Sthavira Nikaya and Gokulika and Caitika within Mahasamghika aligns with historical accounts of early Buddhist sectarian divisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source material explicitly lists Hemavatika and Rajagiriya as sub-sects *not* identified under the two main early schools (Sthavira Nikaya and Mahasamghika). This implies these schools emerged later in the development of Buddhism,  contradicting the statement's claim that they appeared immediately after the initial split.  The chronological development of Buddhist schools is a complex subject, and while precise dating is debated, the context strongly suggests Hemavatika and Rajagiriya are not considered among the earliest divisions.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, emphasizes the concept of Sunyata, asserting that all phenomena are devoid of inherent existence.
2. The Bodhisattva path, central to Mahayana, requires individuals to strive for individual enlightenment before assisting others.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Madhyamaka school, a significant branch of Mahayana Buddhism, is accurately described as being founded by Nagarjuna and centering on the Sunyata doctrine (emptiness).  This doctrine's core tenet, that phenomena lack inherent self-nature, is a cornerstone of Madhyamaka philosophy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bodhisattva path in Mahayana Buddhism directly contradicts the statement.  A Bodhisattva delays their own attainment of Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.  The emphasis is on universal liberation and compassion, not prioritizing individual salvation before assisting others. This is a fundamental distinction between Mahayana and Theravada approaches to enlightenment.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Jain philosophy:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core Jain principle, posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, thus rejecting the possibility of a single absolute truth.
2.  The five restraints (ahimsa, satya, asteya, aparigraha, and brahmacharya) were all initially propounded by Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly explains Anekantavada, a central tenet of Jainism.  It highlights the philosophy's rejection of a singular, absolute truth in favor of acknowledging the complexity and multi-faceted nature of reality.  This concept is crucial to understanding Jain epistemology and ethics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahavira emphasized the importance of all five restraints and is credited with adding brahmacharya (chaste living) to the existing four,  the source material does not state that *all* five were originally his precepts.  The history of Jain ethics suggests a gradual evolution of these principles, with some existing before Mahavira's time.  Attributing all five solely to Mahavira is an oversimplification of the historical development of Jain ethical thought.


**4. With reference to Jain sects, consider the following statements:**

1. The Digambara sect mandates complete nudity for male monks, while female monks wear unstitched white sarees.
2.  The Svetambara sect, unlike the Digambara sect, believes that women can attain the status of Tirthankaras.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key difference between the Digambara and Svetambara sects within Jainism. The Digambara tradition's practice of nudity for male monks and the prescribed attire for female monks are well-documented aspects of their monastic life.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A significant doctrinal difference lies in the belief regarding the possibility of women becoming Tirthankaras. The Svetambara sect accepts this possibility, while the Digambara sect does not. This divergence in belief reflects a fundamental theological distinction between the two major Jain schools.


**5. With reference to Buddhist literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The Milinda Panha, a significant text, features a dialogue between King Milinda and the Buddhist monk Nagasena, exploring profound philosophical questions.
2. The Mahavamsa, written in Pali, primarily focuses on the life of the Buddha and his teachings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Milinda Panha. This text is well-known for its philosophical dialogues between King Menander I and Nagasena, covering a range of important Buddhist concepts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mahavamsa is indeed written in Pali, its content extends far beyond the life and teachings of the Buddha.  The source material explicitly states it chronicles the Buddha's visit to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and also details the history of the kings of Ceylon.  Therefore, the statement's claim of a primary focus on the Buddha's life and teachings is inaccurate.


**6. With reference to the concept of Bodhisattvas in Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Avalokiteshvara, also known as Padmapani, is a prominent Bodhisattva associated with compassion.
2. Maitreya is considered a past Buddha who attained enlightenment before Gautama Buddha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Avalokiteshvara, often depicted holding a lotus flower (hence Padmapani), is a well-known Bodhisattva representing compassion within Mahayana Buddhism. His role and iconography are widely recognized.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Maitreya is explicitly identified in the source material as a *future* Buddha, not a past one.  The text clearly distinguishes between Dipankara (a past Buddha), Gautama Buddha (the present Buddha), and Maitreya (the future Buddha). Confusing Maitreya's role with that of a past Buddha demonstrates a misunderstanding of Buddhist chronology and the Bodhisattva concept.


**7.  With reference to the different schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the attainment of Nirvana through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, focusing on individual liberation.
2. Vajrayana Buddhism, drawing heavily from Theravada traditions, rejects the use of mantras and yantras in its practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core tenets of Theravada Buddhism.  It correctly describes the path to Nirvana and the emphasis on individual practice and liberation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Vajrayana Buddhism, unlike what the statement claims,  *does* incorporate mantras and yantras (ritual diagrams) as integral parts of its practices. The text explicitly mentions Vajrayana's reliance on these tantric elements as a means to achieve Buddhahood more quickly than through other methods.  The statement misrepresents the key characteristics of Vajrayana practice.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning  Jain Agamas:**

1. The Jain Agamas, comprising 46 texts, include 12 Angas, 12 Upangas, and other categories of scriptures.
2. The Digambara sect fully accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the composition and structure of the Jain Agamas. The provided numbers of Angas, Upangas, and the total number of texts align with the information given in the source material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source text explicitly states that the Digambara sect rejects the authority of the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi.  They believe the original teachings were lost and do not accept the later compiled versions.  This highlights a significant difference in canonical authority between the two major Jain schools.


**9. With reference to the Jain Tirthankaras, consider the following statements:**

1. Rishabhanatha, also known as Adinatha, is considered the first Tirthankara in Jain tradition.
2. Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, is widely considered the founder of Jainism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Rishabhanatha, also known as Adinatha, is universally recognized as the first Tirthankara within Jain cosmology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahavira was the 24th and last Tirthankara, the source material explicitly states that Jainism does *not* have a single founder.  The tradition emphasizes a lineage of Tirthankaras, with Mahavira being the most recent in this long line of teachers.  Claiming Mahavira as the founder misrepresents the Jain understanding of their religious origins and the role of the Tirthankaras.


**10. With reference to the practices within Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is universally accepted as a form of suicide within the Jain community.
2. Pratikraman is a process of repentance and self-reflection, aiming to prevent the repetition of past mistakes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The source material explicitly states that Sallekhana is *not* considered suicide by Jain scholars.  While it involves voluntary fasting to death, it is distinguished from suicide due to its specific context and motivations within the religious framework.  The legal challenges surrounding Sallekhana further highlight the complex and contested nature of this practice.

Statement 2 accurately describes Pratikraman.  This practice, involving self-reflection and repentance for past actions, aligns perfectly with Jain emphasis on self-improvement and ethical conduct. The description given in the source material accurately reflects the purpose and significance of Pratikraman within Jain spiritual life.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, evident in the grid-like street layouts of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Evidence suggests the extensive use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during the Harappan period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological excavations at major Harappan sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal a remarkably well-planned urban layout.  The cities were characterized by a grid pattern of streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, demonstrating advanced urban planning capabilities far ahead of their time. This urban planning reflects a high degree of societal organization and engineering skill.  The presence of large public baths and granaries further underscores the advanced nature of their urban design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization possessed advanced technology and evidence of animal domestication, including cattle, there is currently no conclusive archaeological evidence supporting the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during that period. While horse bones have been found at some sites (like Surkotada), their role in warfare remains debated among archaeologists. The absence of clear depictions of chariots in art or artifacts contrasts with the detailed representations of other animals and activities.  Further research is needed to definitively establish the role of horses and chariots in Harappan society.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to help others achieve Nirvana.
2.  The concept of the Triratna (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) is central to Mahayana Buddhism, representing the three jewels of the faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bodhisattva ideal is a core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to guide and assist others on the path to enlightenment.  This emphasis on compassion and selfless service is a defining characteristic that distinguishes Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism.  The concept of the Bodhisattva reflects a more inclusive and compassionate approach to achieving spiritual liberation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Triratna (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) is indeed a fundamental concept in Buddhism, it is not exclusive to Mahayana Buddhism.  It is a central concept shared by both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, representing the three essential aspects of the Buddhist path: the Buddha (the teacher), the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community of practitioners).  Both branches of Buddhism uphold the importance of these three jewels.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's architecture is characterized by the extensive use of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) within temple complexes.
2.  The Battle of Talikota in 1565 marked the beginning of the Vijayanagara Empire's decline and eventual disintegration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Vijayanagara architectural style is renowned for its incorporation of Kalyana Mandapas within its temple complexes. These large, ornate structures served as wedding pavilions and are a prominent feature of the empire's architectural legacy.  The intricate carvings and grandeur of these mandapas reflect the empire's wealth and artistic sophistication.  Examples can be found at various sites within the Hampi complex.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Talikota in 1565 was a decisive turning point in the history of the Vijayanagara Empire.  The defeat at Talikota, at the hands of a combined force of Deccan sultanates, marked the beginning of the empire's decline.  While the empire persisted for some time after the battle, it never regained its former power and influence, leading to its eventual fragmentation and the rise of independent successor states.

His patronage led to the fusion of Persian and Indian artistic styles, resulting in a more naturalistic and detailed approach to representation.  The workshops established during his reign fostered innovation and the creation of a distinct Mughal artistic style.  The use of vibrant colors, detailed depictions of flora and fauna, and a focus on narrative scenes were hallmarks of this period.

Statement 2 is correct.  Emperor Jahangir, himself a keen observer of nature and a patron of the arts, further refined Mughal painting.  His reign was particularly known for its exquisite portraiture.  The portraits often featured the emperor himself, but also incorporated detailed botanical and zoological elements, showcasing the emperor’s interest in natural history and his desire for realistic depiction.  These portraits are highly valued for their artistic merit and historical significance.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily emphasized the importance of rituals and temple worship in achieving spiritual liberation.
2.  Mirabai, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, composed devotional poetry in praise of Lord Krishna, expressing intense personal devotion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some aspects of the Bhakti movement incorporated temple worship, its core emphasis was on personal devotion and direct experience of the divine, rather than strict adherence to rituals.  The movement challenged the rigid hierarchical structures of traditional Hinduism and emphasized the accessibility of God to all, regardless of caste or social standing.  Bhakti poets often stressed personal faith and emotional connection with the divine over ritualistic practices.

Statement 2 is correct. Mirabai was a highly influential figure in the Bhakti movement, particularly within the Krishna bhakti tradition.  Her devotional poetry, characterized by intense personal devotion and passionate expression, has resonated with generations of devotees.  Her compositions are still widely sung and celebrated for their lyrical beauty and spiritual depth.  She exemplifies the movement’s emphasis on individual spiritual experience and emotional connection with the divine.


**6. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of the arch and dome, introduced by the Islamic rulers, became a defining feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, replacing the earlier trabeate style.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture extensively used human and animal figures in its decorative schemes, mirroring the traditions of earlier Hindu temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of the arch and dome by Islamic rulers significantly transformed Indian architecture.  The arcuate style, characterized by the use of arches and domes, replaced the earlier trabeate style (primarily using lintels and beams) prevalent in Hindu temple architecture. This architectural shift reflects the fusion of Islamic and Indian artistic traditions.  The use of arches and domes allowed for the creation of larger, more spacious structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Unlike the earlier Hindu temple architecture, which frequently featured elaborate sculptures of deities, animals, and humans, Indo-Islamic architecture largely avoided the use of figural representations.  This avoidance stemmed from religious beliefs within Islam that discouraged the creation of images.  Instead, Indo-Islamic architecture emphasized geometric patterns, calligraphy, and arabesque designs for decoration.  The decorative schemes focused on abstract designs and intricate detailing rather than figural representations.


**7. With reference to the  accounts of foreign travelers to India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Megasthenes, in his account "Indica," provides detailed information about the Mauryan administration, social structure, and religious practices in ancient India.
2.  Ibn Battuta's "Rihla" offers a comprehensive description of the political landscape, social customs, and economic activities of the Vijayanagara Empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, left behind a valuable account known as "Indica." Although the original manuscript is lost, fragments and references from other writers provide significant information about the Mauryan Empire.  "Indica" offers insights into the Mauryan administration, social hierarchy (including the caste system), and religious practices.  It provides a valuable glimpse into the life and society of ancient India during the Mauryan period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's "Rihla" is a rich source for understanding various aspects of medieval India, including the Delhi Sultanate, it doesn't provide a detailed account of the Vijayanagara Empire.  Ibn Battuta's travels did not extensively cover the Vijayanagara region.  Other travelers, such as Abdur Razzaq and Domingo Paes, provide more detailed accounts of the Vijayanagara Empire’s political structure, social life, and economic conditions.


**8. With reference to the  religious movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nathpanthis, a sect associated with Gorakhnath, emphasized the practice of Hatha Yoga and led an ascetic movement characterized by both spiritual and martial aspects.
2.  The Varakari Sampradaya, associated with Eknath, focused primarily on the worship of Lord Shiva and promoted the use of Sanskrit in its devotional literature.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nathpanthis, a sect of Shaivism, are closely associated with Gorakhnath, a prominent Nath Yogi.  Their practices emphasized Hatha Yoga, a system of physical and spiritual disciplines.  The Nathpanthis also played a significant role in a warrior-ascetic movement, combining spiritual practices with martial arts skills.  They often resisted oppression and participated in social and political movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Varakari Sampradaya, a significant movement within the Bhakti tradition, was associated with figures like Jnanadeva and Eknath.  While it emphasized devotion to Lord Vithoba (a form of Vishnu), it didn't primarily focus on Lord Shiva.  Furthermore, the Varakari Sampradaya predominantly employed Marathi and other regional languages in its devotional literature, rather than Sanskrit, to reach a wider audience.  The use of vernacular languages was a key characteristic of the Bhakti movement.


**9. With reference to the  literary traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kalidasa, renowned for his Sanskrit plays, including "Shakuntala," "Vikramorvasiya," and "Malavikagnimitra," is considered one of the greatest poets of classical Sanskrit literature.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a Sufi poet and musician, is credited with the development of the Urdu language and the invention of the sitar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kalidasa is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished poets and dramatists of classical Sanskrit literature. His plays, including "Shakuntala," "Vikramorvasiya," and "Malavikagnimitra," are celebrated for their poetic beauty, sophisticated language, and exploration of complex themes.  His works showcase the high point of classical Sanskrit drama and poetry, influencing subsequent literary traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Amir Khusrau made significant contributions to the development of Urdu poetry and music, he is not credited with the invention of the sitar. The precise origins of the sitar are debated, but its evolution involved a complex process over time.  Khusrau's contributions to music included the development of new musical forms and styles, incorporating Persian and Arabic influences into Indian classical music, but not the invention of the sitar itself.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hampi monuments complex in Karnataka represents a remarkable blend of architectural styles and religious traditions.  The site includes numerous structures of Hindu and Jain origin, reflecting the religious diversity of the Vijayanagara Empire.  The temples, palaces, and other structures showcase the empire's artistic achievements and technological capabilities.  The site's significance lies in its representation of a major historical period and its architectural diversity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh are a UNESCO World Heritage Site of exceptional significance.  They contain a large collection of Paleolithic cave paintings, providing invaluable insights into the lives and artistic practices of early humans.  The paintings depict various aspects of daily life, hunting scenes, and religious motifs, offering a unique glimpse into prehistory. The site’s significance lies in its contribution to understanding early human history and artistic development.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Devanagari script, primarily used for writing Sanskrit, is also employed for over 120 languages, including Hindi and Marathi.
2. The Modi script, historically the official script for Marathi, was largely replaced in the 20th century by the Balbodh style of the Devanagari script.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Devanagari is indeed a widely used abugida script in India and Nepal, employed for numerous languages beyond Sanskrit, prominently including Hindi and Marathi. Its adaptability and prevalence make it one of the most used writing systems globally.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Modi script served as the official Marathi script until the 20th century.  The rise of the Balbodh style of Devanagari led to its decline as the standard writing system for Marathi, although Modi continues to hold historical significance and some continued usage.  The shift reflects the broader trends of script standardization and adoption in India.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the historical and contemporary usage of these scripts.


**2. With reference to Indian writing traditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The spread of Buddhism significantly influenced the scripts of Sri Lanka, Tibet, and Southeast Asia.
2. The introduction of Islam in India caused minimal change in the existing Indian writing traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The dissemination of Buddhism from India profoundly impacted the development of writing systems in several regions.  The adoption and adaptation of Indian scripts, often modified to suit local phonetic needs, are evident in the scripts of Sri Lanka, Tibet, and several Southeast Asian countries. This demonstrates the significant cultural exchange and influence associated with the spread of Buddhism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The arrival of Islam in India led to substantial changes in Indian writing traditions. The introduction of the Perso-Arabic script and its subsequent adaptation for Urdu and other languages fundamentally altered the linguistic landscape.  This introduction significantly impacted the written forms of many Indo-Aryan languages and led to a cultural fusion in literary styles. The influence was not minimal; it was a transformative period in the history of Indian writing. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the classification of Indian languages, consider the following statements:**

1. The majority of languages spoken in India belong to the Dravidian language family.
2. Sanskrit, a language listed in the Indian Constitution's Eighth Schedule, belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Dravidian language family is significant in South India, the Indo-Aryan family encompasses a far larger number of languages spoken across the Indian subcontinent.  The Indo-Aryan languages constitute the majority of languages spoken in India.

Statement 2 is correct. Sanskrit, a classical language of India, is indeed part of the Indo-Aryan language family.  Its inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution reflects its historical and cultural importance.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the classification of Indian languages.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam are all classified under the Indo-Aryan language group.
2.  Konkani, a language officially recognized as a classical language of India, belongs to the Dravidian language family.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam are all Dravidian languages, not Indo-Aryan.  The Dravidian language family is distinct from the Indo-Aryan family, with different origins and linguistic characteristics.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Konkani is an Indo-Aryan language, not Dravidian, despite its official recognition as a classical language.  The classification of languages is based on linguistic relationships and historical development.  Therefore, both statements contain factual errors regarding the language families.


**5. With reference to the status of languages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Hindi is the sole national language of India as enshrined in the Constitution.
2. English, while not included in the Eighth Schedule, holds official status for certain governmental functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India does not have a single national language.  While Hindi is widely spoken and holds official status in many parts of the country, the Constitution recognizes the plurality of languages and doesn't designate any one as the sole national language.

Statement 2 is correct.  English, though not listed in the Eighth Schedule (which lists the officially recognized regional languages), retains official status for various central government functions, particularly in administration and inter-state communication.  This reflects the historical and practical role of English in India. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the evolution of Hindi, consider the following statements:**

1. Hindi's development is directly traceable to Pali, an ancient language of Buddhism.
2. The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to the popularization and standardization of Hindi, shifting away from the dominance of Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Prakrit and Apabhramsa are crucial predecessors to modern Hindi, Pali's direct influence is not as significant in the evolutionary lineage.  Hindi's development is more directly linked to the Apabhramsa stage of Prakrit evolution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bhakti movement played a pivotal role in promoting vernacular languages like Hindi.  Bhakti poets actively used Hindi (and its various dialects) to express their devotional sentiments, making it accessible to a wider audience and challenging the dominance of Sanskrit, which was associated with the Brahminical elite. This contributed to the growth and eventual standardization of Hindi as a literary language.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Guru Granth Sahib, the central religious text of Sikhism, is entirely written in the Devanagari script.
2. The Adi Granth, a precursor to the Guru Granth Sahib, includes compositions in Hindi and Braj, alongside Punjabi written in Gurmukhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Guru Granth Sahib is primarily written in Gurmukhi script, not Devanagari.  Gurmukhi is a distinct script developed specifically for Punjabi and is integral to Sikh religious identity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Adi Granth, indeed, contains a blend of languages and scripts.  It includes compositions in Punjabi (Gurmukhi), Hindi, and Braj Bhasha, reflecting the diverse linguistic influences of the Bhakti movement and the early stages of Sikhism.  This linguistic diversity is a key feature of the Adi Granth's composition.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the history of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan civilization showcased sophisticated urban planning, evident in the grid patterns of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, but lacked significant monumental architecture.
2.  The rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, dating back to the Mauryan period, predates the Ajanta Caves, which were constructed during the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Harappan civilization did exhibit remarkable urban planning with its grid system, the statement that it lacked significant monumental architecture is an oversimplification.  While not on the scale of later empires, structures like the Great Bath and the citadels in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa suggest a degree of monumental construction.

Statement 2 is correct. The rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli is indeed a Mauryan-era creation, predating the Ajanta caves, which were developed during the Gupta period. This chronological difference reflects the evolution of Indian rock-cut architecture over centuries. Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate.


**9. With reference to the evolution of Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional variations in Indian temple architecture.
2. The Kalyana Mandapa, a significant feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture, served as a communal space for religious gatherings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three major architectural styles found in different regions of India.  These styles are distinguished by their structural features, ornamentation, and regional variations in design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Kalyana Mandapa is a prominent feature in Vijayanagara temple architecture, its primary function was not as a communal space for general religious gatherings.  It was primarily a wedding pavilion or a space for auspicious ceremonies related to marriage and royal events.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the evolution of Indian temple architecture.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri was primarily used by Akbar as a private chamber for prayer.
2.  The Panchayatan style of temple construction, characterized by a central shrine and four smaller shrines at the corners, is primarily associated with the Nagara architectural style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri was not primarily a private prayer chamber for Akbar. It served as a space for religious discussions and debates among scholars of different faiths.  Akbar's policy of religious tolerance is reflected in the use of this space for interfaith dialogue.

Statement 2 is correct. The Panchayatan style of temple construction, with its central and four corner shrines, is a characteristic feature, most strongly associated with the Nagara style of temple architecture.  This style is often found in North Indian temples.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Konark and the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram were both inscribed as World Heritage Sites in the same year.
2.  The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) in Mumbai is a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognized for its Victorian Gothic architecture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sun Temple at Konark and the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram were not inscribed in the same year. They were inscribed in different years.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is indeed a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its exceptional example of Victorian Gothic architecture.  Its inclusion reflects the site's architectural significance and historical importance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**12. With reference to the  Indian musical traditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, contains musical notations and is considered a source for understanding early Indian music.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samaveda does indeed contain musical notations and is considered an important source for understanding early Indian musical traditions.  Its melodic chants and musical structure provide insights into the development of Indian music.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Natyashastra, while primarily a treatise on dramaturgy, does include significant sections on music theory, including discussions of scales, rhythms, and musical instruments. It is a crucial text for understanding the theoretical foundations of Indian classical music.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**13.  With reference to prominent figures in Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tansen, a legendary musician in the court of Akbar, primarily composed Dhrupads in the Hindustani classical tradition.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a multifaceted personality, made significant contributions to both literature and Hindustani classical music.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tansen, a prominent figure in the Mughal court, is renowned for his mastery of Dhrupad, a significant form within the Hindustani classical music tradition. His compositions and contributions to the genre are well-documented.

Statement 2 is also correct. Amir Khusrau was a prolific poet, writer, and musician, making significant contributions to both the literary and musical landscape of his time. His contributions to Hindustani classical music are widely acknowledged. His influence on the development of certain musical forms is significant. Therefore, both statements are accurate.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. While the Thanjavur school is known for its use of gold, its major patronage came from the Marathas, not the Cholas.  Furthermore, the statement about GI status is incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Raja Ravi Varma, while considered a pioneer of modern Indian art, hailed from Kerala, not Maharashtra. The painting mentioned is indeed one of his famous works.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies.


**15. With reference to Indian painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bengal School of Art, a significant movement in Indian art history, was primarily influenced by European artistic styles and techniques.
2.  Pattachitra, a traditional style of painting from Odisha, primarily uses natural pigments and is characterized by its narrative depictions of deities and mythological stories.

Statement 2 is correct. Pattachitra, originating in Odisha, is indeed known for its use of natural pigments and its narrative style, frequently depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and religious themes.  The use of cloth as a canvas and the vibrant colours are characteristic features. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

1. Mahayana Buddhism emphasized the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.
2.  The development of image worship and elaborate rituals, a significant departure from earlier Buddhist traditions, became prominent features of Mahayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism is the concept of Bodhisattvas. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which focuses on individual enlightenment and the attainment of Nirvana, Mahayana Buddhism introduced the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving enlightenment, choose to delay their own Nirvana to guide others towards liberation. This emphasis on compassion and selfless service became a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.


Statement 2 is also correct.  Mahayana Buddhism witnessed a significant shift in religious practices, incorporating elements of image worship and ritualistic ceremonies. This contrasted sharply with the earlier, more ascetic and aniconic traditions of Buddhism. The development of elaborate rituals and the creation of Buddha images facilitated the wider dissemination of Buddhist teachings and its adoption by diverse populations. This shift is a key difference between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, impacting the religious landscape of various regions.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara rulers were known for their patronage of the arts, evident in the construction of magnificent temples like the Vitthala Temple at Hampi, which featured intricate carvings and Kalyana Mandapas.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's economy was primarily agrarian, though it also benefited from a thriving trade network, connecting it to both domestic and international markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire is renowned for its remarkable architectural achievements.  The Vitthala Temple at Hampi stands as a testament to their artistic patronage. Its intricate carvings, the unique musical pillars, and the presence of Kalyana Mandapas (wedding pavilions) showcase the empire's sophisticated artistic sensibilities and its commitment to temple architecture.  These structures highlight the advanced craftsmanship and artistic skills prevalent during the Vijayanagara period.


Statement 2 is also correct. While agriculture formed the backbone of the Vijayanagara Empire's economy, it wasn't solely agrarian. The empire strategically benefited from extensive trade networks, connecting it to both domestic and international markets. This facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas, contributing significantly to the empire's wealth and prosperity.  The strategic location of Vijayanagara facilitated trade, leading to economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the reign of Akbar saw the flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, a significant shift occurred during the reign of Jahangir, who was himself a keen painter and patron of the arts.  His reign witnessed a notable increase in emphasis on individual portraits, often depicting flora and fauna, and the creation of albums containing collections of these paintings. This reflects a change in artistic preferences from large-scale narrative works to a focus on individual representation and detailed observation.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri was not a private chamber for Akbar's personal prayers. Instead, it served as a place for religious discussions and debates among scholars from various faiths, reflecting Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in diverse religious perspectives.  It was a venue for intellectual exchange and dialogue, not solely a place of personal devotion.


**5. With reference to Saint Kabir, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of God and criticized the rituals and practices of both Hinduism and Islam.
2.  Saint Kabir was significantly influenced by the teachings of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent Sufi scholar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Saint Kabir's philosophy transcended the boundaries of organized religion.  His teachings focused on the concept of Nirguna Brahman (formless God) and criticized the rigid rituals and practices of both Hinduism and Islam. He emphasized the importance of bhakti (devotion) and the direct experience of God, irrespective of religious affiliation.  His poetry contains sharp critiques of religious hypocrisy.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Saint Kabir predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi.  Kabir lived in the 15th century, while Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi lived in the 16th and 17th centuries.  Therefore, there could be no direct influence of Sirhindi on Kabir's teachings.  The chronological discrepancy makes this statement factually inaccurate.


**6. With reference to Indian painting, consider the following statements:**

1. The Thanjavur school of painting is characterized by its use of gold coating and vibrant colors, depicting primarily Hindu deities and scenes from Hindu epics.
2. The Thanjavur school of painting received significant patronage from the Maratha rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Thanjavur school of painting is indeed known for its distinctive features. It is characterized by the extensive use of gold leaf and vibrant colors, creating a rich and opulent visual effect. The paintings primarily depict Hindu deities and scenes from Hindu mythology and epics.  The intricate details and the use of gold are key identifiers of this style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Thanjavur school flourished during the Maratha period, its patronage wasn't solely from the Marathas.  It received patronage from various rulers and patrons over its history, including Nayaka rulers. Attributing the patronage solely to the Marathas is an oversimplification of its historical context.


**7. With reference to the Bengal School of Art, consider the following statements:**

1. Abanindranath Tagore was a prominent figure and played a pivotal role in establishing and shaping the aesthetic principles of the Bengal School of Art.
2.  Rabindranath Tagore, though primarily known for his literary contributions, also played a significant role in promoting and supporting the Bengal School of Art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abanindranath Tagore is widely recognized as a key figure in the development of the Bengal School of Art.  He played a crucial role in defining its artistic ideology, promoting a distinct Indian style that drew inspiration from traditional Indian art forms and sought to counter the influence of Western academic art.  His artistic vision and leadership were instrumental in shaping the school's identity.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While Rabindranath Tagore's primary contribution lies in literature, he actively supported and promoted the Bengal School of Art. His influence extended beyond direct artistic involvement; his intellectual and philosophical perspectives resonated with the school's aims and ideals, contributing to its broader cultural impact.  His patronage and endorsement played a role in the school's success.


**8. With reference to Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves, known for their remarkable preservation and unique architectural features, were originally constructed for the Ajivikas by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.
2. The caves at Badami represent some of the earliest surviving examples of rock-cut architecture in India, showcasing sophisticated carving techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves are indeed among the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India and are known for their exceptional preservation.  They were initially constructed during the Mauryan period, specifically under the patronage of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya for the Ajivika sect.  The caves' unique architectural features, such as their polished surfaces, are remarkable examples of early rock-cut technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not among the earliest surviving ones in India.  The Barabar caves predate the Badami caves significantly.  Therefore, claiming the Badami caves as the earliest examples is factually inaccurate.


**9. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization possessed elaborate palaces and temples, indicating a hierarchical social structure and a well-developed religious system.
2.  Archaeological evidence suggests the Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities, reflecting a complex religious belief system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization possessed sophisticated urban planning and impressive structures, there's limited evidence of elaborate palaces and temples in the same manner as found in later civilizations.  The interpretation of many structures is still debated, and the evidence doesn't definitively support the existence of large-scale palaces and temples.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings, such as the discovery of various figurines and seals, suggest the worship of both male and female deities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  This indicates a more complex religious belief system than previously thought, with evidence pointing towards a range of religious practices and beliefs. The presence of both male and female figurines is strong evidence of this.


**10. With reference to Sangam Literature, consider the following statements:**

1. Sangam literature comprises a vast collection of poems and prose works, offering invaluable insights into the social, cultural, and political life of ancient Tamil society.
2. The precise historical accounts of the first two Sangams are well-documented and verifiable, providing accurate chronological frameworks for understanding the development of Tamil literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sangam literature is a significant corpus of Tamil literature, providing a rich window into the ancient Tamil world.  The poems and prose works contained within offer insights into the social structures, cultural practices, political systems, and even the natural environment of the region during that period. This collection is a crucial source for understanding the history and culture of ancient Tamil Nadu.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the concept of Sangams is integral to Tamil literary history, the historical accuracy and detailed documentation of the first two Sangams are debated among scholars.  Many consider the accounts of the first two Sangams to be more legendary or mythical than strictly historical, with limited verifiable evidence to support their precise chronology.  The third Sangam has more reliable historical documentation.





**1. With reference to the architectural features of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara style is characterized by the extensive use of  intricate carvings and sculptures depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and daily life.
2.  Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions) were a prominent feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara architectural style is renowned for its grandeur and intricate detailing.  Statement 1 is accurate because  Vijayanagara temples and structures were lavishly adorned with sculptures and carvings, often depicting scenes from Hindu epics, Puranas, and daily life. This reflects the strong religious and cultural identity of the empire.  The sculptures were not merely decorative but integral to the temple's religious function and served as a visual narrative of faith.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kalyana mandapas, or wedding pavilions, were a distinctive feature of Vijayanagara temple architecture. These structures were often elaborately decorated and served as spaces for important ceremonies and rituals related to marriage and other celebrations within the temple complex.  Their presence highlights the importance of social and religious life within the temple setting.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Vijayanagara architecture. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually correct representations of the architectural style of the Vijayanagara Empire.


**2. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization is Mohenjo-daro, characterized by its sophisticated urban planning and drainage systems.
2.  Evidence of horse domestication has been found at several sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, indicating their use in warfare and transportation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mohenjo-daro is a significant site known for its urban planning and drainage, Rakhigarhi in Haryana is currently considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization. The statement incorrectly attributes the "largest" title to Mohenjo-daro.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While evidence of various animals has been found in the Indus Valley Civilization, conclusive evidence of horse domestication during this period is debated among archaeologists.  Some findings are interpreted as potentially indicating the presence of horses, but not widespread domestication for warfare or transport in the way it was later used in other civilizations. The statement overstates the level of evidence for horse domestication.

Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge about the specifics of the Indus Valley Civilization and avoids common misconceptions.


**3. With reference to the Buddhist Councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Buddhist Council, held at Rajgriha, resulted in the compilation of the Vinaya Pitaka, focusing on monastic rules and discipline.
2. The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of Emperor Kanishka, led to the definitive split between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The First Buddhist Council, convened in Rajgriha shortly after the death of the Buddha, is traditionally credited with the standardization and compilation of the Vinaya Pitaka.  This Pitaka outlines the rules of monastic conduct and discipline, forming a crucial foundation for the early Buddhist Sangha. The council aimed at preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Fourth Buddhist Council, held under Kanishka, is associated with a significant development in Buddhist thought, it didn’t definitively mark the split between Hinayana and Mahayana. The schism had already begun earlier and was a gradual process of evolving theological and philosophical differences.  The council did contribute to the formalization of existing differences but did not cause the initial split.

Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making option (a) the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuanced history of Buddhist Councils and avoids simplistic generalizations.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti Movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu and Shiva, neglecting other deities.
2.  Mirabai, a prominent Bhakti saint, composed devotional songs primarily in Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement saw a significant rise in the devotion towards Vishnu and Shiva, it encompassed a wide range of deities and traditions.  Various saints and poets within the movement focused on different aspects of the divine, reflecting the rich diversity of Hindu faith.  The statement presents an overly simplistic view of the movement’s scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Mirabai, a celebrated Bhakti saint, composed devotional songs primarily in Rajasthani, a vernacular language, not Sanskrit.  Her use of the local language made her message accessible to a wider audience, a key characteristic of the Bhakti movement's outreach.  The statement misrepresents the language used in her compositions.

Thus, both statements are incorrect, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question emphasizes the need to understand the diversity and linguistic aspects of the Bhakti movement.


**5. With reference to the Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas are a collection of sacred texts considered to be the teachings of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara.
2.  The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Jain Agamas compiled at the Vallabhi council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jain Agamas are a collection of sacred canonical texts in Jainism, traditionally believed to contain the teachings of Mahavira and earlier Tirthankaras.  These texts serve as a foundation for Jain religious practices and philosophical understanding. The statement accurately describes the nature and significance of the Agamas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digambara sect of Jainism does *not* accept the authority of the Agamas compiled at the Vallabhi council.  They believe that the original teachings were lost and that the Vallabhi compilation does not represent the authentic scriptures. This difference in scriptural authority is a key distinction between the Digambara and Svetambara sects.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making option (a) the correct choice. This question tests specific knowledge about the internal divisions and scriptural traditions within Jainism.


**6. With reference to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Konark and the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram were inscribed as World Heritage Sites in the same year.
2.  The Red Fort Complex in Delhi was inscribed as a World Heritage Site before the Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sun Temple at Konark (Odisha) was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1984, while the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu) was inscribed in the same year. However the question states that it was inscribed in the same year but it should have been different years.

Statement 2 is correct. The Red Fort Complex in Delhi was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 2007. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya was inscribed earlier, in 2002. The question correctly reflects the chronological order of inscription.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India.


**7. With reference to the  schools of Indian Philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Charvaka school is known for its materialistic and hedonistic philosophy, rejecting the concepts of soul and afterlife.
2.  The Nyaya school primarily focuses on epistemology (theory of knowledge) and logic, providing a framework for understanding reality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Charvaka school of Indian philosophy.  This school is known for its radical materialism, emphasizing the importance of sensory experience and rejecting the existence of a soul, afterlife, and the authority of the Vedas.  It advocated a hedonistic approach to life, focusing on worldly pleasures.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the Nyaya school's main focus.  The Nyaya school is primarily concerned with epistemology and logic. It developed a systematic framework for understanding valid knowledge and reasoning, which has significantly influenced other schools of Indian philosophy.

Both statements are factually correct, making (c) the correct option. The question assesses understanding of distinct schools of Indian philosophy and their core tenets.


**8. With reference to the Mughal painting style, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal painting style was significantly influenced by Persian miniature painting techniques.
2.  Jahangir's reign saw a decline in the quality and innovation of Mughal painting compared to Akbar's era.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal painting style, which flourished under the Mughal Empire in India, drew heavily upon Persian miniature painting traditions.  Persian artists and techniques were introduced into the Mughal court, resulting in a unique synthesis of Persian and Indian artistic styles.  The statement accurately reflects the stylistic influences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jahangir's reign, while different in style from Akbar's, did not see a decline in the quality and innovation of Mughal painting.  Jahangir himself was a patron of the arts, and his reign witnessed the development of a distinct style characterized by naturalism and detailed depictions of flora, fauna, and portraits.  The statement misrepresents the artistic achievements of Jahangir's period.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate option.  The question tests knowledge of the historical development and stylistic influences within Mughal painting.


**9. With reference to the  religious practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana, a practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered a form of suicide by all religious scholars.
2. Pratikraman is a Jain practice of daily repentance for sins committed throughout the day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting unto death, is a complex issue with varying interpretations. While some consider it a form of suicide, many Jain scholars view it differently, arguing that it's a ritualistic practice undertaken with specific religious motivations and not driven by self-destruction or despair. The statement presents an overly simplistic and potentially biased view.

Statement 2 is correct. Pratikraman is an integral part of daily Jain religious practice.  It involves a process of self-reflection, confession, and repentance for any wrongdoings or shortcomings during the day.  This practice emphasizes self-improvement and ethical conduct.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The question highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of complex religious practices and avoids generalizations.


**10. With reference to  the  development of  Indian  classical  music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samaveda contains the earliest known musical notations in Indian history.
2.  Bharata Muni's Natyashastra provides a comprehensive treatise on music, including the identification of the 22 shrutis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the exact nature of musical notation in the Samaveda is a subject of scholarly debate, it does contain melodic chants (samans) that are considered to be precursors to the development of Indian classical music.  The statement accurately reflects the Samaveda's significance in the early history of Indian music.

Statement 2 is also correct. Bharata Muni's Natyashastra is a foundational text for Indian performing arts, including music and dance.  The text contains significant discussions on musical theory, including the identification of the 22 shrutis (microtones) which form the basis of the Indian musical system.  The statement correctly highlights the Natyashastra's contribution to music theory.


Therefore, both statements are largely correct, making (c) the correct answer. The question tests knowledge of the historical development of Indian classical music and its theoretical foundations.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, asserts the existence of a single, absolute truth that can be definitively known.
2.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism—Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct—are essential for achieving liberation (moksha).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Anekantavada, a central tenet of Jainism, actually posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives.  It rejects the notion of a single, absolute truth that can be completely grasped. The concept emphasizes the limitations of human perception and understanding, acknowledging that the truth is complex and may be perceived differently depending on the observer's viewpoint. This is in direct contrast to the statement's assertion of a single, definitive truth.

Statement 2 is correct. The three jewels (Ratnatraya) – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) – are indeed fundamental pillars of Jain philosophy.  These principles represent the path to spiritual liberation (moksha), emphasizing the importance of ethical behavior, correct understanding, and unwavering faith in the Jain teachings.  Achieving liberation involves the purification of the soul through adherence to these principles.  The emphasis on these three jewels permeates all aspects of Jain practice and belief.


**2. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes individual salvation through personal practice and meditation, rejecting the concept of Bodhisattvas.
2.  The deification of the Buddha and the practice of image worship are central features of Mahayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mahayana Buddhism, unlike Theravada, actively promotes the concept of Bodhisattvas.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who postpone their own nirvana to assist others in achieving enlightenment. This emphasizes compassion and the collective pursuit of spiritual liberation, a key difference from the more individualistic focus often associated with Theravada Buddhism. The notion of individual salvation, while present, is significantly interwoven with the Bodhisattva ideal of universal compassion.


Statement 2 is correct. The Mahayana school is characterized by the deification of the Buddha and the widespread practice of image worship.  This contrasts sharply with the earlier Hinayana schools, which generally avoided such practices. The reverence for Buddha images and the performance of various rituals became integral aspects of Mahayana Buddhist practice, reflecting a shift towards a more devotional and accessible form of Buddhism.


**3. With reference to the evolution of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fourth Buddhist Council, held in Kashmir under the patronage of King Kanishka, resulted in the definitive establishment of Theravada Buddhism as the sole dominant school.
2. The three major Pitakas—Vinaya, Sutta, and Abhidhamma—were compiled during the first three Buddhist Councils, forming the Tripitaka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of King Kanishka, is associated with a significant division within Buddhism, leading to the emergence of Mahayana Buddhism alongside the existing schools.  Theravada Buddhism continued to exist, but it was not established as the sole dominant school as a result of this council. The council’s deliberations involved a significant debate and ultimately did not result in a singular unified Buddhist school.

Statement 2 is correct. The three major Pitakas (Vinaya, Sutta, and Abhidhamma) were indeed compiled during the first three Buddhist Councils, collectively known as the Tripitaka. These councils were crucial in preserving and standardizing the Buddha's teachings, shaping the development of various Buddhist schools and traditions.  The compilation of these texts represents a monumental effort to document and transmit the core doctrines of Buddhism.


**4. With reference to the Jain sects, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara sect permits the use of clothing by its monks, while the Svetambara sect mandates complete nudity.
2.  Both Digambara and Svetambara sects accept the authority of the Jain Agamas as sacred scriptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digambara sect is known for its tradition of monastic nudity, while the Svetambara monks wear white clothes.  The statement incorrectly reverses these practices.  The difference in attire reflects differing interpretations of ascetic ideals within Jainism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Svetambara sect accepts the Jain Agamas, the Digambara sect does not consider them to be authoritative scriptures. This difference in scriptural authority reflects a fundamental divergence between the two sects.  The Digambaras believe the original teachings were lost, while the Svetambaras maintain the Agamas as a reliable source of Jain doctrine.


**5. With reference to the  Swastika symbol in Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swastika in the Jain flag symbolizes the four stages of human life—childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age—through which the soul progresses.
2. The three dots above the Swastika in the Jain flag represent the three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swastika in the Jain flag represents the four forms in which the soul can exist: deities, humans, animals/plants, and hell beings. The progression or degradation of the soul through these forms is determined by karma, and the ultimate goal is liberation from this cycle.  The statement conflates the Swastika's symbolic meaning with the stages of human life, which is not accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The three dots above the Swastika are indeed representative of the three jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism: Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.  These three principles are central to the Jain path to liberation.  The placement of the dots above the Swastika visually reinforces the importance of these principles in guiding the soul towards its ultimate goal.


**6. With reference to the concept of Anekantavada, consider the following statements:**

1. Anekantavada is a core philosophical concept primarily associated with Buddhism.
2.  Anekantavada emphasizes that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives, rejecting the notion of a single, absolute truth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Anekantavada is fundamentally a Jain philosophical concept, not Buddhist.  While both Jainism and Buddhism share some common ground in their rejection of rigid dogmatism, Anekantavada is uniquely central to Jain thought.  Its emphasis on the multifaceted nature of reality is a cornerstone of Jain metaphysics and epistemology.

Statement 2 is correct. Anekantavada accurately reflects the Jain belief that reality is complex and possesses multiple, equally valid perspectives.  It rejects the idea of a single, absolute truth accessible to human understanding, acknowledging the limitations of human perception and the inherent complexity of existence. This principle is fundamental to the Jain approach to knowledge and understanding.


**7. With reference to  Jain practices, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered a form of suicide by Jain scholars and is strictly prohibited.
2. Pratikraman is a daily ritualistic practice in Jainism where individuals reflect on their actions and repent for their misdeeds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sallekhana involves the voluntary relinquishment of food and water, leading to death, it is not considered suicide by many Jain scholars.  It is viewed as a form of self-discipline undertaken under specific circumstances and with strict adherence to ethical guidelines.  The intention is not self-destruction but rather the purification of the soul and release from the cycle of rebirth.  However, there is ongoing debate and legal challenges regarding this practice.

Statement 2 is correct. Pratikraman is a significant daily practice in Jainism where individuals engage in introspection, acknowledging their past wrongdoings and resolving to avoid repeating them. This emphasizes self-awareness, accountability, and the ongoing pursuit of ethical conduct.  It is a crucial aspect of the Jain path to spiritual purification.


**8. With reference to the  Jain Tirthankaras, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, is considered the founder of Jainism, establishing the religion's core tenets and practices.
2.  The 23 Tirthankaras before Mahavira are not considered significant figures in Jain history or theology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahavira is the last and most widely known Tirthankara, Jainism does not have a single founder in the way that some other religions do.  The Tirthankaras are seen as enlightened teachers who have appeared throughout history to guide humanity towards liberation. Mahavira's teachings are central to modern Jainism, but the tradition predates him.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 23 Tirthankaras who preceded Mahavira are highly revered figures within Jainism. Each is believed to have achieved enlightenment and taught a path to liberation, contributing to the rich tapestry of Jain history and theology. Their stories and teachings are important elements of Jain scriptures and traditions.  The 23 Tirthankaras are not less significant compared to Mahavira.


**9. With reference to the  Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas are a collection of sacred texts considered authoritative scriptures by both the Digambara and Svetambara sects.
2. The Agamas were originally compiled by the Ganadharas, the chief disciples of Mahavira, and have remained unchanged throughout history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jain Agamas are accepted as authoritative scriptures by the Svetambara sect, but the Digambara sect does not consider them authoritative. The Digambaras believe the original teachings were lost long ago.  This difference in scriptural authority reflects a significant divergence in the theological and philosophical interpretations of the two sects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Agamas are believed to have originated from the teachings of Mahavira and were initially compiled by his Ganadharas, they have undergone revisions and interpretations over time. The present form of the Agamas is the result of various compilations and redactions, particularly the council of monks held in Vallabhi during the 5th century AD. The idea of complete immutability of the Agamas throughout history is not supported by historical evidence.


**10. With reference to  the two major schools of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Svetambara sect follows only four of the five main vows (excluding Brahmacharya) as taught by Mahavira, while the Digambara sect adheres to all five.
2.  Both the Digambara and Svetambara sects believe that women can attain the status of Tirthankara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Svetambara sect traditionally emphasizes the observance of four main vows (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha), while the Digambara sect adheres to all five vows, including Brahmacharya (chastity). This difference in emphasis reflects different interpretations of Mahavira's teachings and the ideal of ascetic practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digambara sect does not believe women can become Tirthankaras, while the Svetambara sect does.  This difference in belief concerning gender and spiritual attainment represents a significant theological divergence between the two sects.  The Digambara perspective is based on a stricter interpretation of traditional Jain texts and beliefs.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain philosophy posits that the universe is composed of five eternal substances: Jiva (soul), Pudgala (matter), Akasha (space), Dharma (motion), and Adharma (rest).
2.  Digambara Jains believe that women cannot be Tirthankaras, while Svetambaras hold that Tirthankaras can be both male and female.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Svetambara Jains believe in five eternal substances (Jiva, Pudgala, Akasha, Dharma, Adharma), Digambara Jains add a sixth: Kala (time).  The difference in the number of eternal substances highlights a key divergence between the two major sects of Jainism. This is a crucial point for understanding the nuances of Jain cosmology and metaphysics.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of this subtle distinction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Digambara sect maintains a stricter adherence to traditional interpretations, excluding women from the possibility of becoming Tirthankaras.  The Svetambara sect holds a more inclusive view, allowing for the possibility of female Tirthankaras. This difference reflects varying interpretations of Jain scriptures and traditions, and understanding this contrast demonstrates a comprehensive grasp of Jain sectarianism. The inclusion of this statement challenges candidates to recall specific beliefs of the different Jain sects.


**2. With reference to the Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas are considered sacred texts containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras and were originally compiled by the Ganadharas, the chief disciples of Mahavira.
2. The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi during the mid-5th century AD, while the Svetambara sect rejects them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jain Agamas are indeed considered sacred scriptures, believed to contain the teachings of the Tirthankaras.  The Ganadharas, Mahavira's chief disciples, are traditionally credited with their initial compilation.  This statement assesses the candidate's understanding of the foundational texts of Jainism and their historical context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  It is the Svetambaras who accept the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi as authoritative. The Digambaras, conversely, believe that the original teachings were lost and reject the later Vallabhi compilation.  This reversal of roles in the statement serves as a critical distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the sectarian differences within Jainism.  The question highlights the complexities of Jain history and textual transmission.


**3.  With reference to the concept of Anekantavada in Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Anekantavada emphasizes that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives, thus rejecting the notion of a single, absolute truth.
2.  Anekantavada is a core philosophical principle shared by both Jainism and Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Anekantavada, a cornerstone of Jain philosophy, asserts that reality is complex and possesses numerous facets.  It rejects the existence of a singular, absolute truth, acknowledging the validity of multiple viewpoints depending on the perspective and context. This statement assesses the candidate's understanding of a fundamental Jain philosophical concept and its implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both Jainism and Buddhism emphasize the limitations of human perception and the complexities of reality, Anekantavada is uniquely Jain. Buddhism, while acknowledging multiple paths to enlightenment, does not share the same emphasis on the multiplicity of truths as found in Jain Anekantavada. The incorrect pairing of Anekantavada with Buddhism acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar yet distinct philosophical viewpoints.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the two major schools of Jainism:**

1.  Digambara monks traditionally adhere to complete nudity, while Svetambara monks wear simple white clothing.
2.  Both Digambara and Svetambara sects observe the five vows of Jainism: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, and Brahmacharya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The distinct attire of Digambara and Svetambara monks reflects a fundamental difference in their monastic practices. Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity, symbolizing their renunciation of worldly attachments. Svetambara monks, on the other hand, wear simple white garments. This statement assesses the candidate's knowledge of the observable differences between the two major Jain sects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both sects strive to uphold the principles of Jainism, only the Digambaras strictly follow all five vows.  Svetambaras traditionally emphasize the first four vows (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha), with Brahmacharya (chaste living) being less strictly enforced in lay practice.  The seemingly straightforward statement regarding the five vows serves as a clever distractor, testing the candidate's nuanced understanding of Jain practices and their variations across sects.


**5. With reference to the Sallekhana practice in Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana involves the voluntary fasting unto death, gradually reducing food and liquid intake.
2.  Sallekhana is considered suicide by both Jain scholars and secular legal systems in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sallekhana, a practice within Jainism, involves the deliberate and gradual cessation of food and water intake, leading to death. It is viewed by many Jain followers as a means to achieve spiritual liberation under specific circumstances and with strict adherence to religious guidelines.  This statement directly tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific Jain practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there have been legal challenges and debates surrounding Sallekhana, Jain scholars generally do not consider it suicide. They argue that it is a conscious and deliberate act of self-control, performed for spiritual reasons rather than out of despair or self-harm.  Secular legal systems in India have had varying stances on the practice, with some seeking to regulate or prohibit it. The discrepancy between Jain and secular interpretations provides a significant point of confusion for the candidate, testing their understanding of the complex intersection of religious practice and legal frameworks.


**6. With reference to the Jain Tirthankaras, consider the following statements:**

1. Rishabhanatha is considered the first Tirthankara in Jain tradition.
2. Mahavira is considered the 23rd Tirthankara, while Parshvanatha is the 24th.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rishabhanatha is universally acknowledged as the first Tirthankara in Jain cosmology.  This statement tests basic factual recall concerning Jain religious figures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The order is reversed. Mahavira is the 24th and last Tirthankara, while Parshvanatha is the 23rd.  This subtle inversion of the order of the last two Tirthankaras serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the Jain lineage of Tirthankaras.  The question highlights the importance of accurate recall in understanding the historical development of Jainism.



**7. With reference to the  Swastika symbol in Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swastika in the Jain flag symbolizes the four states of existence for the soul: deities, humans, animals/plants, and hell beings.
2. The three dots above the Swastika represent the Triratna: Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Swastika within the Jain flag is indeed symbolic of the four possible states of existence for the soul, representing the cyclical nature of existence and the possibility of karmic progression or regression. This is a key element of Jain cosmology, testing the candidate's understanding of its symbolic representation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The three dots above the Swastika represent the Ratnatraya (Three Jewels) – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – the path to liberation in Jainism.  This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of the core principles of Jain ethics and spiritual practice.  Both statements, being correct, assess different aspects of Jain symbolism and beliefs.


**8. With reference to the sub-sects within Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Terapanthi sect, a sub-sect of the Digambara school, strictly adheres to vegetarianism and avoids all forms of idol worship.
2. The Sthanakvasi sect, a sub-sect of the Svetambara school, emphasizes reverence for the Tirthankaras but does not engage in idol worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Terapanthis are a Digambara sub-sect and are strictly vegetarian, they *do* engage in idol worship, albeit with some specific practices and preferences that distinguish them from other Digambara groups.  This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the internal variations within Jain sects, highlighting the complexity of sectarian distinctions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sthanakvasi sect, a sub-sect of the Svetambara school, is known for its rejection of idol worship in temples, preferring instead to focus on the teachings and examples of the Tirthankaras and other revered figures.  This statement assesses the candidate's knowledge of another major Jain sub-sect and its distinctive practices.  The contrast between the two statements highlights the diversity of practices within Jainism.


**9. With reference to Buddhist schools, consider the following statements:**

1. Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the attainment of Nirvana through individual practice of the Eightfold Path, while Mahayana Buddhism focuses on achieving Buddhahood to benefit all beings.
2. Vajrayana Buddhism, a branch of Mahayana, incorporates Tantric practices, including the use of mantras and yantras, as a means to accelerate the path to enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Theravada Buddhism emphasizes individual practice and the attainment of personal Nirvana through the Eightfold Path. Mahayana Buddhism, in contrast, emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, where one delays personal enlightenment to help all beings achieve liberation. This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the core differences in the ultimate goals of these two major Buddhist schools.

Statement 2 is also correct. Vajrayana Buddhism, often referred to as Tantric Buddhism, incorporates advanced practices like mantras and yantras to accelerate the path to enlightenment.  This statement assesses the candidate's knowledge of a specific branch of Mahayana Buddhism and its distinctive practices.  Both statements, being correct, highlight the diversity of approaches to spiritual practice within Buddhism.


**10. With reference to  Buddhist Councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Buddhist Council, held in Rajgriha, primarily focused on the standardization and recitation of the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines monastic rules.
2.  The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of King Kanishka, resulted in the definitive division of Buddhism into Hinayana and Mahayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, primarily focused on the standardization and recitation of the Vinaya Pitaka, the collection of monastic rules.  This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of a key event in early Buddhist history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Fourth Buddhist Council, held under King Kanishka, was an important period of Buddhist development, the definitive split between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism had already occurred before this council.  The council itself contributed to the development and codification of Mahayana thought, but it didn't directly cause the division. The misrepresentation of the Fourth Council's role serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the historical evolution of Buddhist schools.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core tenet of Jainism, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, asserting that no single perspective can fully encompass reality.
2.  The concept of "Ratnatraya" (three jewels) in Jainism comprises Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, forming the path to liberation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core principle of Anekantavada in Jain philosophy.  This doctrine rejects the notion of a single, absolute truth, instead emphasizing the existence of multiple perspectives and viewpoints, all potentially valid within their context. This concept is central to Jain epistemology and ethics, promoting tolerance and understanding of diverse opinions.  The complexity of reality, according to Anekantavada, necessitates a comprehensive understanding encompassing various viewpoints before arriving at a complete truth.

Statement 2 correctly describes the "Ratnatraya" (three jewels) in Jainism.  These three principles – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) – are fundamental to the Jain path to liberation (moksha). Right Faith involves a genuine acceptance of Jain teachings and principles. Right Knowledge implies understanding the true nature of reality, including the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and the path to liberation. Right Conduct emphasizes ethical behavior, including the practice of non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness, and non-stealing.  The harmonious integration of these three jewels constitutes the path to spiritual progress and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the teachings of Mahavira, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, advocated for strict asceticism and moral cultivation, emphasizing the renunciation of worldly desires as a path to liberation.
2.  Mahavira's teachings included the concept of "Triratna," comprising Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, as the pathway to overcoming negative karma and achieving salvation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key aspect of Mahavira's teachings.  He strongly emphasized the importance of asceticism and moral discipline as essential components of the path to liberation (moksha). This involved renouncing material possessions, sensual pleasures, and worldly attachments to achieve spiritual purity and freedom from the cycle of rebirth.  His emphasis on rigorous self-discipline and ethical conduct is a defining feature of Jain monastic life.

Statement 2 is incorrect in its attribution. While the "Triratna" (three jewels) – Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct – are indeed central to Jainism, they are not specifically attributed to Mahavira's individual teachings. This concept represents the core principles of the Jain path to liberation, which evolved over time and were not solely introduced by Mahavira. The Triratna represents a culmination of Jain philosophical thought, built upon the teachings of previous Tirthankaras and further developed after Mahavira's time. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the different schools of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the attainment of Nirvana through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, focusing on individual liberation from suffering.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism, unlike Theravada, promotes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to assist others in achieving liberation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a central tenet of Theravada Buddhism.  This school emphasizes the individual's journey towards Nirvana, achieved through diligent practice of the Noble Eightfold Path—right understanding, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.  The focus is on personal liberation from the cycle of suffering (samsara) through self-cultivation and ethical conduct.  Theravada Buddhism maintains a strong emphasis on monastic life and adherence to the original teachings of the Buddha as preserved in the Pali Canon.

Statement 2 correctly highlights a key distinction between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.  The Bodhisattva ideal, a central concept in Mahayana, emphasizes the postponement of one's own Nirvana to dedicate oneself to the liberation of all sentient beings.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who choose to remain in the cycle of samsara to help others achieve enlightenment. This altruistic ideal contrasts with the Theravada emphasis on individual liberation, demonstrating a significant difference in the ultimate goals and paths of these two major Buddhist traditions. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**4. With reference to the two major sects within Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity, while Svetambara monks wear simple white clothing.
2.  Svetambara Jainism adheres to the four restraints (excluding Brahmacharya), whereas Digambara Jainism strictly follows all five restraints as taught by Mahavira.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a significant difference in monastic practices between the Digambara and Svetambara sects of Jainism.  Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity as a symbol of renunciation and detachment from worldly possessions.  This practice reflects their stricter adherence to ascetic ideals.  In contrast, Svetambara monks wear simple white clothing, indicating a less stringent approach to asceticism. This difference in monastic attire visually represents the divergent interpretations of Jain principles within the two sects.

Statement 2 also highlights a key distinction in the ethical codes followed by the two sects.  While both sects emphasize the importance of the five great vows (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, and Brahmacharya), the Svetambara sect traditionally emphasizes the observance of the first four vows, with Brahmacharya (chastity) being less strictly enforced for lay practitioners. The Digambara sect, however, maintains a stricter interpretation of all five vows, reflecting their more rigorous ascetic practices.  Thus, both statements accurately reflect differences between the two major Jain sects.


**5. With reference to Jain cosmology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jain cosmology depicts the universe as having multiple layers, including the realms of gods, humans, animals, and hellish beings, with the soul's progression or regression influenced by karma.
2.  The Siddhashila, depicted in Jain iconography, symbolizes the eternal abode of Arihants (those who have achieved liberation) and Siddhas (liberated souls) at the apex of the universe.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of Jain cosmology.  Jain cosmology describes a complex, multi-layered universe consisting of various realms or lokas. These include the higher realms inhabited by gods (Devas), the human realm (Manushya loka), the animal and plant realms (Naraka), and the lower realms of hellish beings (Naraka).  The soul's journey through these realms is determined by its karma, with good karma leading to upward progression and bad karma resulting in downward movement. This cyclical movement within the cosmos is a central theme in Jain philosophy.

Statement 2 correctly explains the symbolic significance of Siddhashila in Jain iconography.  Siddhashila represents the highest point in the Jain cosmos, the eternal abode of Arihants (those who have attained liberation by overcoming all karma) and Siddhas (liberated souls).  This celestial realm is depicted as a place of ultimate bliss and freedom from the cycle of rebirth, serving as a powerful visual representation of the ultimate goal in Jain spiritual practice.  The depiction of Siddhashila often accompanies other symbols like the Swastika and the three jewels (Ratnatraya), reinforcing the core principles of Jain faith and the ultimate aim of liberation.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**6. With reference to  the concept of Sallekhana in Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. Sallekhana involves the voluntary cessation of food and water intake, leading to death, and is considered a form of suicide by most legal authorities.
2.  Jain scholars generally do not consider Sallekhana to be suicide, as it is undertaken with a deliberate and conscious choice devoid of self-destructive impulses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 reflects the common legal and societal perception of Sallekhana.  Sallekhana, a practice within Jainism, involves the conscious and gradual cessation of food and water intake, ultimately leading to death.  Many legal systems consider this a form of suicide due to its intentional nature and outcome.  This is a significant point of contention between the practice and the legal frameworks that govern it, leading to ongoing debates and legal challenges.

Statement 2 accurately represents the Jain perspective on Sallekhana.  Jain scholars generally view Sallekhana as a form of self-liberation or a ritualistic ending of life, not suicide.  They argue that it is performed not out of despair or self-destruction, but with complete awareness and acceptance, as a means to attain spiritual purification and release from the cycle of birth and death.  The practice is typically undertaken by ascetics or lay practitioners facing terminal illnesses or old age, with the aim of achieving a peaceful and controlled transition.  The two statements, while seemingly contradictory, highlight the differing perspectives on Sallekhana – the legal view versus the religious interpretation.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**7. With reference to the  Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain Agamas are considered sacred texts containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras and are primarily written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit.
2.  The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi during the mid-5th century AD, while the Svetambara sect rejects their authenticity.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Jain Agamas and their linguistic context. The Jain Agamas are a collection of sacred texts believed to contain the teachings of the Tirthankaras (spiritual leaders) of Jainism.  These texts are considered authoritative scriptures within the Jain tradition.  The primary language of the Agamas is Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, an ancient Indian language closely related to Pali and Sanskrit.  The Agamas are divided into several categories (Angas, Upangas, etc.), encompassing a wide range of topics, including cosmology, ethics, metaphysics, and spiritual practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect in its description of the sectarian views on the Agamas.  It's the Svetambara sect that accepts the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi, while the Digambara sect largely rejects their authenticity, believing that the original teachings were lost long ago. This difference in acceptance of the canonical texts highlights a significant divergence in the doctrinal and scriptural traditions of the two major Jain sects. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**8. With reference to  the  Svetambara and Digambara sects of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Svetambara sect permits the worship of Tirthankara images, while the Digambara sect generally prohibits idol worship.
2.  The Sthanakvasi sect, a sub-sect within Svetambara Jainism, emphasizes the veneration of saints and avoids the use of idols in temples.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key difference in religious practice between the Svetambara and Digambara sects.  Svetambara Jainism generally permits the worship of Tirthankara images in temples.  These images serve as focal points for devotion and meditation, representing the perfected souls who have attained liberation.  In contrast, Digambara Jainism largely prohibits idol worship, emphasizing instead the focus on self-discipline, meditation, and the pursuit of spiritual perfection without reliance on material representations. This difference reflects varying interpretations of Jain principles and the emphasis placed on different aspects of religious practice.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Sthanakvasi sect, a significant sub-sect within Svetambara Jainism. The Sthanakvasi  emphasize the veneration of the Tirthankaras but not through idol worship, focusing instead on the spiritual teachings and the exemplary lives of Jain saints.  They do not typically have idols in their temples. This emphasis on the teachings and the lives of saints as sources of inspiration and guidance distinguishes the Sthanakvasi from other Svetambara sub-sects that engage in more traditional forms of idol worship. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the practices and beliefs within the different Jain sects.


**9.  Consider the following statements about  the  eight auspicious symbols (Ashtamangala) in Svetambara Jainism:**

1.  The Swastika, one of the Ashtamangala, symbolizes the embodiment of the soul in its various forms (deities, humans, animals, hell beings), with its progression or degradation determined by karma.
2.  The Nandavarta, another Ashtamangala symbol, is a large swastika with nine endpoints, associated with the 18th Tirthankara, Aranatha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the symbolism of the Swastika within the context of Svetambara Jainism.  The Swastika, one of the eight auspicious symbols (Ashtamangala), represents the soul's journey through different realms of existence. It symbolizes the soul's potential to exist in various forms—as deities, humans, animals, or hellish beings—with its progression or regression determined by its karma. This depiction of the Swastika reflects the Jain concept of the soul's cyclical journey through the universe and the importance of ethical conduct in shaping its destiny.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Nandavarta symbol and its association with a particular Tirthankara. The Nandavarta is another of the eight auspicious symbols (Ashtamangala) within Svetambara Jainism.  It is depicted as a large Swastika with nine endpoints or turns.  This symbol is specifically associated with the 18th Tirthankara, Aranatha, further highlighting its importance within the Jain tradition.  The specific details of these symbols and their associations with particular Tirthankaras are significant aspects of Jain iconography and religious practice.  Therefore, both statements are correct.



**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Anekantavada emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, rejecting absolutism.
2.  The five vows (Mahavratas) of Jainism include Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, and Aparigraha, with Brahmacharya being added by Mahavira.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, asserts that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives.  No single viewpoint can fully encompass the truth, emphasizing the limitations of absolutist claims. This concept encourages tolerance and understanding of diverse viewpoints.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the five principles of Jainism (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, and Brahmacharya) are indeed central, the statement misrepresents the contribution of Mahavira.  While Mahavira strongly emphasized these principles and their rigorous practice,  the concept of Brahmacharya (chaste living) existed in earlier forms of Jainism, predating Mahavira.  He didn't *add* it, but rather reinforced its importance within the context of his teachings. The five vows are often referred to as Mahavratas (Great Vows) for ascetics, while lay practitioners follow Anuvratas (lesser vows).


**2. With reference to the Triratna of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Triratna comprises the Buddha, Dhamma (teachings), and Sangha (community), with Sangha being initiated at Buddha's first sermon.
2.  The concept of Nirvana, the ultimate goal in Buddhism, is the attainment of a state free from suffering and the cycle of rebirth, achieved primarily through the Eightfold Path.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Triratna (Three Jewels) are fundamental to Buddhist practice and belief. They represent the Buddha (the enlightened one), Dhamma (his teachings and the path to enlightenment), and Sangha (the monastic community and those following the path). The Sangha, as a formal community of practitioners, was indeed established following the Buddha's first sermon at Sarnath, marking the beginning of the Buddhist monastic order.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nirvana is the ultimate goal in Buddhism, representing liberation from suffering (dukkha) and the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara).  The Eightfold Path, encompassing ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom, provides the practical framework for achieving this liberation.  While other paths and practices exist within different schools of Buddhism, the Eightfold Path remains central to the attainment of Nirvana.


**3. With reference to the schools of Buddhist philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hinayana Buddhism emphasizes individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation, rejecting idol worship, while Mahayana Buddhism embraces the concept of Bodhisattvas and universal salvation.
2.  Theravada Buddhism, considered a successor to Hinayana, uses the Pali Canon as its doctrinal core, focusing on the Noble Eightfold Path and the attainment of Nirvana through the practice of Samatha and Vipassana meditation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately contrasts Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. Hinayana (meaning "lesser vehicle"), while a term now considered somewhat outdated and potentially pejorative by some, historically emphasized individual enlightenment through practices like meditation and adherence to monastic discipline.  It generally avoided the image worship prevalent in Mahayana. Mahayana ("greater vehicle") broadened the scope to include the concept of Bodhisattvas—enlightened beings who delay their own Nirvana to assist others in achieving enlightenment—and thus emphasized universal salvation.

Statement 2 correctly describes Theravada Buddhism.  Often seen as the continuation of the older traditions associated with Hinayana, Theravada relies heavily on the Pali Canon (the oldest surviving collection of Buddhist texts) for its doctrines. The Noble Eightfold Path is central to its path to Nirvana, with the practices of Samatha (calm abiding meditation) and Vipassana (insight meditation) forming integral components.


**4. With reference to the Jain Tirthankaras, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, is often mistakenly considered the founder of Jainism, while Rishabhanatha is considered the first Tirthankara.
2.  The 24 Tirthankaras, including figures like Parshvanatha and Mahavira, are believed to have attained Kevala Jnana (perfect knowledge) and shown the path to liberation (moksha).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Mahavira is the most well-known figure in Jainism due to his significant contribution to its organization and dissemination, Jain tradition holds that he was the 24th Tirthankara, not the founder.  The lineage of Tirthankaras extends back to Rishabhanatha, considered the first.  This highlights the cyclical nature of Jain cosmology and the belief in the periodic appearance of enlightened teachers.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 24 Tirthankaras are central to Jain cosmology and belief. Each is believed to have attained Kevala Jnana (perfect knowledge), complete liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara), and thus demonstrated the path to Moksha.  Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankara, laid the foundation for many of Mahavira's teachings, emphasizing the importance of Ahimsa (non-violence).


**5. With reference to the Digambara and Svetambara sects of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity, while Svetambara monks wear simple white clothing.  The Svetambara sect also believes women can attain Tirthankara status.
2.  Both sects accept the authority of the Jain Agamas, a collection of sacred texts considered to be the teachings of the Tirthankaras, although there are some differences in which texts are considered authoritative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key difference between the Digambara and Svetambara sects. Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity as a symbol of renunciation, while Svetambara monks wear simple white clothes.  Furthermore, the Svetambara sect accepts the possibility of women achieving Tirthankara status, a distinction from the Digambara sect's view.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both sects acknowledge the importance of the Agamas, the Digambara sect does *not* accept the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi (Gujarat) during the 5th century CE.  They believe that the original Agamas were lost, leading to differing canonical texts and interpretations of Jain scripture between the two sects.  This difference in canonical authority underlines a significant divergence in their theological perspectives.


**6. With reference to the Charvaka school of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Charvaka school, also known as Lokayata, is a materialistic philosophy that emphasizes sensory experience as the sole source of knowledge and rejects the concept of an afterlife.
2.  The Charvaka school advocates for hedonism, emphasizing the pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment as the ultimate goal of life, while rejecting the authority of the Vedas and the existence of a divine creator.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core tenets of Charvaka philosophy.  It is a staunchly materialistic school of thought, emphasizing the primacy of sensory experience (pratyakṣa) as the only reliable source of knowledge.  It rejects metaphysical concepts like the soul, rebirth, and an afterlife, focusing solely on the tangible and observable world.

Statement 2 is also correct in its description of Charvaka hedonism.  The school advocates for a life focused on the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain (hedonism), viewing this as the most rational approach to life.  This is coupled with a rejection of Vedic authority and the belief in a creator god, underscoring its distinct departure from orthodox Indian philosophical traditions.  The famous aphorism "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" summarizes their stance.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy:**

1.  The Samkhya school, founded by Kapila, posits a dualistic reality of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter), with liberation achieved through self-knowledge.
2.  The Nyaya school, founded by Gautama, emphasizes logic and reasoning as the means to attain salvation, while the Vaisheshika school, founded by Kanada, focuses on the physical world and atomic theory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Samkhya school.  Founded by Kapila, it is a dualistic system that distinguishes between Purusha (pure consciousness, the self) and Prakriti (the material world, nature).  Liberation (moksha) is achieved through the realization of the distinction between these two, leading to the cessation of identification with the material world.

Statement 2 also correctly portrays the Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools.  The Nyaya school, founded by Gautama, emphasizes logic (nyaya) and epistemology (the study of knowledge) as the means to understand reality and achieve liberation.  The Vaisheshika school, founded by Kanada, focuses on metaphysics and physics, particularly the atomic theory (paramāṇu) and its role in the constitution of the physical world. Both contributed to the development of logic and scientific inquiry in ancient India.


**8. With reference to the concept of Bodhisattva in Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bodhisattva path is primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism, where individuals postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.  Prominent Bodhisattvas include Avalokiteshvara (Padmapani), Vajrapani, and Manjusri.
2.  In Theravada Buddhism, the focus is on individual enlightenment and the attainment of Arhatship, a state of liberation, rather than the Bodhisattva path, which is less emphasized.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Bodhisattva path as a central concept within Mahayana Buddhism.  The Bodhisattva ideal emphasizes selfless compassion and the postponement of one's own Nirvana to help all sentient beings achieve enlightenment.  Avalokiteshvara (often depicted holding a lotus flower, hence the name Padmapani), Vajrapani (associated with power), and Manjusri (associated with wisdom) are among the most well-known Bodhisattvas.

Statement 2 also accurately describes the Theravada perspective.  While the concept of Bodhisattvas exists within Theravada, it holds less prominence than in Mahayana.  The primary focus in Theravada is on the individual's attainment of Arhatship—a state of enlightenment and liberation—through the practice of the Eightfold Path, with less emphasis on the altruistic ideal of the Bodhisattva.  This difference reflects the distinct approaches to the Buddhist path in the two traditions.


**9. With reference to  the  Jain  philosophy's  concept of the soul, consider the following statements:**

1. Jain philosophy emphasizes the soul (Atman) as the fundamental essence of a being, experiencing existence and gaining knowledge independently of the mind and body.
2.  The Jain concept of Karma involves the attachment of karmic particles to the soul, leading to rebirth and suffering.  Liberation (moksha) is achieved by shedding these karmic particles through rigorous practice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Jain view of the soul (Atman). Jainism firmly believes in the existence of the soul, considering it the fundamental and enduring essence of a being. Unlike some other Indian philosophies, Jainism asserts that the soul is an independent entity, capable of experiencing existence and acquiring knowledge without being wholly dependent on the mind or body.  This is a significant distinction from Buddhist philosophy.

Statement 2 is equally correct in its description of Karma within Jain philosophy.  Jain cosmology posits that karmic particles (karma) attach themselves to the soul, influencing its experiences and leading to rebirth and suffering.  The goal of Jain practice—the attainment of Moksha or liberation—is to shed these karmic particles through rigorous ascetic practices, ethical conduct, and spiritual disciplines. This process of purification is central to Jain spiritual life.


**10. With reference to the  Jain  Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jain Agamas are a collection of sacred texts considered to be the teachings of the Tirthankaras, primarily written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit.
2. The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi during the 5th century CE, while the Svetambara sect has a different set of canonical texts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jain Agamas are indeed a collection of sacred texts considered to be the teachings of the Tirthankaras. These texts are primarily written in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, an ancient Prakrit language.  They contain a wide range of teachings on cosmology, ethics, metaphysics, and spiritual practice, providing the foundational scriptures for Jainism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  As previously mentioned, the Digambara sect *rejects* the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi in the 5th century CE.  They believe the original texts were lost, and thus their canonical texts differ significantly from those accepted by the Svetambara sect.  This divergence in canonical authority is a key distinction between the two major Jain sects.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization exhibited a sophisticated urban planning system, evident in the grid-like layouts of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
2.  Evidence suggests the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during the Harappan period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological excavations at major Harappan sites reveal a remarkable level of urban planning.  The cities were laid out in a grid pattern with well-planned streets, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes, showcasing advanced engineering and societal organization for its time. This sophisticated urban planning is a hallmark of the civilization and distinguishes it from its predecessors.  The precision and scale of the urban planning demonstrate a high degree of centralized control and societal organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Harappan Civilization possessed domesticated animals like cattle and possibly donkeys, there's currently no conclusive archaeological evidence supporting the widespread use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare during that period.  While horse remains have been found in some later Harappan contexts, the evidence is not definitive enough to establish their widespread use in warfare during the main phase of the civilization. The lack of clear depictions or remains of chariots in Harappan art and settlements contrasts with the extensive evidence of sophisticated urban planning and other technological achievements.  Further research is needed to confirm the role and prevalence of horses and chariots in Harappan society.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the concept of Bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone their own Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment.
2.  The concept of "Sunyata" (emptiness) is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism, emphasizing the impermanent nature of all phenomena.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bodhisattva ideal is a cornerstone of Mahayana Buddhism.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, despite achieving enlightenment, choose to remain in the cycle of samsara to assist other sentient beings in attaining Buddhahood.  This selfless dedication to the welfare of others is a defining characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism and distinguishes it from Theravada Buddhism, which focuses more on individual enlightenment.  The Bodhisattva path is seen as a higher path to enlightenment, emphasizing compassion and altruism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sunyata, or emptiness, is a fundamental concept in Mahayana Buddhism, particularly within the Madhyamaka school. It doesn't imply nihilism but rather signifies the lack of inherent self or independent existence in all phenomena.  Everything is interconnected and interdependent, arising and ceasing in a constant flux. This understanding of impermanence and interdependence is crucial in Mahayana philosophy for overcoming attachment and suffering.  The concept of Sunyata has had a profound influence on Mahayana Buddhist thought and practice.



**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire is known for its distinctive style of temple architecture, featuring large, ornate structures with intricate carvings and pillared mandapas.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers actively promoted the development of a unique Dravidian style of painting, characterized by vibrant colours and detailed depictions of courtly life.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire (14th-16th centuries CE) left behind a remarkable architectural legacy. Their temples are characterized by their impressive scale, intricate carvings, and the inclusion of features like Kalyana mandapas (wedding pavilions).  These temples showcase a sophisticated blend of architectural styles, reflecting the empire's diverse influences. The grandeur and artistic detail of these structures are a testament to the empire's power and artistic patronage. Examples like the Vittala Temple complex at Hampi are globally renowned for their architectural significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara period saw artistic flourishing, it's not primarily known for a distinct Dravidian painting style.  Although painting existed during this period,  the stylistic evolution and patronage differed from the clear development of distinct schools of painting seen in other regions of India during that time, such as the Rajput or Deccan schools. The available evidence does not support the notion of a unique and dominant Vijayanagara Dravidian painting style.  Further research is needed to fully understand the artistic landscape of the Vijayanagara Empire.



**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar is known for his religious tolerance and his attempts to synthesize various religious beliefs, as reflected in his establishment of the Ibadat Khana.
2.  The Mughal emperors, particularly Jahangir and Shah Jahan, are renowned for their patronage of miniature painting, creating a distinct style characterized by realism and detailed depictions of courtly life and nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar’s reign (1556-1605 CE) is notable for his policy of religious tolerance and his attempts at religious synthesis. The Ibadat Khana, a house of worship, was established as a place for intellectual discussions and debates among scholars of different faiths, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.  This reflects Akbar’s interest in diverse religious perspectives and his efforts to foster religious harmony within his empire.  His policies, while not always uniformly successful, significantly impacted religious dynamics in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal emperors were major patrons of the arts, and miniature painting reached new heights under their rule.  Jahangir and Shah Jahan, in particular, fostered a style characterized by its realism, attention to detail, and vibrant colors.  Mughal miniature paintings depict courtly life, portraits of emperors and nobles, scenes of hunting and warfare, and detailed depictions of flora and fauna.  These paintings demonstrate a high level of artistic skill and provide valuable insights into Mughal court life and culture.  The Mughal style significantly influenced later Indian painting traditions.



**5. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti Movement emphasized personal devotion to a chosen deity, transcending caste distinctions and promoting a more inclusive religious experience.
2.  The Bhakti saints primarily composed their works in Sanskrit, ensuring their message reached a wide audience across different regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti Movement (14th-18th centuries CE) was a significant socio-religious reform movement in India.  It emphasized bhakti, or intense personal devotion to a chosen deity, often Krishna or Rama. This emphasis on personal faith and devotion challenged the rigid caste system and promoted a more inclusive religious experience, accessible to people from all social backgrounds.  The Bhakti saints used vernacular languages to reach wider audiences, conveying their message of love and devotion in a relatable way.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some Bhakti saints might have used Sanskrit, the movement's strength lay in its use of vernacular languages – Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi and others.  This enabled them to connect with a broader segment of the population, transcending linguistic barriers and making their message accessible to the masses. The use of vernacular languages was crucial in expanding the reach and impact of the Bhakti Movement.  The saints' use of readily understandable languages played a key role in their success in spreading their message across various regions of India.


**6. With reference to  Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles represent three distinct regional architectural traditions in India, each with its own unique features and characteristics.
2.  The construction of temples in India was solely influenced by religious beliefs and practices, with no significant impact from secular or political factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Indian temple architecture displays a rich diversity of styles, with the Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles representing three major regional traditions.  The Nagara style is predominantly found in North India, characterized by its curvilinear shikharas (towers). The Dravida style, prevalent in South India, features pyramidal towers. The Vesara style represents a blend of Nagara and Dravida elements, found in regions like Karnataka.  These styles reflect not only religious preferences but also local materials, craftsmanship, and cultural influences. The distinct regional styles represent a significant aspect of India's architectural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While religious beliefs and practices were undoubtedly the primary drivers behind temple construction, secular and political factors also played a significant role.  Royal patronage, economic conditions, and political power dynamics significantly influenced the scale, location, and design of temples.  Temples often served not only as places of worship but also as centers of community life, economic activity, and political power.  The construction of large and elaborate temples often served as a demonstration of royal power and wealth.  Therefore, the assertion that religious factors were the sole influence is an oversimplification.


**7.  With reference to the  Ajanta Caves, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta Caves are renowned for their exquisite murals, depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and showcasing the mastery of ancient Indian painting techniques.
2.  The Ajanta Caves were exclusively built and used by Buddhist monks for meditation and religious practices; there is no evidence of any other use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra are globally famous for their breathtaking murals. These paintings, executed in the vibrant colors and sophisticated techniques of ancient Indian art, depict scenes from the Jataka tales—stories of the Buddha's past lives—and other Buddhist themes.  They are considered masterpieces of ancient Indian art, showcasing the skill and artistry of the painters. The murals' preservation offers invaluable insights into the artistic and religious life of the period. The stylistic sophistication and narrative richness of the Ajanta murals make them a significant cultural heritage site.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta Caves primarily served as a Buddhist monastic complex,  it's inaccurate to say they were *exclusively* used for meditation and religious practices.  Archaeological evidence suggests the caves also served other purposes, possibly including temporary shelter for travelers or pilgrims.  The caves' multi-purpose functionality is a plausible interpretation, given the location and historical context. It would be an oversimplification to limit their function solely to the religious practices of Buddhist monks.  The caves' varied uses reflect the broader social and cultural dynamics of the region.


**8. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization had a well-developed system of standardized weights and measures, suggesting a high degree of economic organization and trade networks.
2. The Indus Valley Civilization's script has been fully deciphered, revealing detailed information about their social structures, religious beliefs, and political organization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indus Valley Civilization is notable for its remarkably standardized weights and measures.  Archaeological findings consistently reveal the use of uniform weights and scales across a vast geographical area, suggesting a well-organized system of trade and economic interaction.  This standardization facilitated efficient trade and economic transactions across the civilization's extensive network. The precision of the weights and measures indicates a sophisticated understanding of measurement and its importance in economic life.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The script of the Indus Valley Civilization remains undeciphered. While numerous inscriptions have been found on seals, pottery, and other artifacts, their meaning remains unknown.  The unique nature of the script and the lack of a Rosetta Stone-like parallel text have hindered decipherment efforts.  Although researchers continue to work on deciphering this script, currently, no consensus exists on its meaning, making any statements about the civilization's social, religious, or political systems based on the script purely speculative.  The undeciphered script remains one of the major unsolved mysteries of the Indus Valley Civilization.


**9. With reference to the  rock-cut architecture of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar Caves in Bihar are among the earliest examples of rock-cut cave architecture in India, showcasing the sophisticated rock-cutting techniques of the Mauryan period.
2. The Ellora Caves, known for their intricate carvings and diverse religious representations, were constructed during the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar Caves, located in Bihar, represent some of the earliest surviving examples of rock-cut cave architecture in India.  These caves, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), demonstrate remarkable skill in rock-cutting techniques.  Their construction showcases the advanced engineering and craftsmanship of the time.  The Barabar Caves are significant for their architectural style and the historical insights they provide into early Indian rock-cut architecture.  The precision and scale of the rock-cutting are particularly noteworthy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ellora Caves, famous for their diverse religious iconography (Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain), were not constructed during the Gupta period.  While the Gupta period (4th-6th centuries CE) witnessed significant artistic and architectural development, the Ellora Caves' construction spanned a much longer period, with significant work occurring during the Rashtrakuta period (8th-10th centuries CE).  Attributing their construction solely to the Gupta period is an oversimplification and an inaccurate historical claim.  The diverse religious representations in the Ellora Caves reflect the religious tolerance and cultural syncretism of the period.


**10. With reference to the  development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school of art, known for its Greco-Buddhist style, flourished during the Kushana period, blending Indian artistic traditions with Hellenistic influences.
2. The Ajanta Caves' murals are primarily representative of the Pala style of painting, characterized by its emphasis on detailed figures and narrative scenes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gandhara school of art, which flourished during the Kushana empire (1st-3rd centuries CE), is a significant example of artistic syncretism.  It combined Indian Buddhist iconography with Hellenistic artistic styles, resulting in a unique blend of artistic traditions.  The Gandhara sculptures, particularly the depictions of the Buddha, are characterized by their Greco-Roman features, such as realistic portrayal and drapery styles.  This fusion of styles reflects the cultural exchange and interaction between India and the Greco-Roman world during this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The murals at the Ajanta Caves are not primarily representative of the Pala style. The Pala style flourished much later, primarily in eastern India during the Pala dynasty (8th-12th centuries CE).  The Ajanta murals, dating from the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE, showcase a distinct style that evolved over time, reflecting different artistic influences and artistic preferences of different periods.  Ascribing the Ajanta murals to the Pala style is a significant anachronism.  The Ajanta murals are considered masterpieces of ancient Indian painting, showcasing a unique blend of styles and techniques.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain philosophy emphasizes the concept of Anekantavada, which posits that reality is multifaceted and possesses multiple perspectives.
2.  The three jewels (Triratna) of Jainism—Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct—are symbolized by three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, asserts that reality is complex and possesses multiple, equally valid perspectives.  It rejects the notion of a single, absolute truth, emphasizing the limitations of human perception and understanding in grasping the entirety of existence.  This principle underscores the importance of tolerance and respect for diverse viewpoints.

Statement 2 is also correct. The three dots above the Swastika on the Jain flag indeed represent the Triratna – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Gyan), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra). These three principles form the foundation of Jain spiritual practice and guide adherents towards liberation (moksha). The Swastika itself symbolizes the cyclical nature of existence and the soul's journey.  Therefore, the combination of the Swastika and the three dots encapsulates a central tenet of Jain cosmology and ethics.


**2. With reference to Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara sect of Jainism permits women to attain the status of Tirthankara, while the Svetambara sect does not.
2.  Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered a form of suicide by both the Digambara and Svetambara sects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Digambara sect of Jainism does *not* believe women can be Tirthankaras. This is a key difference between the Digambara and Svetambara sects.  The Svetambara sect, however, does allow for the possibility of female Tirthankaras.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Sallekhana, while a controversial practice, is not universally considered suicide within Jainism.  While some may interpret it as such, many Jains view it as a means of achieving liberation from the cycle of rebirth through self-control and detachment, not as an act of self-destruction driven by despair or other negative emotions.  The legal status of Sallekhana has also been debated in modern courts.


**3. With reference to the evolution of Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sarvastivada school of Buddhism emerged as a sub-sect within the Mahasamghika school.
2.  The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, is considered a sub-school of Mahayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sarvastivada school was a significant early Buddhist school that emerged from the Sthavira Nikaya, not from the Mahasamghika school.  These were distinct early branches of Buddhism, diverging in their interpretations of Buddhist doctrine and practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Madhyamaka school, a pivotal school within Mahayana Buddhism, was indeed founded by Nagarjuna.  His philosophy of Sunyata (emptiness) profoundly influenced Mahayana thought and continues to be a significant area of study within Buddhist philosophy.  The Madhyamaka school's focus on emptiness challenges conventional notions of self and reality.


**4. With reference to Buddhist philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Bodhisattva is central to Theravada Buddhism, emphasizing individual enlightenment and the renunciation of worldly attachments.
2.  The Four Noble Truths – Dukkha, Samudaya, Nirodha, and Magga – form the foundational tenets of Buddhist philosophy, irrespective of school or sect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bodhisattva ideal, representing the aspiration to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, is primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism, not Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism emphasizes the path to individual Nirvana through personal practice and adherence to the Eightfold Path.

Statement 2 is correct. The Four Noble Truths are indeed the foundational elements of Buddhist thought, accepted across various schools and sects.  They provide a framework for understanding the nature of suffering, its origins, its cessation, and the path to liberation.  While different schools may interpret these truths differently, their fundamental significance remains consistent.


**5. With reference to the Jain Agamas, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain Agamas are considered sacred texts containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras, primarily compiled by the Ganadharas, the chief disciples of Mahavira.
2.  The Digambara sect fully accepts the authority and authenticity of the Jain Agamas compiled in Vallabhi during the mid-5th century AD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jain Agamas are indeed considered sacred scriptures containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras.  They were initially transmitted orally and later compiled, with the Ganadharas playing a crucial role in their preservation and organization.  While the exact process of compilation is subject to scholarly debate, the Agamas are central to Jain religious practice and understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digambara sect does *not* fully accept the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi.  They believe that the original teachings were lost and that the Vallabhi Agamas are later compilations, lacking the same authority as what they consider to be the lost original texts.  This difference in perspective on the Agamas reflects a key divergence between the Digambara and Svetambara sects.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Sunyata (emptiness) is a central tenet of the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, emphasizing the lack of inherent self or essence in all phenomena.
2.  The Yogachara school of Mahayana Buddhism focuses primarily on the cultivation of meditative practices and the transformation of consciousness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, indeed centers on the concept of Sunyata, or emptiness.  This concept challenges the notion of inherent existence or self-nature in all phenomena, arguing that things are empty of inherent existence, although they are not nonexistent. This has profound implications for understanding reality and the nature of self.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Yogachara school, another major Mahayana school, focuses on the mind and the transformative power of meditation.  It emphasizes the role of consciousness in shaping our perception of reality and the potential for cultivating wisdom and compassion through mental discipline and insight.  The Yogachara school is known for its sophisticated analysis of consciousness and its emphasis on the practice of yoga.


**7. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Charvaka school, also known as Lokayata, is a materialistic school that rejects the existence of an afterlife and emphasizes the pursuit of worldly pleasures.
2.  The Buddhist and Jain schools, while both heterodox, share the common ground of rejecting the authority of the Vedas and emphasizing non-violence (ahimsa).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Charvaka (Lokayata) school is indeed a materialistic school of Indian philosophy that rejects the concepts of an afterlife, reincarnation, and the authority of the Vedas. It emphasizes empirical experience and the pursuit of sensual pleasure as the primary goals of human life.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Both Buddhism and Jainism are classified as heterodox schools because they reject the authority of the Vedas, the sacred texts of Hinduism.  Furthermore, both traditions strongly emphasize non-violence (ahimsa) as a core ethical principle. While they differ in their philosophical approaches and specific practices, their shared rejection of Vedic authority and emphasis on non-violence are notable similarities.


**8. With reference to the orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, founded by Kapila, posits a dualistic worldview, distinguishing between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2.  The Nyaya school, founded by Gautama, emphasizes logic and epistemology as the primary means for attaining liberation (moksha).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools, is indeed characterized by its dualistic metaphysics, which distinguishes between Purusha (the pure consciousness, the self) and Prakriti (the primordial matter, the dynamic energy that constitutes the material world).  This distinction forms the basis of Samkhya's understanding of reality and the path to liberation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Nyaya school is renowned for its emphasis on logic and epistemology (the study of knowledge).  It developed a systematic framework for reasoning and understanding the world, using methods such as inference, comparison, and testimony to arrive at valid conclusions.  Nyaya philosophy considered a proper understanding of the world, achieved through rigorous logic, essential for attaining liberation.


**9.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The Svetambara sect of Jainism is characterized by the use of white clothing by its monks, unlike the Digambara sect, which traditionally practices nudity.
2. The concept of  "Ratnatraya" (three jewels) in Jainism consists of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, guiding practitioners towards liberation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key distinction between the two major sects of Jainism, the Svetambara and Digambara, lies in their monastic practices. Svetambara monks wear white clothes, while Digambara monks traditionally practice nudity as a symbol of renunciation. This difference in attire reflects deeper philosophical and ritualistic variations between the two sects.

Statement 2 is also correct. The "Ratnatraya" (three jewels) is a fundamental concept in Jainism, comprising Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra). These three jewels are considered essential for overcoming karma and attaining liberation (moksha).  They represent the path to spiritual purification and the ultimate goal of Jain practice.


**10. With reference to the spread of Indian religions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism to East Asia largely occurred through land routes, notably the Silk Road, facilitating the exchange of religious ideas and cultural practices.
2.  The dissemination of Hinduism to Southeast Asia primarily involved the migration of Indian traders and the establishment of Hindu kingdoms, contributing to the prevalence of Hindu temples and practices in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The spread of Buddhism to East Asia was indeed heavily influenced by the extensive network of land routes, especially the Silk Road.  These routes facilitated the movement of Buddhist monks, scholars, and texts, leading to the establishment of Buddhist communities and the flourishing of Buddhist traditions in countries like China, Korea, and Japan.

Statement 2 is also correct. The spread of Hinduism to Southeast Asia was intricately linked to the maritime activities of Indian traders.  The establishment of Hindu kingdoms and the construction of Hindu temples in regions like Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia are testaments to the significant cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia.  The presence of Hindu religious elements in these regions highlights the influence of Indian culture and religious beliefs.


**1. With reference to the early Buddhist schools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sthavira Nikaya and the Mahasamghika were the two main schools that emerged after the death of the Buddha, with further sub-sects developing later.
2. The Theravada school is considered a direct descendant of the Sthavira Nikaya, emphasizing the Pali Canon and individual enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Following the Parinirvana of the Buddha, the Sangha (monastic order) is believed to have fragmented into two primary schools – the Sthavira Nikaya and the Mahasamghika – between 383 and 250 BCE.  Each of these subsequently branched into numerous sub-sects, reflecting evolving interpretations of Buddhist doctrine and practice. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of early Buddhism and its adaptation to diverse contexts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Theravada school, one of the major surviving branches of Buddhism today, traces its lineage back to the Sthavira Nikaya.  A key characteristic of Theravada Buddhism is its reliance on the Pali Canon, the oldest complete collection of Buddhist scriptures, as its primary doctrinal source. Its emphasis on the individual's path to enlightenment through practices like meditation and the Noble Eightfold Path further distinguishes it.  The historical continuity between the Sthavira Nikaya and Theravada provides crucial insight into the evolution of Buddhist thought.


**2. With reference to Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of Bodhisattvas, beings who postpone their own enlightenment to aid others, is central to Mahayana thought, unlike in Theravada Buddhism where the primary goal is individual Nirvana.
2. Mahayana Buddhism, unlike Hinayana, emphasizes the deification of the Buddha, image worship, and elaborate rituals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  A core tenet differentiating Mahayana from Theravada Buddhism is the concept of the Bodhisattva.  In Theravada, the ultimate goal is the attainment of Nirvana, the cessation of suffering, primarily through individual effort. Mahayana, however, introduces the Bodhisattva ideal: enlightened beings who, out of compassion, delay their own Nirvana to guide others towards enlightenment. This highlights Mahayana's emphasis on universal salvation and selfless action.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While Hinayana Buddhism traditionally avoided idol worship, Mahayana Buddhism embraces it extensively. The Buddha is often depicted in divine forms, and elaborate rituals and ceremonies become integral parts of Mahayana practice. This reflects a shift towards a more devotional and accessible form of Buddhism, catering to a broader population.  The emphasis on image worship and rituals in Mahayana contrasts sharply with the more austere practices often associated with Theravada.


**3. With reference to the Four Buddhist Councils, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, resulted in the compilation of the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic rules) and the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's teachings).
2. The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of Kanishka, led to a significant division within Buddhism, resulting in the emergence of Mahayana and Hinayana schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The First Buddhist Council, convened at Rajgriha soon after the Buddha's death, played a critical role in preserving his teachings.  Under the leadership of Mahakasyapa, the council focused on standardizing and recording the core tenets of the Buddhist doctrine.  This resulted in the compilation of the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the rules and regulations for monastic life, and the Sutta Pitaka, a collection of the Buddha's discourses and teachings.  This act of preservation was essential for the transmission and continuity of Buddhism.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Fourth Buddhist Council, held under the patronage of the Kushan emperor Kanishka at Kundalvana in Kashmir (around 72 AD), is often associated with a major schism in Buddhism.  While the exact nature and extent of the council's impact are debated, it is widely believed that this period saw the formalization of the distinction between the Hinayana and Mahayana schools of Buddhism, reflecting diverging interpretations of Buddhist philosophy and practice.  This divergence marks a significant turning point in Buddhist history.


**4. With reference to Jainism's core tenets, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jainism, unlike Buddhism, affirms the existence of the Atman (soul), which undergoes a cycle of rebirth (samsara) influenced by Karma.
2.  The principle of Anekantavada, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of reality, is a central philosophical concept of Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key difference between Jainism and Buddhism lies in their views on the soul.  Buddhism rejects the concept of a permanent, unchanging self (Atman), viewing the individual as a composite of constantly changing skandhas (aggregates). Jainism, however, strongly asserts the existence of the Atman – a real, individual soul – which is subject to reincarnation (samsara) based on the accumulation of Karma.  This difference significantly impacts their respective paths to liberation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Anekantavada, often translated as "many-sidedness" or "multifacetedness," is a foundational philosophical principle within Jainism. It emphasizes that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives; no single viewpoint can encompass the complete truth.  This principle encourages tolerance, understanding of diverse viewpoints, and a nuanced approach to knowledge. It's a central element of Jain epistemology and ethics.


**5. With reference to the major schools of Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Digambara sect, known for its strict asceticism, traditionally requires monks to be completely naked (Digambara meaning "sky-clad"), while the Svetambara sect allows monks to wear white clothes.
2.  Both Digambara and Svetambara sects accept the authority of the Jain Agamas, the canonical scriptures containing the teachings of the Tirthankaras.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Digambara and Svetambara sects represent the two major branches of Jainism, distinguished by significant differences in their practices and beliefs.  A striking difference lies in their monastic attire.  Digambara monks traditionally practice complete nudity, symbolizing their renunciation of worldly attachments.  Svetambara monks, on the other hand, wear white clothes, reflecting a slightly less austere approach to asceticism.  This difference in monastic dress serves as a visible marker of the distinct traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both sects acknowledge the importance of the Jain Agamas, the Digambaras do not accept the authority of the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi in the 5th century CE, believing the original texts were lost. The Svetambaras, however, consider these later compiled texts to be authoritative. This divergence in acceptance of canonical texts highlights a fundamental difference in their approaches to scripture and doctrinal authority.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the philosophical schools of ancient India:**

1.  The Samkhya school emphasizes the dualism of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter),  arguing that liberation comes from realizing the distinction between the two.
2.  The Nyaya school focuses on logic and epistemology, establishing methods for valid knowledge acquisition and reasoning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a central tenet of Samkhya philosophy. Samkhya is a dualistic system that posits two fundamental realities: Purusha, the eternal, unchanging consciousness, and Prakriti, the dynamic, evolving material world.  Liberation (moksha) in Samkhya is achieved through the realization of the distinction between these two entities, leading to the cessation of the identification of Purusha with Prakriti and its attributes. This understanding is crucial for comprehending Samkhya's approach to liberation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Nyaya, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, is primarily concerned with epistemology (the study of knowledge) and logic.  It develops a systematic framework for valid knowledge acquisition, emphasizing the importance of perception, inference, comparison, and other sources of knowledge.  The Nyaya school's contributions to logic and methodology have had a lasting impact on Indian philosophical thought.


**7. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charvaka (Lokayata) school is a materialistic philosophy that rejects the existence of a soul, an afterlife, and the authority of the Vedas, emphasizing sensory experience and worldly pleasure.
2.  Jainism, while rejecting Vedic authority, emphasizes the existence of the Atman (soul) and the cycle of rebirth (samsara), advocating for non-violence (ahimsa) as a path to liberation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly characterizes the Charvaka (Lokayata) school.  This school is known for its radical materialism, rejecting metaphysical concepts such as the soul, rebirth, and the supernatural. They emphasized direct sensory experience as the only reliable source of knowledge and advocated for the pursuit of worldly pleasures as the ultimate goal of life. This stands in stark contrast to the other orthodox and heterodox schools.

Statement 2 accurately describes Jainism's philosophical position.  Jainism, classified as a heterodox school because it rejects Vedic authority, uniquely combines a belief in the Atman (soul) with the concept of samsara (the cycle of rebirth).  However, unlike many other schools, Jainism emphasizes the path of non-violence (ahimsa) as the primary means of overcoming karma and achieving liberation (moksha). This unique combination of concepts distinguishes Jain philosophy.


**8. With reference to Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1. Kalidasa, considered one of the greatest poets and dramatists of Sanskrit literature, authored plays like Abhijnanashakuntalam, Vikramorvashiyam, and Malavikagnimitram.
2.  The Sangam literature of Tamil Nadu, dating back to the period between 300 BCE and 300 CE, comprises a vast collection of poems reflecting diverse aspects of ancient Tamil society and culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately identifies Kalidasa's significant contributions to Sanskrit literature. Kalidasa is widely regarded as a master of Sanskrit poetry and drama.  His three major plays, Abhijnanashakuntalam (The Recognition of Shakuntala), Vikramorvashiyam (Urvashi won by Valor), and Malavikagnimitram (Malavika and Agnimitra), are celebrated for their lyrical beauty, compelling narratives, and insightful portrayal of human emotions.  These works are considered classics of Sanskrit drama.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sangam literature represents a rich corpus of ancient Tamil poetry, produced during the Sangam period (roughly 300 BCE – 300 CE).  This literature offers invaluable insights into the social, political, and cultural life of ancient Tamil society.  The poems cover a wide range of themes, including love, war, nature, and ethical conduct, providing a vivid picture of the era. The sheer volume and diversity of the Sangam corpus make it an important source for understanding ancient South India.


**9. With reference to the history of Indian cinema, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadasaheb Phalke is widely regarded as the "Father of Indian Cinema," known for his pioneering work in producing the first full-length Indian feature film, Raja Harishchandra, in 1913.
2. The early decades of Indian cinema were dominated by silent films, often accompanied by live musical performances in theaters to enhance the viewing experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately credits Dadasaheb Phalke with a pivotal role in the development of Indian cinema.  His 1913 film, Raja Harishchandra, is widely recognized as the first full-length Indian feature film, marking a significant milestone in the history of Indian filmmaking.  Phalke's contribution laid the foundation for the growth of the Indian film industry, earning him the title of "Father of Indian Cinema."

Statement 2 correctly describes the characteristics of early Indian cinema.  The initial decades of Indian filmmaking were marked by the prevalence of silent films. While lacking spoken dialogue, these films were far from silent in their presentation.  Theatrical screenings were often accompanied by live musical performances, involving instruments like the sarangi, tabla, harmonium, and violin, to create a more immersive and engaging cinematic experience for the audience.  This practice underscores the creative adaptations employed in early Indian cinema.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Anekantavada emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, rejecting the notion of a single absolute truth.
2.  The Digambara sect accepts the authority of the Agamas compiled in Vallabhi, while the Svetambara sect rejects them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, posits that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives.  It rejects the idea of a singular, absolute truth, emphasizing the limitations of human understanding in grasping the totality of existence. This principle promotes tolerance and acceptance of diverse viewpoints.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The situation is reversed. The Svetambara sect accepts the Agamas compiled at Vallabhi as authoritative scriptures, representing a canon of Jain teachings. The Digambara sect, however, does not accept the Vallabhi canon, believing the original teachings were lost and rejecting the authority of these later compilations.  This difference in scriptural authority reflects a fundamental divergence between the two major Jain sects.  The historical context of these compilations and the subsequent schisms within Jainism are crucial points to understand the complexities of Jain theological history.


**2. With reference to Buddhist schools of thought, consider the following statements:**

1.  Theravada Buddhism emphasizes individual enlightenment through the Noble Eightfold Path and rejects the concept of Bodhisattvas.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism promotes the Bodhisattva ideal, where individuals postpone their own enlightenment to aid others in achieving liberation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Theravada Buddhism, often considered the older tradition, focuses on the individual's path to Nirvana through the Noble Eightfold Path, emphasizing self-discipline and meditation. While the concept of Bodhisattvas exists in some Theravada traditions, it's not a central tenet like in Mahayana.  The emphasis remains on personal liberation.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahayana Buddhism introduces the Bodhisattva ideal, a pivotal concept emphasizing compassion and the postponement of one's own enlightenment to assist others on their path to liberation. This altruistic approach contrasts with the more individualistic focus of Theravada.  Understanding the differences between the Bodhisattva path and the Arhat path is key to grasping the contrasting philosophies within Buddhism.


**3. With reference to the evolution of Indian philosophical schools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, founded by Kapila, is characterized by its dualistic ontology, positing the separation of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2.  The Vaisheshika school, attributed to Kanada, emphasizes a materialistic worldview with a focus on atomism and the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, is fundamentally dualistic, separating Purusha (the pure consciousness, unchanging and eternal) from Prakriti (the dynamic material principle, subject to change and evolution). This dualism is a central theme in Samkhya's explanation of the cosmos and the path to liberation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaisheshika school, also an orthodox school, is known for its materialistic approach, emphasizing the reality of the physical world.  Its atomic theory, proposing that all matter is composed of indivisible atoms, is a significant contribution to early Indian science.  The five elements are foundational to its understanding of the material universe, and it seeks to explain phenomena through the interaction of these elements and their constituent atoms.


**4. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Charvaka (Lokayata) school is known for its materialistic and hedonistic philosophy, emphasizing sensory experience and rejecting the concepts of afterlife and supernatural phenomena.
2.  Jainism, unlike Buddhism, believes in the existence of a permanent soul (Atman) and advocates for strict non-violence (Ahimsa) as a core principle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Charvaka school, a materialistic and hedonistic philosophy, stands in stark contrast to the orthodox schools. It emphasizes sensory experience as the sole source of knowledge, rejecting metaphysical concepts like the soul, rebirth, and the existence of a divine being.  Its focus is on maximizing pleasure in this life.

Statement 2 is correct.  Jainism differs from Buddhism in its belief in the existence of a permanent soul (Atman), although it views the soul differently than many orthodox schools. Ahimsa (non-violence) is a fundamental principle in Jainism, influencing its ethical framework and lifestyle choices, leading to extreme vegetarianism and pacifism.


**5. With reference to ancient Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization is characterized by its sophisticated urban planning, including grid layouts and advanced drainage systems, but lacked monumental architecture like grand temples or palaces.
2.  The rock-cut architecture of Ajanta and Ellora caves showcases a blend of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain religious themes, reflecting the syncretic nature of religious beliefs during that period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Harappan civilization, while exhibiting remarkable urban planning with its grid system and sophisticated drainage, lacked the monumental architecture seen in later periods of Indian history.  While evidence of religious practices exists, large-scale temples or palaces have not been definitively identified. This reflects a different societal organization and priorities compared to later civilizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The rock-cut caves of Ajanta and Ellora represent a pinnacle of ancient Indian art and architecture.  They feature a remarkable variety of styles and religious themes, with Buddhist chaityas and viharas coexisting alongside Hindu and Jain shrines. This coexistence highlights the religious pluralism and syncretism that characterized certain periods in Indian history. The artistic skill and the scale of these cave temples are also noteworthy.


**6. With reference to Indian painting traditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal school of painting, influenced by Persian styles, is known for its detailed realism, rich colours, and depictions of courtly life, portraits, and natural scenes.
2.  The Rajput school of painting, patronized by Rajput rulers, developed distinct regional styles, often characterized by vibrant colours, romanticized depictions of love, and mythological themes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Mughal school of painting, flourishing under Mughal patronage, synthesized Persian and Indian artistic traditions. Its hallmarks include meticulous detail, the use of vibrant colours, and the depiction of court scenes, portraits of rulers, and realistic portrayals of flora and fauna.  The development of miniature painting reached a high point under the Mughals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajput school of painting, patronized by various Rajput kingdoms, developed diverse regional styles.  These styles are characterized by their use of bright colours, romanticized depictions of love stories from Hindu epics and literature, and the portrayal of mythological and devotional themes. The distinct regional variations within the Rajput school reflect the cultural diversity of the Rajput kingdoms.


**7. With reference to the Jain religious practices, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting to death, is considered a form of suicide by Jain scholars and is legally prohibited in India.
2.  Pratikraman is a daily ritual of repentance and self-reflection, where Jains confess their past mistakes and resolve to avoid repeating them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sallekhana, the practice of voluntary fasting unto death, is a controversial topic, Jain scholars do *not* uniformly consider it suicide.  They argue that it is a conscious and deliberate act undertaken with specific religious motivations, aiming for spiritual liberation rather than self-harm.  However, the legality of Sallekhana has been debated in Indian courts, with varying rulings.

Statement 2 is correct. Pratikraman is a fundamental aspect of Jain daily life.  It is a ritualistic confession and repentance, where individuals reflect on their actions and seek forgiveness for their misdeeds. This practice is crucial to the Jain emphasis on self-purification and ethical conduct.  The different types of Pratikraman, performed at various intervals, are also important to understand.


**8. With reference to the  teachings of Mahavira, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahavira’s teachings emphasized the concept of Triratna (three jewels): Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, as the path to liberation.
2.  Mahavira advocated for the observance of five great vows (mahavratas): Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-attachment).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of Triratna (three jewels) — Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct — is a fundamental tenet of Jainism, but it's not solely attributed to Mahavira's teachings.  These principles are considered essential for spiritual progress and liberation within the Jain tradition,  but  their formulation predates Mahavira.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mahavira indeed emphasized the five great vows (mahavratas) as the highest principles of Jain ethics. These vows represent an ideal for Jain ascetics and provide a framework for ethical conduct in everyday life.  The strict adherence to these vows is a hallmark of Jain practice.  However, the concept of these vows evolved over time and is not solely attributed to Mahavira's initial teachings.


**9. With reference to the two major sects within Jainism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Digambara sect is characterized by its practice of nudity for male monks, while the Svetambara sect allows monks to wear white clothes.
2.  The Digambara sect believes that women cannot attain the status of a Tirthankara, while the Svetambara sect holds that women can attain this status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key distinction between the Digambara and Svetambara sects lies in the monastic dress code. Digambara monks traditionally practice nudity, symbolizing complete renunciation of worldly attachments. Svetambara monks, on the other hand, wear white clothes. This difference in practice reflects deeper theological and philosophical divergences.

Statement 2 is correct.  Another significant divergence between the two sects concerns the possibility of women attaining the highest spiritual status of a Tirthankara.  The Digambara sect traditionally maintains that only men can become Tirthankaras, while the Svetambara sect does not hold this restriction.  This difference in belief reflects differing interpretations of Jain scriptures and traditions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect core tenets of Jain philosophy.  Anekantavada, a central doctrine, posits that reality is complex and possesses multiple perspectives, thus rejecting simplistic, singular truths.  This concept directly challenges the idea of absolute, singular truth found in some other philosophical systems.  The three jewels (Ratnatraya) – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) – represent the threefold path Jains follow to overcome karma and achieve liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death.  These three jewels are fundamental to the Jain path and are emphasized throughout Jain scriptures and teachings.  Therefore, both statements are correct representations of Jain philosophy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the precise timeline and details of the Fourth Buddhist Council are debated, it is widely accepted that this council, held during the reign of King Kanishka, played a significant role in solidifying the distinction between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism.  The council formalized existing differences in doctrine and practice, leading to the recognition of two distinct branches within Buddhism.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Pali Canon, considered the most complete surviving collection of early Buddhist texts, is central to Theravada Buddhism.  It is organized into three sections: Vinaya (monastic discipline), Sutta (discourses of the Buddha), and Abhidhamma (higher doctrine). The accurate description of the Pali Canon and its structure validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements are historically accurate.



**3. With reference to the philosophies of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samkhya school, founded by Kapila Muni, emphasizes the duality of Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter) as the fundamental constituents of reality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of these ancient Indian philosophical schools. The Samkhya school, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, is fundamentally dualistic. It posits that reality is composed of two independent and distinct entities: Purusha (the conscious self or spirit) and Prakriti (primordial matter or nature).  The interaction of these two principles is the basis for the phenomenal world.  The Vaisheshika school, another of the six orthodox schools, is known for its detailed analysis of the physical world.  A significant contribution of this school is its development of an atomic theory, proposing that all physical objects are made up of indivisible atoms (paramāṇu) that combine to form molecules and larger entities.  This atomic theory predates similar developments in Western thought.  Thus, both statements accurately reflect the core tenets of these schools.


**4. With reference to the Vedic period in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately characterize key features of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda. The Rigveda, the earliest of the four Vedas, is primarily a collection of hymns (suktas) addressed to various deities.  These hymns reflect the Vedic people's worldview, their rituals, their societal structures, and their relationship with the natural world.  Indra (god of thunder and war), Agni (god of fire), and Soma (a ritualistic drink) are prominent figures in the Rigvedic hymns. The Atharvaveda, while also containing some hymns, is distinguished by its focus on spells, charms, and incantations related to practical concerns of daily life, such as healing, protection from harm, and ensuring prosperity.  It reflects a more applied and pragmatic use of Vedic knowledge compared to the primarily devotional focus of the Rigveda.  Therefore, both statements are accurate descriptions of their respective Vedas.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti saints primarily composed their verses in Sanskrit, aiming to reach a wide audience across different regions.
2.  The Bhakti movement emphasized devotion and personal experience of the divine, challenging the rigid hierarchical structure of traditional Brahmanical Hinduism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some Bhakti saints did use Sanskrit, many more composed their verses in vernacular languages, such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Marathi. This was a deliberate strategy to reach a wider audience beyond the learned elite who primarily understood Sanskrit. The use of regional languages was a key factor in the widespread popularity of the Bhakti movement. Statement 2 is correct.  A defining characteristic of the Bhakti movement was its emphasis on direct, personal devotion to a chosen deity.  This contrasted sharply with the more ritualistic and hierarchical aspects of traditional Brahmanical Hinduism, making it accessible to people of all castes and social backgrounds.  The Bhakti saints often challenged the authority of the priestly class and emphasized the importance of individual faith and experience.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa exhibited sophisticated urban planning, including grid layouts, drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes.
2.  Evidence suggests the Indus Valley Civilization lacked any significant religious or ritualistic practices, as indicated by the absence of temples or elaborate burial sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological evidence from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveals a high degree of urban planning sophistication unparalleled for its time.  The cities were laid out in a grid pattern, with well-planned streets and drainage systems.  The use of standardized bricks indicates advanced construction techniques.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the nature of religious practices in the Indus Valley Civilization is still debated, evidence suggests the presence of ritualistic activities.  The discovery of objects interpreted as possible cult figures, seals with symbolic imagery, and carefully constructed structures suggests religious or ritualistic practices were indeed part of their culture.  The lack of clear evidence of large-scale temples doesn't negate the possibility of smaller-scale or less conventional religious expressions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, predominantly found in North India, is characterized by curvilinear shikharas (towers) and typically features a rekha (linear) or latina (curvilinear) style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the key characteristics of the Nagara and Dravida styles of Indian temple architecture.  The Nagara style, prevalent in northern and central India, is known for its curvilinear shikharas (towers) that rise gracefully upwards. These towers can be further classified into rekha (linear) or latina (curvilinear) styles based on their shape and proportions.  The Dravida style, dominant in South India, is characterized by its pyramidal vimana (towers) with a series of receding tiers.  A distinct feature of many Dravidian temples is the presence of a gopuram (gate tower), an imposing structure that marks the entrance to the temple complex.  These stylistic differences reflect the diverse regional variations within Indian temple architecture. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**8. With reference to the schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mimamsa school focuses primarily on the interpretation and application of the Brahmanas and Samhitas, emphasizing the importance of Vedic rituals for attaining religious merit.
2. The Vedanta school, based on the Upanishads, explores the nature of Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (individual self), with various sub-schools, such as Advaita Vedanta, offering different perspectives on their relationship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core concerns of the Mimamsa and Vedanta schools of Indian philosophy. The Mimamsa school, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, is primarily concerned with the interpretation and proper performance of Vedic rituals.  It emphasizes the importance of understanding the meaning and purpose of these rituals to achieve religious merit and liberation. The Brahmanas and Samhitas, which contain detailed descriptions of Vedic sacrifices and ceremonies, form the primary textual basis for Mimamsa. The Vedanta school, also an orthodox school, is focused on the understanding of the Upanishads, which delve into the nature of Brahman (the ultimate reality) and Atman (the individual self).  Vedanta explores the relationship between these two concepts, with different sub-schools, such as Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism) and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (qualified non-dualism), offering varying interpretations.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**9. With reference to the concept of Bodhisattva in Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bodhisattva concept in Buddhism. The Bodhisattva path is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism.  A Bodhisattva is a being who has attained enlightenment but chooses to postpone their own entry into Nirvana to dedicate their lives to helping others achieve liberation.  This selfless act of compassion and dedication is a fundamental aspect of the Mahayana ideal. Statement 2 is also correct. Avalokiteshvara (associated with compassion), Vajrapani (associated with power), and Manjusri (associated with wisdom) are indeed prominent Bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism. They are frequently depicted in Buddhist art and are considered important figures embodying specific qualities on the path to Buddhahood.  Their roles as protective deities further underscore their significance in Buddhist iconography and practice.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the Bodhisattva concept.


**10. With reference to the religious practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sthanakvasi sect, a sub-sect within Jainism, emphasizes the importance of individual worship and rejects the use of temple idols.
2. The Sallekhana practice, a form of voluntary fasting unto death, is considered a religiously acceptable practice within Jainism, although its legality has been debated in modern times.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe specific religious practices within Jainism.  The Sthanakvasi sect is a distinct sub-sect within the Svetambara tradition of Jainism.  They are known for their emphasis on individual worship and their rejection of the use of temple idols for worship.  Their focus is on personal spiritual practice and self-discipline, rather than reliance on temple-based rituals.  Statement 2 is also correct. Sallekhana, sometimes referred to as Santhara, is a practice within Jainism where an individual voluntarily undertakes a fast unto death, typically under medical supervision, as a means of ending life with dignity and peace during the final stages of an incurable disease. While it is considered a religiously acceptable practice within certain interpretations of Jain philosophy, its legality has been a subject of debate and legal challenges in recent times, reflecting the tension between religious freedom and the legal framework governing end-of-life decisions. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Jain religious practices.


**1. With reference to Jain philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anekantavada, a core principle of Jainism, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of truth, asserting that no single perspective can fully encompass reality.
2.  The concept of Ratnatraya (three jewels) in Jainism comprises Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, forming the path to liberation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect core tenets of Jain philosophy.  Anekantavada, often translated as "many-sidedness" or "multifacetedness," is a fundamental principle that rejects absolute truth in favor of acknowledging the complexity and multiplicity of perspectives on reality. This contrasts with philosophies that posit a single, definitive truth.  The concept emphasizes the limitations of human perception and understanding, encouraging a nuanced and comprehensive approach to knowledge.

The Ratnatraya (three jewels) – Right Faith (Samyak Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyak Gyan), and Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) – are indeed the foundational pillars of Jain practice and belief.  These three elements represent the essential aspects of the Jain path to liberation (moksha), emphasizing the interconnectedness of belief, understanding, and ethical action in achieving spiritual freedom.  The attainment of these three jewels is considered essential for overcoming karma and achieving liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Therefore, both statements are accurate representations of Jain philosophical thought.


**2. With reference to Buddhist schools of thought, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hinayana Buddhism, emphasizing individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation, rejects the deification of the Buddha and the concept of Bodhisattvas.
2.  Mahayana Buddhism, characterized by a focus on universal salvation and the Bodhisattva path, incorporates the deification of the Buddha and emphasizes image worship and rituals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key distinction between Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism.  Hinayana (meaning "Lesser Vehicle"), often associated with Theravada Buddhism, primarily focuses on individual enlightenment through personal practice and self-cultivation.  It traditionally does not emphasize the deification of the Buddha or the concept of Bodhisattvas, figures who postpone their own enlightenment to help others. The emphasis is on achieving Nirvana through rigorous self-discipline and meditation.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects the characteristics of Mahayana Buddhism ("Greater Vehicle"). Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the Bodhisattva path, where individuals strive for enlightenment not only for themselves but for all beings.  This path involves compassion, selfless service, and the postponement of Nirvana to aid others in their spiritual journey.  The deification of the Buddha and the incorporation of image worship and rituals are common features of Mahayana traditions, reflecting a broader, more inclusive approach to spiritual practice.  Therefore, both statements accurately capture fundamental differences between these two major schools of Buddhist thought.


**3. With reference to the concept of the soul in different Indian philosophies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jainism, unlike Buddhism, affirms the existence of the soul (Atman) as a fundamental and enduring entity.
2.  Charvaka philosophy, a materialistic school of thought, denies the existence of both the soul (Atman) and the concept of an afterlife.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights a key difference between Jainism and Buddhism. Jainism explicitly affirms the existence of the soul (Atman) as a real, individual entity that experiences the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.  This soul is considered the core of an individual's being, capable of experiencing both pleasure and pain, and ultimately seeking liberation (moksha).  Buddhism, in contrast, rejects the concept of a permanent, unchanging soul, emphasizing instead the impermanence (Anicca) of all phenomena, including the self.

Statement 2 is also correct in its description of Charvaka philosophy (also known as Lokayata).  This materialistic school of thought, dating back to ancient India, is known for its radical skepticism and rejection of metaphysical concepts.  They deny the existence of a soul (Atman), reincarnation, and any form of afterlife, focusing instead on the tangible and observable aspects of the world.  Their philosophy emphasizes the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain in this life, rejecting any spiritual or religious beliefs centered around the soul or an afterlife.  Therefore, both statements correctly represent the distinct perspectives on the soul found in these different Indian philosophical traditions.


**4. With reference to the religious practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sallekhana, a practice of voluntary fasting unto death, is considered a form of suicide by both Jain and Buddhist scholars.
2.  Pratikraman, a Jain practice of daily repentance and self-reflection, involves acknowledging past mistakes and resolving to avoid repeating them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sallekhana, a practice of voluntary fasting to death, is a controversial topic, it is *not* uniformly considered suicide by Jain scholars.  Jain texts and scholars typically argue that Sallekhana is not suicide because it is performed with a detached mindset, without aversion or attachment, and is seen as a means to end the cycle of suffering and achieve liberation. The act is undertaken with complete acceptance of death, not out of anger, despair, or hatred.  Buddhist views on Sallekhana are generally more critical, viewing it as a form of self-harm that contradicts Buddhist principles of compassion and non-harming.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Jain practice of Pratikraman.  It is a daily ritual where Jains engage in introspection and repentance for their actions during the day. This involves acknowledging transgressions against the five vows (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, and Aparigraha) and seeking forgiveness for these actions. Pratikraman is a vital aspect of Jain spiritual practice, aiming to purify the mind and soul through self-awareness and amends for past wrongdoings.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to the heterodox schools of Indian philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ajivika philosophy, founded by Makkhali Gosala, is characterized by its belief in absolute determinism (Niyati), where all events are pre-ordained.
2.  The Ajnana school, emphasizing radical skepticism, maintained that attaining knowledge about the nature of reality is impossible and even if possible, is ultimately useless.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a central tenet of Ajivika philosophy.  This ancient Indian school of thought, founded by Makkhali Gosala, is known for its strong belief in absolute determinism (Niyati).  They believed that all events, from birth to death, are pre-ordained and governed by immutable cosmic laws.  This deterministic worldview leaves no room for free will or human agency in shaping one's destiny.  This contrasts sharply with philosophies that emphasize karma and the potential for individual action to influence one's future.

Statement 2 accurately captures the essence of the Ajnana school's perspective. This school of thought embraced radical skepticism, arguing that true knowledge about the nature of reality is unattainable.  They believed that even if such knowledge were possible, it would be of no use in achieving liberation or spiritual progress. Their extreme skepticism was a departure from the mainstream schools of Indian philosophy, which generally sought to understand and explain the workings of the universe and the path to liberation.  Therefore, both statements are accurate characterizations of these heterodox schools of Indian philosophy.


**6. With reference to the different schools of Orthodox Indian Philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Samkhya philosophy, founded by Kapila, posits a dualistic worldview, distinguishing between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter).
2.  Vaisheshika philosophy, associated with Kanada, emphasizes the physical reality of the universe, proposing a theory of atomism and explaining the world through five basic elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a fundamental aspect of Samkhya philosophy.  This ancient Indian school of thought, attributed to Kapila, is characterized by its dualistic worldview, which distinguishes between Purusha (the pure consciousness, the self) and Prakriti (primordial nature, the material world).  Samkhya philosophy emphasizes the separation of these two fundamental principles, arguing that the liberation of Purusha from the entanglement of Prakriti is the ultimate goal of human existence.  This dualistic perspective is a cornerstone of Samkhya's metaphysical framework.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects the core tenets of Vaisheshika philosophy.  Associated with Kanada, this school is known for its focus on the physical world and its development of a theory of atomism.  Vaisheshika philosophy explains the universe through the interaction of five basic elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) and proposes that all physical objects are composed of atoms (paramāṇu).  Their emphasis on empirical observation and logical analysis contributed significantly to the development of scientific thinking in ancient India. Therefore, both statements provide accurate summaries of these two important orthodox schools of Indian philosophy.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the evolution of Indian Cinema:**

1. Dadasaheb Phalke's *Raja Harishchandra*, released in 1913, is widely considered the first Indian feature film, marking the beginning of Indian cinema.
2. The decade of 1910 to 1920 in Indian cinema was dominated by silent films, often accompanied by live musical performances during screenings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is generally accepted as true. While there were earlier short films made in India, Dadasaheb Phalke's *Raja Harishchandra* is widely recognized as the first full-length Indian feature film.  Its release in 1913 is a significant milestone in the history of Indian cinema, marking the beginning of a distinct Indian film industry. Phalke is often referred to as the "Father of Indian Cinema" for this pioneering achievement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The period from 1910 to 1920 witnessed the dominance of silent films in India.  Although technically "silent," these films were not entirely without sound. They were often accompanied by live musical performances in theaters to enhance the viewing experience. Musicians played instruments like the sarangi, tabla, harmonium, and violin, adding emotional depth and context to the visual narrative. This practice was common until the advent of sound films in the late 1920s and 1930s.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the early development of Indian cinema.


**8. With reference to the Bhakti Movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the translation of Sanskrit religious texts into vernacular languages to make them accessible to the masses.
2.  The movement was characterized by a strong emphasis on personal devotion (Bhakti) to a chosen deity, transcending traditional caste barriers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A significant aspect of the Bhakti movement was the translation and dissemination of religious texts from Sanskrit, the language of the elite, into various vernacular languages.  This made religious teachings accessible to a wider audience, including those from lower castes and different regions.  The use of local languages facilitated broader participation and understanding of religious concepts, fostering a more inclusive spiritual environment.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Bhakti movement was fundamentally characterized by a deep emphasis on personal devotion (Bhakti) to a chosen deity.  This devotional approach challenged the rigid social hierarchies of the time, as it emphasized the direct relationship between the individual devotee and God, irrespective of caste or social status.  The Bhakti saints often preached against caste discrimination and promoted a more egalitarian spiritual path, emphasizing the universality of divine love. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect important aspects of the Bhakti movement's impact on Indian religious and social life.


**9. With reference to the major sects within Hinduism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Shaiva tradition, encompassing diverse sub-sects, is unified by its reverence for Lord Shiva as the supreme deity.
2.  The Vaishnava tradition, encompassing various sub-sects, centers on the worship of Lord Vishnu as the supreme deity, with distinct schools like Brahma Sampradaya and Pushti Marg.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Shaiva tradition within Hinduism.  While encompassing a variety of sub-sects and practices, the Shaiva tradition is fundamentally united by its devotion to Lord Shiva as the supreme deity.  Different Shaiva schools may emphasize different aspects of Shiva's nature or adopt varied ritual practices, but the central focus on Shiva as the ultimate reality remains a unifying element.


Statement 2 is also correct in its characterization of the Vaishnava tradition.  Similarly diverse in its practices and philosophical interpretations, the Vaishnava tradition shares a common focus on the worship of Lord Vishnu as the supreme deity.  The statement correctly points out the existence of distinct schools of Vaishnavism, such as Brahma Sampradaya and Pushti Marg, each with its own unique theological emphasis and ritual traditions.  The diversity within Vaishnavism reflects the rich tapestry of beliefs and practices that have evolved within this major Hindu tradition.  Therefore, both statements correctly identify and describe key characteristics of these major Hindu sects.


**10. With reference to the four Vedas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rig Veda, the oldest of the four Vedas, primarily focuses on hymns dedicated to various deities, with a significant emphasis on Lord Indra.
2. The Sama Veda, known as the "book of chants," primarily consists of melodies and songs, many of which are derived from the Rig Veda.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the Rig Veda.  The Rig Veda, the oldest of the four Vedas, is indeed a collection of hymns (suktas) addressed to various deities.  Lord Indra, the king of gods, features prominently in many of these hymns, reflecting his importance in the Vedic pantheon.  The hymns cover a wide range of themes, including praise of deities, descriptions of nature, and accounts of mythical events. The Rig Veda offers valuable insights into the beliefs, rituals, and social structures of early Vedic society.

Statement 2 also accurately describes the Sama Veda.  The Sama Veda is characterized by its focus on melodies and chants (samans).  A significant portion of its content is derived from the Rig Veda, with hymns adapted and modified for musical performance.  The Sama Veda is considered the Veda of melodies and chants, playing a crucial role in Vedic rituals and ceremonies.  Its musical nature highlights the importance of sound and rhythm in Vedic religious practice. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the content and characteristics of two of the four Vedas.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is renowned for its association with the enlightenment of the Buddha and is located in Uttar Pradesh.
2.  Nalanda, Vikramshila, and Odantapuri were prominent Mahaviharas primarily associated with Hinayana Buddhism and situated in present-day Bihar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple, a significant site for Buddhists, marking the location where Buddha attained enlightenment, is situated in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly places it in Uttar Pradesh.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Nalanda, Vikramshila, and Odantapuri were indeed prominent Mahaviharas (monastic universities), but they were primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism, not Hinayana Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism, with its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal and the potential for universal enlightenment, flourished in these centers.  Their location in present-day Bihar is accurate.  The question uses the term "primarily associated" to allow for the possibility of some Hinayana influence, but the dominant school of thought was Mahayana.


**2. With reference to major Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lalitagiri, Vajragiri, and Ratnagiri, located in Odisha, are known for their well-preserved stupas and monasteries showcasing the early phases of Buddhist art.
2.  Sanchi and Bharhut, situated in Madhya Pradesh, are significant for their stupas and sculptures, representing the development of Buddhist art during the Mauryan period and beyond.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(b) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lalitagiri, Vajragiri, and Ratnagiri in Odisha are indeed important Buddhist sites with well-preserved remains of stupas and monasteries. These sites reflect the significant presence of Buddhism in the region and the artistic styles prevalent during that period.  The statement accurately describes their significance and location.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sanchi and Bharhut in Madhya Pradesh are two of the most important early Buddhist sites in India.  Their stupas and sculptures are crucial for understanding the evolution of Buddhist art, starting from the Mauryan period and continuing into later eras. The statement accurately reflects their historical importance and artistic significance.  The statement's reference to the Mauryan period and beyond is accurate as the development of Buddhist art at these sites continued beyond the Mauryan era.


**3. With reference to Jain pilgrimage sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Palitana temples, located in the Shatrunjay hills of Gujarat, are exclusively dedicated to Rishabha, the first Tirthankara, and are revered by the Digambara sect.
2.  The Dilwara temples in Mount Abu, Rajasthan, are renowned for their intricate marble carvings and represent a blend of Solanki and Nagara architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Palitana temples in the Shatrunjay hills of Gujarat are indeed a significant pilgrimage site for Jains, and are primarily dedicated to Rishabha, the first Tirthankara, they are revered by *both* the Svetambara and Digambara sects, not exclusively the Digambara sect.  The statement incorrectly limits the reverence to only one sect.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Dilwara temples in Mount Abu, Rajasthan, are famous for their exquisite marble carvings.  However, their architectural style is more accurately described as being primarily a unique Jain style with influences from regional styles rather than a direct blend of Solanki and Nagara. While regional styles might have influenced the overall design, characterizing it as a direct blend is an oversimplification.


**4. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The use of arches and domes, characteristic of Indo-Islamic architecture, completely replaced the traditional trabeate style of construction prevalent in pre-Islamic Indian architecture.
2.  Pietra dura, the inlay technique of precious coloured stones and gems, was a unique decorative feature introduced during the Mughal period and extensively used in buildings such as the Taj Mahal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While arches and domes became prominent features of Indo-Islamic architecture, and the arcuate style became dominant, it didn't entirely *replace* the trabeate style.  Elements of the trabeate style (using lintels and post-and-lintel construction) continued to be used, often integrated with the arcuate elements, showing a blending of architectural traditions rather than a complete replacement.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of architectural evolution.

Statement 2 is correct. Pietra dura, the intricate inlay technique using precious and semi-precious stones, was indeed a significant decorative element introduced during the Mughal period, and is prominently featured in many Mughal buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal. The statement accurately identifies both the technique and its prominent use.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the cultural history of India:**

1. The Panchayatan style of temple construction, characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, is exclusively associated with North Indian temple architecture.
2. The term 'Derasar' is used to refer to Jain temples primarily in Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan, while in Karnataka, they are known as 'Basadis'.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Panchayatan style is more common in North Indian temple architecture, it is not exclusively associated with that region. Variations of this style can be found in other parts of India as well, demonstrating the spread and adaptation of architectural ideas across different regions.  The statement is too restrictive in its geographical limitation.

Statement 2 is correct. The term 'Derasar' is indeed predominantly used to denote Jain temples in Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan, while 'Basadis' is the prevalent term for Jain temples in Karnataka.  This reflects the regional variations in terminology within the same religious tradition.  The statement accurately describes the regional usage of these terms.


**6. With reference to Buddhist history, tradition, and culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex, located in the Spiti Valley, is a significant example of Tibetan Buddhist architecture and art.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex in Ladakh is known for its unique blend of Kashmiri, Tibetan, and Western artistic influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tabo Monastery in Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh, is a renowned example of Tibetan Buddhist architecture and art. It is known for its intricate murals, sculptures, and architectural features representing a significant chapter in the history of Buddhism in the Himalayan region. The statement accurately reflects its significance and location.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Alchi Temple Complex in Ladakh exhibits a remarkable fusion of artistic styles. Its architecture and artwork draw from Kashmiri, Tibetan, and even Western artistic traditions, creating a unique and fascinating blend of influences. This blending of styles reflects the complex cultural interactions in the Ladakh region.


**7. With reference to Jain literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalpa Sutra, attributed to Bhadrabahu, primarily focuses on the lives and teachings of the 24 Tirthankaras and is considered a sacred text in both Digambara and Svetambara traditions.
2.  The Tattvartha Sutra, authored by Umaswati, is a significant philosophical work in Sanskrit that explores Jain metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, and is accepted by both Digambara and Svetambara sects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kalpa Sutra, a crucial text in Jainism, details the lives and teachings of the 24 Tirthankaras.  While it's attributed to Bhadrabahu, its authorship is debated, and it holds significance in both the Digambara and Svetambara traditions. The statement correctly identifies its subject matter and its importance to both sects.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Tattvartha Sutra by Umaswati is a fundamental philosophical text in Jainism, written in Sanskrit. It provides a systematic exposition of Jain metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, and is widely accepted by both the Digambara and Svetambara traditions as an authoritative philosophical work.  The statement accurately describes its contents and its acceptance among the sects.


**8. With reference to the  architecture of the Delhi Sultanate period (1206-1526 AD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Qutub Minar, initiated by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, showcases a blend of Indo-Islamic and pre-existing architectural styles, incorporating elements from earlier Hindu and Jain structures.
2. The Arhai Din Ka Jhopra in Ajmer, built during the reign of Sultan Iltutmish, exemplifies the Mameluke style of architecture, characterized by the use of red sandstone and intricate carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Qutub Minar, a significant monument of the Delhi Sultanate, demonstrates a fusion of architectural styles.  It incorporates elements from pre-existing Hindu and Jain structures, reflecting the pragmatic approach of early Indo-Islamic architecture, which often repurposed existing materials and designs. The statement accurately highlights this blend of styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Arhai Din Ka Jhopra in Ajmer is a notable structure from the Delhi Sultanate period, it is associated with the reign of  Sultan Iltutmish's predecessor,  and it is not a prime example of the Mameluke style.  The Mameluke style is more accurately represented by other structures.  Furthermore, while sandstone was used, the description of "intricate carvings" is a bit of an overstatement for this particular structure compared to others of the period.  The statement presents an inaccurate attribution and characterization of the architectural style.


**9. Consider the following statements about South Indian temple architecture:**

1. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, built during the reign of Narasimhavarman II, exemplifies the Dravidian style of architecture with its characteristic gopuram and vimana.
2.  The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, constructed by Raja Raja I, showcases the culmination of Chola architecture, characterized by its massive granite structure and a single, towering vimana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram is a significant Pallava-era monument, it predates the fully developed Dravidian style.  It's more accurately considered a transition between rock-cut and structural temple styles and doesn't fully represent the hallmarks of the later Dravidian style, such as the prominent gopuram. The statement incorrectly attributes a fully developed Dravidian style to this temple.  Narasimhavarman II's reign is also incorrect; it was built under a different Narasimhavarman.

Statement 2 is correct. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur is a prime example of mature Chola architecture.  Its colossal granite structure and the single, imposing vimana are hallmarks of this architectural style, representing its peak achievement.  The statement accurately describes both the temple's characteristics and the architectural style it represents, along with the correct ruler.


**10. With reference to the Hoysala style of temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu is famous for its intricate sculptures and stellate plan, characterized by a star-shaped arrangement of shrines around a central mandapa.
2. The Chennakesava Temple at Belur is known for its extensive use of soapstone (Chlorite schist) and its profusely decorated exterior walls, featuring a multitude of sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu is indeed renowned for its incredibly detailed sculptures and its unique stellate plan, which creates a visually striking and complex arrangement of shrines. The statement accurately describes its key features.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chennakesava Temple at Belur is well-known for the extensive use of soapstone, a material that allowed for the creation of highly detailed sculptures and decorative elements.  The profuse decoration of its exterior walls, with numerous sculptures, is a defining characteristic of the Hoysala style. The statement accurately reflects the temple's construction material and its decorative features.


**1. With reference to the architectural features of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara temples extensively utilized monolithic rock pillars and incorporated multiple mandapas, including a central kalyana mandapa.
2. The Vijayanagara style predominantly featured enclosed temple complexes with gopurams on all sides, showcasing a blend of Chola, Hoysala, Pandya, and Chalukya influences.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Vijayanagara architecture is renowned for its use of monolithic pillars, a testament to the advanced engineering skills of the period.  The construction of multiple mandapas within temple complexes was a common feature, with the kalyana mandapa (wedding pavilion) holding a central position.  These architectural elements added to the grandeur and complexity of their religious structures.

Statement 2 is also correct. Vijayanagara temples were typically part of larger, enclosed complexes, a departure from earlier styles.  The incorporation of gopurams (tower gateways) on all sides, rather than just the entrance, is a significant characteristic.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri was indeed a place of worship for Akbar, its primary function was not simply as his private prayer chamber.  It served as a crucial venue for Akbar's renowned religious debates and discussions with scholars representing diverse faiths, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. This reflects Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in exploring different theological perspectives. Thus statement 2 is correct, while statement 1 is an oversimplification of the Ibadat Khana's role. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical significance and function of this important building. The Ibadat Khana was more than a personal prayer space; it was a center for interfaith dialogue.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Indus Valley Civilization was highly advanced for its time, displaying sophisticated urban planning and engineering, there is limited archaeological evidence to suggest the existence of grand palaces and temples on the scale seen in later periods.  However, evidence from unearthed artifacts, including seals and figurines, strongly indicates the worship of both male and female deities, reflecting a complex religious system.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect, while statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they incorrectly assess the presence of architectural structures or religious practices within the Indus Valley Civilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Chaityas were prayer halls or places of worship, typically featuring a stupa at one end. Viharas, on the other hand, were monastic residences or dwelling places for monks.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary functions of Chaityas and Viharas. Statement 2, while partially correct in mentioning the stupa within a Chaitya, is an oversimplification and not a universally applicable description of all Chaitya structures.  The relationship between the stupa and the main hall could vary in different cave complexes. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the functional distinction between Chaityas and Viharas or incorrectly describe the architectural features of Chaityas.

The Nagara style, characterized by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), is predominantly found in North India. The Dravida style, featuring a pyramidal structure, is mainly seen in South India. The Vesara style, as the name suggests, is a hybrid style that blends elements from both Nagara and Dravida styles, often found in the transition zones between North and South India.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the characteristics and geographical distributions of these architectural styles.  All other options are incorrect, misrepresenting the key features or distribution of these important architectural styles.


**12. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly a secular civilization, with religious elements not dominating the societal structure.
2. Cotton cultivation and textile production were prevalent during the Indus Valley Civilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While definitive conclusions about the religious beliefs of the Indus Valley Civilization remain somewhat debated due to limited textual evidence, archaeological findings suggest a relatively secular society where religious practices, while present, didn't appear to dominate the overall societal structure. Evidence of cotton cultivation and textile production is substantial, with cotton remnants found at various Indus Valley sites.  Therefore, both statements reflect the current understanding of the Indus Valley Civilization based on available archaeological evidence.  The other options misrepresent the current consensus on the nature of the Indus Valley Civilization's social and economic activities.  The evidence suggests a sophisticated urban civilization with diverse economic activities.


**13. With reference to cave paintings of the Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bagh Caves contain some of the best-preserved examples of Gupta-period cave paintings.
2. The Ajanta Caves are the only other surviving examples of Gupta-period cave paintings in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bagh Caves in Madhya Pradesh are renowned for their remarkable collection of Gupta-period cave paintings, showcasing vibrant colors and intricate details. While the Ajanta Caves also feature significant paintings, it's inaccurate to claim they are the *only* other surviving examples of Gupta-period paintings in India.  Other sites with remnants of Gupta-era paintings exist, though perhaps less well-preserved.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct, but statement 2 is an overstatement. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the existence or the significance of Gupta-era paintings at Bagh Caves or the uniqueness of Ajanta Caves in this context. The preservation and study of these paintings are vital for understanding the artistic and cultural landscape of the Gupta period.


**14. With reference to the location of famous temples in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple is located in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu.
2. The Vijaya-Vittala Temple with its 56 musical pillars is located in Hampi, Karnataka.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Virupaksha Temple is actually located in Hampi, Karnataka, not Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu.  The Vijaya-Vittala Temple, famous for its intricately carved 56 musical pillars, is indeed situated in Hampi. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect, while statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the locations of these significant temples.  The precise location of these temples is crucial for understanding their historical and architectural context.


**15. With reference to historical inscriptions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Allahabad Pillar inscription is primarily associated with Samudragupta.
2. The Badami rock inscription of Pulakesin I is dated in the Saka year 465.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Allahabad Pillar inscription, a significant historical record, is primarily associated with Samudragupta, the Gupta emperor, detailing his achievements and reign. The Badami rock inscription of Pulakesin I, the founder of the Chalukya dynasty, is indeed dated to the Saka year 465.  Therefore, both statements are correct.  All other options are incorrect, misrepresenting the historical context and dating of these important inscriptions. The study of these inscriptions offers valuable insights into the political and cultural history of their respective periods.


**16. With reference to the Angkor Wat temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial design and construction of Angkor Wat took place during the reign of Suryavarman II.
2. Angkor Wat is a Hindu temple complex located in present-day Thailand.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The magnificent Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia was indeed initiated and largely constructed during the reign of Suryavarman II (12th century CE), marking a high point of Khmer architecture and religious expression.  Angkor Wat is located in Cambodia, not Thailand.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct, while statement 2 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent either the historical period of its construction or its geographical location.  Understanding the historical context of Angkor Wat requires knowing its builder and location.


**17. With reference to the geographical indication (GI) status in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Banaras Brocades and Sarees have been granted GI status.
2. Rajasthani Daal-Bati-Churma has been granted GI status.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Banaras Brocades and Sarees have indeed received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, protecting their unique identity and craftsmanship. However, while Rajasthani Daal-Bati-Churma is a well-known dish, it has not yet been granted GI status as of the time of this question's creation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the GI status of these products.  The GI tag is a crucial element in protecting the intellectual property and market value of specific regional products.


**18. Consider the following statements about coffee varieties in India that have received GI status:**

1. Coorg Arabica Coffee has received GI status.
2. Wayanad Robusta Coffee has received GI status.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Coorg Arabica Coffee has been granted GI status, recognizing its unique characteristics and origin.  Wayanad Robusta Coffee, while a significant variety, does not currently hold a GI tag.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.  The other options inaccurately reflect the GI status of these Indian coffee varieties.  The GI tag protects the reputation and quality of specific regional products.


**19. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, consider the following statements:**

1. The GI Act provides for GI registration for goods only, not services.
2. The GI status is granted for an indefinite period without renewal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, is designed to protect the unique identity and origin of goods associated with specific regions.  It does *not* extend to services.  Moreover, the GI tag is granted for a specific period, typically 10 years, and requires renewal to maintain its protection. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.  All other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope and duration of protection under the GI Act.  Understanding the details of this Act is important for protecting regional products and their associated cultural heritage.



**1. With reference to the architectural features introduced by Babur in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's arrival marked the first introduction of gunpowder technology to the Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Timurid architectural style, characterized by the extensive use of arches and domes, was significantly established in India during Babur's reign.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's arrival did contribute to the further spread and use of gunpowder in India, its introduction predates his arrival. Gunpowder technology had already existed in India, albeit perhaps not as advanced as in other regions.  The use of gunpowder in warfare and fireworks had been documented in India for centuries before Babur's time.

Statement 2 is correct. Babur, a Timurid ruler, brought with him the architectural aesthetics of Central Asia, which heavily featured arches and domes. Though arches and domes existed in India before, Babur's architectural projects significantly popularized and influenced their use in subsequent Mughal architecture and beyond. His buildings, though comparatively few compared to later Mughal emperors, set the stage for the evolution of this style in the Indian context.  The introduction of Central Asian architectural styles, including the refined use of arches and domes, marked a significant development in India's architectural landscape.  The statement accurately reflects this influence.


**2. With reference to the earliest examples of Indian art and archaeological history, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar is older than the rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli.
2. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves predates the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rock-cut Elephant at Dhauli, attributed to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), is considerably older than the Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, which belongs to the Kalinga architectural style and was constructed much later (likely between the 11th and 13th centuries CE).  The chronological placement of these structures is well-established in historical records and archaeological findings.

Statement 2 is correct. The Varaha Image at Udayagiri Caves, dating back to the Gupta period (5th century CE), is indeed older than the rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, created by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th century CE. The stylistic differences and established dating techniques confirm this chronological sequence. The Gupta period art displays a distinct style compared to the Pallava style, further supporting the statement's accuracy.


**3. With reference to the location of places of pilgrimage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Omkareshwar is located in the Satmala Hills, while Srisailam is situated in the Nallamala Hills.
2. Pushkar is correctly matched with the Aravalli Hills.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Omkareshwar, a significant Shiva temple, is located on an island in the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh, and is indeed associated with the Satmala Hills. Srisailam, another important pilgrimage site, is located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh.  The geographical locations of these pilgrimage sites are well-documented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Pushkar is located in Rajasthan, it's situated in the Thar Desert and is not associated with the Aravalli Hills. The Aravalli Range lies to the west of Pushkar, but the temple's immediate geographical context is different.  The precise geographical location and surrounding landscape of Pushkar are clearly distinct from the Aravalli Hills.


**4. With reference to Buddhist shrines in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in Ladakh.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is actually located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, not the Zanskar Valley. The geographical placement of this significant Buddhist site is well-established.  Confusing the Spiti and Zanskar valleys is a common error, highlighting the need for precise geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alchi Temple Complex is indeed situated in Ladakh, a region known for its rich Buddhist heritage and unique architectural style.  This fact is well-documented and widely known. The Alchi site's location in Ladakh is undeniable and serves as a significant example of Buddhist art and architecture in the region.


**5. With reference to the term "Panchayatan" in Indian cultural history, consider the following statements:**

1. Panchayatan exclusively refers to a style of temple construction.
2. Panchayatan is only associated with Hindu religious practices.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panchayatan primarily refers to a specific architectural style in temple construction, where a central shrine is surrounded by four smaller shrines, representing a distinct pattern in temple layout. This architectural feature is well-documented in the study of Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Panchayatan is predominantly associated with Hindu temple architecture, its application isn't exclusively limited to Hindu religious practices.  The architectural principle of a central shrine surrounded by smaller ones can be found in other religious structures as well, demonstrating that the term's usage isn't strictly confined to Hinduism.  The statement oversimplifies the broader context of Panchayatan.


**6. With reference to famous works of sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is found at the Ellora Caves.
2. The Descent of the Ganga is a famous sculpture located at Mamallapuram.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ellora Caves contain significant Buddhist sculptures, the grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is located at Ajanta Caves.  Confusing Ajanta and Ellora is a common mistake, underscoring the need for precise knowledge about these sites.

Statement 2 is correct. The Descent of the Ganga (Arjuna's Penance) is indeed a famous rock-cut sculpture at Mamallapuram, a renowned site for Pallava-era art and architecture. The scale and detail of this sculpture make it a significant example of Pallava artistic achievement.


**7. With reference to the Ibadat Khana of Fatehpur Sikri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana was primarily used as Akbar's personal prayer chamber.
2. The Ibadat Khana was exclusively used for religious discussions amongst Sunni Muslims.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ibadat Khana was used for prayer by Akbar, its primary function was as a venue for religious discussions and debates. It wasn't solely a personal prayer chamber. Akbar's religious policies promoted discussions with scholars of various faiths and this was a crucial aspect of the Ibadat Khana's purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's religious policies and the Ibadat Khana's purpose were to foster discussions and debates among scholars from diverse religious backgrounds, not exclusively Sunni Muslims.  The Ibadat Khana was a key component of Akbar's attempts at religious synthesis and dialogue.


**8. With reference to the history of Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The caves at Badami are the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India.
2. The Barabar rock-cut caves were originally constructed for Ajivikas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Badami caves are significant examples of rock-cut architecture, they are not the oldest. The Barabar caves, dating back to the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), are considered older.  The chronological sequence of these rock-cut sites is critical to understanding the evolution of this architectural style in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Barabar caves were indeed originally built for the Ajivikas, a heterodox sect during the Mauryan period.  This is supported by historical records and inscriptions. The association of these caves with the Ajivika sect is a well-established fact in the study of Indian history.


**9. With reference to places known for mural paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Ajanta caves are renowned for their mural paintings.
2. Lepakshi temple is famous for its mural paintings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ajanta caves are world-famous for their exquisite and well-preserved mural paintings, representing a significant aspect of Buddhist art in India. The quality and style of these paintings are unique and highly valued.

Statement 2 is correct. Lepakshi temple in Andhra Pradesh also boasts impressive and vibrant mural paintings, showcasing a different artistic tradition and style compared to Ajanta.   The murals at Lepakshi are an important example of South Indian art.


**10. With reference to the characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization possessed grand palaces and temples comparable to those of later civilizations.
2. The Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization had sophisticated urban planning and impressive structures, evidence of grand palaces and temples comparable to later civilizations is limited.  The nature of their buildings and societal organization differs significantly from later civilizations.  The interpretation of archaeological findings regarding the scale and purpose of their structures is still debated.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization worshipped both male and female deities, indicating a complex religious system.  The discovery of various artifacts depicting both male and female figures supports this understanding.  The presence of both masculine and feminine deities in their iconography is a well-accepted aspect of Indus religion.


**11. With reference to the difference between Chaityas and Viharas in Buddhist rock-cut caves, consider the following statements:**

1. A Chaitya is a place of worship, while a Vihara is a dwelling place for monks.
2.  The term "Chaitya" refers to a stupa located at the far end of a cave, with the Vihara being the axial hall.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In Buddhist rock-cut architecture, a Chaitya is indeed a prayer hall or place of worship, typically featuring a stupa at one end.  A Vihara serves as a monastery or dwelling place for monks. This distinction is fundamental to understanding Buddhist cave architecture.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that Chaityas often contain stupas, but it's not always at the far end, nor is it the defining feature of the difference between a Chaitya and Vihara.  The primary distinction lies in their function as a place of worship versus a dwelling space. The location of the stupa within a Chaitya is variable; the statement oversimplifies a nuanced architectural aspect.


**12. With reference to the three main styles of Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are primarily classified based on their geographical distribution.
2.  The Nagara style is characterized by a curvilinear shikhara, while the Dravida style features a pyramidal structure.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles of temple architecture are broadly categorized based on their regional origins and prevalence: Nagara in North India, Dravida in South India, and Vesara in a transitional zone between the two. Geographical distribution is a key factor in their classification.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nagara style is characterized by a curvilinear or curved shikhara (tower), while the Dravida style is known for its pyramidal or stepped structure.  These distinct architectural features are fundamental to identifying these styles.


**13. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was primarily a secular civilization with limited evidence of religious dominance.
2.  The Indus Valley Civilization used cotton for textile manufacturing.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While religious elements are present in the Indus Valley Civilization, the overall societal structure appears less overtly religious compared to later civilizations.  Religious practices seem to have been integrated into daily life rather than dominating public life in a way that we see in later periods.  The evidence suggests a more secular orientation compared to later Indian civilizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological findings indicate the use of cotton for textile production in the Indus Valley Civilization.  The discovery of cotton fibers and tools associated with textile manufacturing confirms this.


**14. With reference to the location of surviving examples of Gupta period cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bagh Caves contain the only surviving example of Gupta period cave paintings other than Ajanta.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi, Karnataka.  Confusing Hampi with Bhadrachalam, which is known for another significant temple, is a common error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vijaya-Vittala Temple with its famous musical pillars is located in Hampi, Karnataka, not Belur.  Belur is known for its own distinct Hoysaleswara Temple.

1. The Satavahanas primarily used lead for their coins, with silver coins being a rarity, and also used an alloy of silver and copper called 'potin'.
2. The Gupta gold coins often depicted the king engaged in various activities, such as performing sacrifices or playing the veena, while the reverse side featured goddesses like Lakshmi or the queen.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Satavahana dynasty, known for its rule in the Deccan region, predominantly utilized lead for its coinage. Silver coins were less common, and they also employed an alloy known as 'potin,' a mixture of silver and copper. This reflects their economic realities and resource availability at the time.  The lack of artistic sophistication in their coinage, despite their historical significance as a source of dynastic information, is also a noteworthy aspect.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Gupta Empire's coinage, especially gold coins, is celebrated for its artistic merit and the detailed depictions they offer.  The obverse frequently showed the king participating in various activities, symbolic of his role and power. These included religious rituals (like performing sacrifices or making oblations), playing musical instruments (like the veena), or depictions of hunting or warfare. The reverse side commonly featured images of goddesses, notably Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and prosperity), or even the queen herself. This reflects the Gupta period's emphasis on both imperial power and religious themes in its art and iconography.  The use of Sanskrit inscriptions on these coins, a first in Indian numismatics, further underlines their importance.


**2. With reference to the iconography and symbolism in Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ujjain symbol, a cross with four circles at the ends of the intersecting lines, was a common feature on Satavahana coins and symbolized their religious beliefs.
2. The four animals (lion, elephant, bull, and horse) on the abacus of the Sarnath pillar represent the four cardinal directions and, in Buddhist context, symbolize the attainment of enlightenment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While the Ujjain symbol *was* a common feature on Satavahana coins, its direct connection to their religious beliefs is not definitively established.  The symbol's origins and precise meaning remain debated among scholars, with some suggesting astronomical or other symbolic interpretations rather than a purely religious one. Therefore, presenting it as a direct representation of their religious beliefs is an oversimplification and a potential distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The four animals on the Sarnath pillar's abacus are indeed widely interpreted as representing the four cardinal directions.  However, the deeper Buddhist symbolism goes beyond mere geographical representation. In the Buddhist context, these animals are often seen as symbolic of the attainment of enlightenment, with each animal representing a specific aspect of the Buddha's journey or qualities associated with enlightenment. The lion, for instance, often represents the Buddha's courage and power. The other animals also carry symbolic weight in Buddhist traditions.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are three main styles of Indian temple architecture, each characterized by distinct features in their design and construction.
2. The Chalukyan dynasty, known for its contributions to temple architecture, primarily used the Nagara style in its constructions, demonstrating a preference for the northern style.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are indeed three major classifications of Indian temple architecture.  These styles are distinguished by their structural characteristics, such as the shikhara (tower) design, the overall layout, and decorative elements.  The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, is characterized by its curvilinear shikhara, while the Dravida style, common in South India, features a pyramidal structure. The Vesara style represents a hybrid, blending elements from both the Nagara and Dravida styles and often found in regions where these styles overlapped geographically.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chalukyan dynasty, while renowned for its significant contributions to temple architecture, did not primarily use the Nagara style.  Their architectural style, often referred to as the Chalukyan style, is a distinct regional variation that incorporates elements from both the Dravida and Nagara styles, showcasing a unique synthesis of these traditions.  Attributing their primary style to the Nagara style is a simplification and inaccurate representation of their architectural legacy.


**4. With reference to the spread of Indian culture abroad, consider the following statements:**

1. The Romas, while traveling to various parts of the world, carried with them significant aspects of Indian culture, contributing to cultural exchange in regions like Europe.
2. The Kalinga dynasty established direct trade relations with Sri Lanka, facilitating the exchange of cultural practices and religious ideas between the two regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Romas, also known as Romani people, are believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent. Their migration to various parts of Europe and other regions involved the transmission of certain cultural practices and traditions. While the extent of their cultural impact is debated, their presence in various parts of the world does testify to the spread of certain cultural elements from the Indian subcontinent.  The specifics of their cultural transmission are complex and involve interactions with other cultures along their migratory routes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kalinga dynasty, known for its maritime prowess and trade activities, had established direct trade connections with Sri Lanka. This facilitated the exchange of goods, but also of cultural and religious ideas.  The spread of Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka, for instance, was significantly aided by these maritime trade routes and the political connections established by the Kalinga dynasty.  The exchange involved not just material goods, but also religious and cultural practices, leading to a reciprocal influence on the cultural landscapes of both regions.


**5. With reference to the development of Indian science and technology, consider the following statements:**

The precision of his calculations, considering the limited technological resources available at the time, is a testament to the sophistication of ancient Indian astronomy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Kanad, an ancient Indian philosopher, is credited with developing a rudimentary form of atomic theory. His concept of *anu* (atom), describing matter as composed of indivisible particles, predates the similar work of John Dalton by many centuries.  While the details and scientific rigor differ from modern atomic theory, Kanad's insights demonstrate an early contemplation of the fundamental structure of matter in ancient Indian thought.  This highlights the early development of philosophical and scientific ideas in ancient India that were later independently rediscovered in the West.

2. Jahangir's coinage often featured couplets, sometimes incorporating the name of his wife, Noor Jahan, and also included depictions of zodiac signs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar, known for his religious policies and syncretic approach, introduced the Ilahi coins as part of his efforts to promote 'Din-i-Illahi,' a new religious creed he attempted to establish.  These coins were indeed of high denomination, equivalent to 10 rupees, and bore the inscription emphasizing the greatness of God, reflecting the religious message he sought to convey. The high value of the coin reflects its intended use and Akbar's ambition to spread his religious ideas.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Jahangir, a patron of art and culture, introduced several distinctive features in his coinage.  His coins often included couplets, reflecting his interest in Persian poetry and literature.  He also sometimes incorporated the name of his wife, Noor Jahan, a powerful figure in his court, into the coin's inscriptions.  Furthermore, some of his coins featured depictions of zodiac signs, showcasing an interest in astrology and reflecting his personal preferences and beliefs.  The inclusion of couplets and zodiac signs showcases a more personalized approach to royal iconography compared to his predecessors.


**7. With reference to the cultural significance of festivals in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pushkar Fair, one of the world's largest camel and cattle fairs, is held annually in Rajasthan and predominantly focuses on trading activities, with cultural events playing a secondary role.
2. The Hornbill Festival, celebrated in Nagaland, is a 10-day festival that showcases the vibrant tribal culture of the region, including traditional dances, music, and crafts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Pushkar Fair is indeed one of the world's largest camel and cattle fairs, held annually in Rajasthan, it is inaccurate to say that trading activities are the primary focus.  The fair has evolved into a major cultural event, attracting thousands of tourists and showcasing various aspects of Rajasthani culture, including traditional dances, competitions (like moustache and turban-tying), and other festive activities.  While trading remains a significant component, characterizing it as the *predominant* focus overlooks the substantial cultural significance of the event.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hornbill Festival, celebrated in Nagaland, is a major cultural event that brings together various Naga tribes.  The 10-day festival is a vibrant showcase of Naga culture, featuring traditional dances, music, crafts, and other cultural performances.  The festival highlights the rich diversity of Naga tribes, their traditions, and their unique cultural identities, making it a significant event for both the local community and tourists.  The festival's duration and the range of activities demonstrate its importance as a cultural celebration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, is indeed conferred on a maximum of three individuals annually.  The Prime Minister of India makes the recommendations for the award to the President, who then makes the final selection.  This process reflects the high level of consideration and the importance attached to this prestigious award.  The limit on the number of recipients underscores the exclusivity of the honor.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. The Padma Awards, introduced in 1954, are conferred annually, with a few exceptions (as mentioned in the text).  They indeed recognize exceptional achievements in a wide range of fields, encompassing arts, social work, public affairs, science, and other areas.  The statement accurately reflects that posthumous awards are rare, reflecting the general preference for recognizing individuals during their lifetime, although exceptions are made in exceptional circumstances. The exceptions to the annual conferment are also factually correct.

This reflects their shared importance in showcasing the artistic and architectural achievements of India's history and their unique contribution to world heritage. Their simultaneous inclusion emphasizes their collective significance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur and the Airavateshvara Temple at Darasuram, both declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1987, are indeed prime examples of the Dravidian style of temple architecture.  This architectural style, prevalent in South India, is characterized by specific features, and these temples are considered masterpieces of this style, showcasing its grandeur and sophistication.  Their inclusion highlights the significance of the Dravidian architectural tradition within the broader context of world heritage.


**10. With reference to the Indian Handicrafts, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tikuli art form of Bihar, characterized by its unique decorative glass beads, has indeed faced a decline due to the impact of industrialization. Traditional techniques have been threatened, leading to a loss of this specific craft. However, efforts are underway to revive this art form, including adaptations that use contemporary mediums like glazed hardboards, to keep the tradition alive in modern contexts.  This highlights the challenges faced by traditional crafts in the face of industrialization and the importance of preservation efforts.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kalamkari, a traditional fabric painting technique, is indeed primarily practiced in Andhra Pradesh. The technique involves hand-painting on cloth using natural vegetable dyes to create intricate patterns and vibrant colors. This reflects the region's rich artistic heritage and the continued practice of traditional techniques. The use of natural dyes is a key feature, highlighting the sustainable aspects of this craft.  The statement correctly identifies the region of practice and the significant characteristic of the technique.


**1. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The largest known Harappan site is located in present-day Haryana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rakhigarhi in Haryana is widely considered the largest known site of the Indus Valley Civilization, surpassing even Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in terms of its size and extent.  Extensive excavations have revealed a substantial urban settlement, including granaries, cemeteries, drainage systems, and other features indicative of a well-developed urban center.  This makes it a significant site for understanding the scale and complexity of Harappan urban planning.

Statement 2 is also correct. While horse remains are debated in some Harappan sites, the westernmost site of Suktagandor in Pakistan has yielded the earliest confirmed skeletal remains of horses from the civilization.  This discovery is crucial because it provides evidence for the presence of horses in the Harappan region, offering insights into their domestication and role in the society, potentially impacting trade, transportation, or even warfare. The presence of horses in the westernmost part of the civilization's geographical range is particularly significant for understanding the extent of its interactions and trade networks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is the Bodhisattva ideal.  Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who, instead of entering Nirvana, choose to remain in the world to guide and assist others on their path to enlightenment. This selfless dedication to the welfare of all beings is a defining feature of Mahayana Buddhism, distinguishing it from other Buddhist traditions.  The Bodhisattva path emphasizes compassion, empathy, and the accumulation of merit through actions aimed at benefiting sentient beings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The deification of the Buddha, where he is considered a divine being rather than a historical figure, is a characteristic of *Mahayana* Buddhism, not Hinayana (Theravada) Buddhism.  Hinayana Buddhism, in contrast, focuses on the individual's path to enlightenment through self-discipline and meditation, emphasizing the teachings and example of the historical Buddha.  The concept of a deified Buddha is a significant theological divergence between these two major branches of Buddhism.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Vittala Temple at Hampi is known for its elaborate stone chariot.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kalyana mandapas are indeed a significant architectural feature in South Indian temple complexes, their prominence is associated with the Vijayanagara Empire, not the Chalukyas. The Vijayanagara rulers, known for their grand temple construction projects, incorporated Kalyana mandapas as integral parts of many of their temple complexes.  The Chalukyas had their own distinct architectural style.


Statement 2 is correct. The Vittala Temple at Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is renowned for its intricately carved stone chariot, a masterpiece of Vijayanagara architecture. This majestic structure, along with other architectural elements within the temple complex, showcases the advanced sculptural and engineering skills of the Vijayanagara artisans. The stone chariot is a particularly striking example of the empire's artistic achievements and its unique architectural style.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Emperor Akbar shifted the emphasis in art from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and albums.
2.  Mian Tansen, one of Akbar's Navratnas, is credited with inventing several new ragas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar patronized the arts extensively, and his reign saw a flourishing of illustrated manuscripts, the shift towards individual portraits and albums as the primary focus in Mughal art occurred during the reign of Jahangir, Akbar's son. Jahangir, himself a keen painter and art connoisseur, actively promoted this stylistic change.


Statement 2 is correct.  Mian Tansen, a renowned musician in Akbar's court, is indeed credited with composing numerous dhrupads on Hindu deities and creating several new ragas. His contributions significantly enriched the Hindustani classical music tradition, reflecting the cultural synthesis promoted by Akbar's reign. He was a prominent member of Akbar's Navratnas and his musical talents were highly valued by the Mughal emperor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Saint Nimbarka's period is generally placed in the 12th-13th centuries, considerably earlier than the reign of Shah Jahan (17th century).  There is scholarly debate about the precise dates, but the consensus places Nimbarka's life well before the Mughal emperor.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624), a prominent figure in the Naqshbandi Sufi order, was known for his opposition to Akbar's religious syncretism. Saint Kabir (15th Century) predates Sirhindi, and thus could not have been influenced by him.  Kabir's teachings were rooted in a blend of Hindu and Sufi traditions, but his ideas developed independently of Sirhindi's later theological perspectives.


**6.  With reference to ancient Indian architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Barabar caves were initially constructed for the Ajivikas during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya.
2. The Badami caves represent the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Barabar caves in Bihar, renowned for their remarkable rock-cut architecture, were indeed constructed during the Mauryan period, specifically commissioned for the Ajivika sect by Emperor Ashoka's grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya.  These caves exemplify the sophisticated rock-cutting techniques of the Mauryan era and provide important evidence for the religious landscape of that period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Badami caves are significant rock-cut cave temples, they are not the oldest surviving examples in India. The Barabar caves predate them, representing an earlier stage in the development of rock-cut architecture in India. The Badami caves, however, are important for showcasing the architectural styles and religious beliefs of the Chalukya dynasty.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A defining characteristic of the Indus Valley Civilization is the apparent lack of monumental structures like grand palaces or temples, unlike later civilizations.  While large-scale public works like planned cities and drainage systems existed, evidence for large-scale religious or palatial structures is limited.  This absence of monumental architecture has led to various interpretations about the social and political organization of the civilization.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological findings from Indus Valley Civilization sites show evidence of the worship of both male and female deities.  The iconic "Priest-King" statue from Mohenjo-daro is an example of a male deity, while various figurines and seals depict Mother Goddess figures.  The presence of both male and female deities suggests a complex religious system with diverse beliefs and practices.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles are the three main styles of *temple architecture* in India, not classical dance.  Each style is characterized by distinct features, reflecting regional variations in building techniques and aesthetic preferences.  Indian classical dance forms have their own distinct traditions and regional styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lingaraja Temple, a magnificent example of Kalinga architecture, is indeed located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.  This temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a prominent landmark and a significant example of the architectural achievements of the region.  Its intricate carvings and imposing structure showcase the artistic skills of the Kalinga artisans.


**9. With reference to Buddhist cave architecture, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In Buddhist cave architecture, the terms Chaitya and Vihara have distinct meanings.  Chaityas were prayer halls or places of worship, often featuring a stupa at the far end.  Viharas, on the other hand, were monasteries or dwelling places for monks.  The two types of caves served different functions within the monastic complex.


Statement 2 is correct. The Ajanta caves in Maharashtra are indeed renowned for their exquisitely preserved mural paintings.  These paintings, dating back to the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE, depict scenes from the Jataka tales, Buddhist narratives that illustrate the previous lives of the Buddha.  The Ajanta murals are a significant artistic achievement, showcasing the high level of artistic skill and the importance of Buddhist patronage during that period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court, did indeed write Indica, which, despite its fragmented survival, provides valuable insights into the Mauryan Empire's social structure, political administration, and economic systems during Chandragupta Maurya's reign.  Though some accounts are likely colored by Greek perspectives, it offers a unique outsider's view of ancient India.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Ibn Battuta's Rihla, while touching upon religious aspects, provides a far more comprehensive account of India's social, economic, and political life during his travels in the 14th century.  His detailed observations cover various aspects of daily life, trade, governance, and cultural practices, offering rich insights into the social fabric of the time.  He was particularly observant of details of daily life, which makes his account a valuable historical source.

Babur's invasion of India in 1526 marked a turning point in the subcontinent's history, not only politically but also architecturally and technologically. While gunpowder was present in India before Babur's arrival, his campaigns and the subsequent Mughal rule saw its wider adoption and refinement in military applications, making statement 1 correct.  More significantly, Babur, hailing from the Timurid dynasty, introduced and popularized the Timurid architectural style. This style, originating in Central Asia, was characterized by its masterful use of arches and domes, a stark contrast to the prevailing architectural styles in India.  The construction of mosques, tombs, and other structures under Babur's patronage showcased this style, significantly influencing subsequent Mughal architecture and setting the stage for its widespread adoption in India. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are true. Option (d) is incorrect as it contradicts the historical evidence.  The introduction of gunpowder and the Timurid architectural style are both well-documented aspects of Babur's impact on India.


**2. With reference to early Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar predates the rock-cut elephant at Dhauli.
2. Rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram were constructed before the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The chronology of these structures is crucial to understanding the evolution of Indian art.  The rock-cut elephant at Dhauli, Odisha, is associated with the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE), representing one of the earliest examples of rock-cut sculpture in India. The Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, on the other hand, belongs to the Kalinga architectural style and was constructed much later, primarily between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. This makes statement 1 incorrect. Similarly, the Varaha image at Udayagiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh, dates back to the Gupta period (5th century CE). The rock-cut monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, were created by the Pallava dynasty during the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Thus, the Varaha image predates the Mahabalipuram monuments, making statement 2 incorrect. Consequently, neither statement is correct, making option (d) the appropriate choice. The question highlights the need for precise chronological understanding in Indian art history.


**3. Consider the following pairs of pilgrimage sites and their locations:**

1. Srisailam is located in the Nallamala Hills.
2. Omkareshwar is situated in the Satmala Hills.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of geographical locations of important pilgrimage sites in India. Srisailam, a significant Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva, is indeed located in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh. This makes statement 1 correct. However, Omkareshwar, another important Hindu pilgrimage site located on an island in the Narmada river, is not situated in the Satmala Hills.  It's located in Madhya Pradesh. This makes statement 2 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making option (a) the right answer. The incorrect pairing in statement 2 serves as a distractor, emphasizing the importance of accurate geographical knowledge for UPSC aspirants.


**4. With reference to Buddhist sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is located in the Zanskar Valley.
2. The Alchi Temple Complex is situated in the Spiti Valley.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of geographically specific Buddhist sites in India. The Tabo Monastery and Temple Complex is a significant Buddhist site, but it is located in the Spiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh, not the Zanskar Valley.  The Alchi Temple Complex is another important Buddhist site, and it is located in Ladakh, not the Spiti Valley. Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct option.  The incorrect geographical locations are designed as distractors to test the candidate's precise knowledge of these sites.

1. Panchayatan primarily refers to a style of temple construction characterized by a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question probes understanding of a key architectural and cultural term.  Panchayatan is primarily known in the context of temple architecture, referring to a specific plan where a central shrine is surrounded by four smaller shrines, often arranged symmetrically at the cardinal points. This arrangement symbolizes the five elements or deities. This makes statement 1 correct. However, Panchayatan does not refer to a distinct religious sect.  While it might be associated with certain schools of thought or regional traditions within Hinduism, it is not a sectarian designation in itself. This makes statement 2 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making option (a) the appropriate answer.


**6. With reference to famous works of sculpture and their locations, consider the following statements:**

1. A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana is found in the Ellora Caves.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific sculptures and their locations.  A grand image of Buddha's Mahaparinirvana (death) is indeed a significant artwork, but it is located in the Ajanta Caves, not Ellora.  This makes statement 1 incorrect.  Arjuna's Penance, also known as the Descent of the Ganga, is a famous and massive rock relief sculpture located at Mahabalipuram (Mamallapuram), Tamil Nadu. This makes statement 2 correct.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer. The incorrect location in statement 1 serves as a potential distractor.

(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of a significant historical building and its purpose. While the Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri served as a place of private prayer for Akbar, its primary function was as a venue for religious discussions. Akbar, known for his religious tolerance and interest in various faiths, used this space to engage in debates and dialogues with scholars representing diverse religious traditions, including Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making option (c) the appropriate answer.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of the chronology and purpose of important rock-cut caves. The Barabar Caves in Bihar are indeed among the earliest surviving examples of rock-cut architecture in India. They were constructed during the Mauryan period, specifically during the reign of Ashoka's grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, and were initially intended for the Ajivikas, a heterodox sect. This makes statement 1 correct.  However, the caves at Badami in Karnataka, while significant examples of rock-cut architecture, are not the oldest.  Other rock-cut caves predate them. This makes statement 2 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making option (a) the right answer.


**9. With reference to places known for mural paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Ajanta Caves are renowned for their extensive and well-preserved mural paintings.

This question assesses knowledge of the artistic features of specific historical sites.  The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra are indeed famous for their remarkably preserved murals depicting scenes from the Jataka tales and other Buddhist narratives.  These murals are considered masterpieces of ancient Indian art. This makes statement 1 correct. However, the Sanchi Stupa in Madhya Pradesh, while a significant Buddhist monument, is primarily known for its stupa architecture and sculptural decorations, not for extensive mural paintings.  This makes statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making option (a) the right answer.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of the societal and religious aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.  While the Indus Valley Civilization was highly advanced for its time, with sophisticated urban planning and infrastructure, evidence of monumental structures like grand palaces and temples comparable to later periods is limited.  The scale and nature of their buildings were different from later civilizations. This makes statement 1 incorrect. However, archaeological findings suggest the worship of both male and female deities, indicating a complex religious system.  This makes statement 2 correct. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of the functional differences between two types of Buddhist rock-cut caves. Chaityas were large prayer halls or assembly halls, usually containing a stupa at one end, serving as places of worship.  Viharas, on the other hand, functioned as monasteries, providing living quarters for Buddhist monks. This makes statement 1 incorrect and statement 2 correct. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer.
