**1. Consider the following statements regarding the socio-political movements during Aurangzeb's reign:**

1. The Jat movement, primarily agrarian in nature, challenged Mughal land revenue policies and culminated in the establishment of an independent Jat state.
2. The Sikh movement, unlike the Jat and Rajput movements, was significantly influenced by religious factors, ultimately leading to the formation of a distinct Sikh polity.
3. The Afghan uprisings, characterized by tribal conflicts and the desire for regional autonomy, temporarily eased Mughal pressure on the Maratha kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the socio-political landscape during Aurangzeb's rule.  The Jat movement, rooted in peasant grievances over land revenue, evolved into a powerful rebellion under leaders like Gokla and Rajaram.  Their eventual success in establishing an independent state underscores the significant impact of agrarian discontent on Mughal authority.  The Sikh movement, while also having economic and political dimensions, was distinctly shaped by religious fervor and the leadership of Guru Tegh Bahadur, setting it apart from the primarily secular nature of the Jat and Rajput rebellions.  The Afghan uprisings, fueled by tribal rivalries and aspirations for independence, strategically diverted Mughal resources and military attention away from other fronts, notably providing crucial respite to Shivaji and the Marathas during a critical phase of their struggle.  Therefore, option (d) is the most accurate and comprehensive representation of these interconnected historical events.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions in Mughal India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread poverty among ordinary peasants, artisans, and laborers, contrasting sharply with the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes.
2. The staple diet of the common people comprised rice, millets, pulses, and in some regions, fish and meat, with ghee and oil being relatively inexpensive.
3. Land ownership was relatively secure, with peasants retaining their land as long as land revenue was paid, and inheritance rights were generally upheld.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Accounts from European traders and travelers to Mughal India consistently documented a stark disparity between the affluence of the ruling elite and the widespread poverty experienced by the majority of the population, comprising peasants, artisans, and laborers.  This observation is supported by descriptions of inadequate clothing and housing prevalent among the common people.  The typical diet of the ordinary populace included rice, millets, pulses, and regional variations like fish and meat, indicating a varied, though basic, food supply.  Ghee and oil were relatively affordable, contributing to the nutritional intake of the poor.  While land ownership wasn't absolute and subject to revenue demands, the basic right to retain land as long as revenue was paid and inheritance laws generally protected land transmission to heirs, providing a degree of security for landowning peasants. Thus, all three statements accurately reflect aspects of the economic and social realities of Mughal India.


**3. With reference to the cultural interactions during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement, spearheaded by figures like Kabir and Nanak, promoted a syncretic religious philosophy emphasizing monotheism and challenging the rigid caste system.
2. Sufi saints, influenced by the monistic ideas of Ibn Arabi, actively engaged with Bhakti traditions, fostering interfaith dialogue and contributing to a common platform for religious understanding.
3. Sanskrit literature, despite the rise of Persian as an administrative language, continued to thrive, producing significant works in philosophy, poetry, and other fields, largely independent of Islamic influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on devotion to a single god and its rejection of caste hierarchies, played a crucial role in fostering religious tolerance and interaction.  Kabir and Nanak, central figures of this movement, actively challenged the rigid social structures of their time.  Sufi saints, influenced by Ibn Arabi's concept of the unity of being (Wahdat al-Wujud), also promoted a tolerant and inclusive religious philosophy.  Their interactions with Bhakti saints contributed to a climate of interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding.  However, while Sanskrit literature continued to flourish during the medieval period, it remained largely separate from Islamic literary traditions.  There were some instances of translation, but the bulk of Sanskrit literature shows little direct engagement with Islamic themes or ideas.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 accurately depict the dynamics of cultural exchange, while statement 3 overstates the level of integration between Sanskrit and Islamic literary traditions.


**4. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani, known for his multilingualism and patronage of learning, significantly increased the participation of Hindus in the administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2.  Mahmud Gawan, a prominent prime minister, expanded the Bahmani kingdom through military conquests, notably gaining control of crucial western coastal ports like Dabhol and Goa.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom’s expansion was solely driven by religious zeal, aiming to establish Islamic dominance over the Deccan region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign was marked by a notable inclusion of Hindus in administrative roles, particularly within the revenue system, reflecting a pragmatic approach to governance rather than strict religious orthodoxy.  This policy aimed to balance the influence of foreign elements within the administration.  Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister saw significant military successes, expanding the kingdom's territory and control over vital coastal trade routes through the acquisition of ports like Dabhol and Goa.  However, the assertion that the Bahmani kingdom's expansion was solely motivated by religious zeal is inaccurate. While the Bahmani kingdom was undoubtedly a Muslim state, its expansionist policies were driven by a complex interplay of political, economic, and strategic factors, with control over trade routes and resources being equally important.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key aspects of the Bahmani Kingdom's history, while statement 3 presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of its expansionist motives.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the Vijayanagara Empire's peak in power and wealth, as evidenced by the accounts of numerous foreign travelers who described its vast size, military strength, and opulence.
2. The Vijayanagara rulers maintained a powerful navy, enabling them to exert influence over maritime trade and potentially extract tribute from various coastal kingdoms in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.
3. The city of Vijayanagara was renowned for its intricate multi-layered fortifications, extensive markets, and the sophisticated canal system that supplied water to its various sections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Accounts from foreign travelers during the reign of Deva Raya II consistently portray the Vijayanagara Empire as a powerful and wealthy state.  These accounts highlight the empire's vast size, substantial military, and the opulent lifestyle of its rulers.  The empire's significant maritime power is suggested by its ability to project influence over Sri Lanka and potentially extract tribute from Southeast Asian kingdoms, although the extent of this tribute remains debated.  The accounts of foreign travelers also emphasize the sophisticated urban planning of Vijayanagara, highlighting its impressive multi-layered fortifications, extensive markets, and the well-developed canal system that provided water to the city's various quarters.  All three statements accurately reflect the impressive scale, wealth, and sophistication of the Vijayanagara Empire during this period, making option (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola Empire's rise to prominence involved consolidating power in the Tamil region by subduing rival kingdoms like the Pallavas and Pandyas, though they faced significant challenges from the Rashtrakutas.
2. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, considered the greatest Chola rulers, expanded the empire's territory through military conquests in South India and beyond, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
3. The Chola Empire's naval strength played a crucial role in its expansion and control over maritime trade routes, facilitating economic and cultural interactions with Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chola Empire's emergence as a dominant power in South India involved overcoming challenges from existing kingdoms such as the Pallavas and Pandyas.  While they initially faced setbacks from the Rashtrakutas, the Cholas ultimately consolidated their control over the Tamil region.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, through a series of successful military campaigns, significantly expanded the empire's reach, conquering territories in South India and extending their influence to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  The Chola navy was a critical component of their success, enabling them to control vital maritime trade routes and facilitating extensive interactions with Southeast Asia, contributing to the empire's economic prosperity and cultural influence.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Chola Empire's rise, expansion, and impact.


**7. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The basic unit of administration in the Delhi Sultanate was the village, with hereditary village headmen (mugaddams) and accountants (patwaris) playing crucial roles.
2.  Provincial administration under the Delhi Sultanate involved the appointment of governors (uparikas) responsible for revenue collection and maintaining law and order within their respective provinces.
3. The Iqta system, introduced during the Delhi Sultanate, involved assigning territories to military commanders in lieu of salaries, leading to a decentralized system of governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The village formed the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate's administrative structure.  Hereditary village officials, such as the mugaddam (headman) and the patwari (accountant), played vital roles in local governance and revenue collection.  The Sultanate's provincial administration relied on governors (uparikas) who were responsible for managing their respective provinces, encompassing revenue collection and maintaining law and order.  The Iqta system, a significant feature of the Sultanate's administration, involved granting territories to military commanders in lieu of salaries. This system, while contributing to the empire's military strength, also resulted in a degree of decentralization in governance.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect key elements of the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate.


**8. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, with significant growth in trade facilitated by improved communications and a stable currency system.
2. While the majority of the population consisted of peasants who often faced hardships due to famines and wars, a more prosperous section of owner-cultivators existed, dominating village panchayats.
3.  The Delhi Sultanate period saw the introduction or significant improvement of various crafts and techniques, including the rahat (Persian wheel) for irrigation, paper-making, and improved weaving techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Delhi Sultanate experienced a notable expansion of urban centers and trade, driven by improvements in communication and a stable currency.  This led to the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and others, signifying a vibrant urban economy.  The vast majority of the population comprised peasants, who frequently faced challenges due to famines and wars, yet a more affluent segment of owner-cultivators existed, holding significant influence within village communities.  The period also saw advancements in various crafts and agricultural technologies.  The rahat (Persian wheel), used for irrigation, was improved, leading to increased agricultural productivity.  Paper-making and weaving techniques also saw significant advancements.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the economic and social realities of the Delhi Sultanate.


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, in his writings from the early 14th century, acknowledged the pre-existing use of regional languages for everyday purposes.
2.  The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit, partly due to the diminishing influence of Brahmans, contributed to the rise of regional languages.
3.  The Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages for religious expression played a significant role in their development and literary flourishing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of regional language development in medieval India.  Amir Khusrau's observations confirm the prior existence and practical usage of these languages. The diminishing prestige of Sanskrit, intertwined with the changing social dynamics involving the Brahmans, created space for vernaculars to gain prominence.  Crucially, the Bhakti movement actively employed regional languages to disseminate its message, fostering their literary growth and solidifying their status as vehicles for religious expression and wider cultural exchange.  This widespread adoption of regional languages for religious purposes is a key factor distinguishing this period in Indian history. The options that exclude any of these statements overlook the interconnected nature of these factors in shaping the linguistic landscape of medieval India.


**2. With reference to the impact of Persian culture on Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical instruments, including the rabab and sarangi, and new musical modes (ragas) like aiman, ghora, and sanam.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a significant figure, is credited with the invention of the sitar, although historical evidence remains inconclusive, and with introducing Perso-Arabic airs (ragas).
3.  The integration of Persian musical influences was primarily confined to the courts of the Delhi Sultanate and did not significantly impact regional musical traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the impact of Persian culture on Indian music. The introduction of new instruments and ragas from Perso-Arabic traditions is well-documented. Amir Khusrau's contributions, though debated regarding the sitar's invention, are undeniable in introducing Persian musical elements into the Indian musical landscape. However, statement 3 is inaccurate.  While the courts of the Delhi Sultanate were major centers for this cultural fusion, the influence of Persian music wasn't limited to these areas.  Regional musical traditions across India demonstrably incorporated these influences over time, resulting in a diverse yet interconnected musical evolution. The options that exclude either statement 1 or 2 fail to recognize the significant contributions of new instruments and ragas and the important role of Amir Khusrau in the process of integration.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, rejected the caste system, fasts, feasts, pilgrimages, and sacrifices.
2.  The Bhakti movement, while not explicitly opposing the caste system, promoted a path open to all castes, emphasizing love and devotion to God over rigid rituals.
3.  The Nath Panthi movement primarily focused on ascetic practices and did not significantly challenge the Brahmanical dominance or the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the key features of the Lingayat and Bhakti movements. The Lingayat movement's direct challenge to the caste system and its rejection of traditional Hindu practices are well-established. The Bhakti movement, while not actively dismantling the caste hierarchy, provided a path to spiritual liberation accessible to all regardless of caste, emphasizing devotion over ritualistic adherence. Statement 3, however, is misleading. While the Nath Panthis did emphasize ascetic practices, they also challenged the Brahmanical order and the rigidity of the caste system, thus making it incorrect. The options that don't include both statements 1 and 2 fail to capture the distinct yet related characteristics of these influential socio-religious movements and their impact on the social structure of medieval India.  The Bhakti movement's inclusive nature and the Lingayat's direct opposition to the caste system are key elements that distinguished these movements from other contemporary social and religious reform movements.


**4. With reference to the political and social changes in the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1.  The disintegration of the Timurid empire in Central Asia and the rise of the Uzbeks and Safavids created a power vacuum, prompting Babur's westward expansion.
2.  Babur's conquest of India was primarily driven by economic motives, as Kabul's limited resources incentivized him to seek the wealth of Hindustan.
3.  The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) marked the beginning of the widespread establishment of Turkish rule across the Gangetic plain and marked the end of the Rajput dominance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The political instability in Central Asia following the Timurid decline indeed influenced Babur's ambitions, and the limited resources of Kabul significantly contributed to his focus on India's wealth.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the battles of Tarain were pivotal in establishing the Turkish presence in North India, the process of establishing widespread Turkish rule across the Gangetic plain took considerably longer than just those two battles. The complete subjugation of Rajput powers also occurred gradually over an extended period, not immediately after Tarain. Options that don't include both statements 1 and 2 fail to recognize the multifaceted factors driving Babur's campaign and the broader geopolitical context.  The economic incentives and the power dynamics of Central Asia are crucial for understanding Babur's motivations and subsequent impact on Indian history.  It is important to note that the timeline of events as presented in statement 3 is inaccurate.


**5. With reference to the economic conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance internal trade led to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in North India, with some guilds eventually transforming into sub-castes.
2.  India's overseas trade with Southeast Asia and China flourished, with Indian merchants playing a crucial role, facilitated by the shipbuilding tradition of Malabar, Bengal, and Burma.
3.  Despite the wealth and prosperity of the ruling classes, the European accounts consistently highlight the widespread poverty among ordinary peasants, artisans, and laborers, characterized by inadequate clothing and limited access to resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict aspects of the medieval Indian economy. The decline of long-distance internal trade did impact the trade guilds, with some evolving into sub-castes, reflecting the economic shifts of the era.  Simultaneously, overseas trade with Southeast Asia and China flourished, showing a vibrant maritime tradition and the entrepreneurial spirit of Indian merchants. Lastly, the contrast between the opulence of the elite and the widespread poverty among the common people is well documented by European travelers, underscoring the significant economic inequalities of the time. The options that exclude any of these statements fail to recognize the complexity of the medieval Indian economy, characterized by both thriving international trade and persistent internal poverty. The coexistence of these seemingly contradictory aspects is a key feature of the economic history of medieval India.


**1. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates in the 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The treaty of 1636 between Shah Jahan and Bijapur resulted in Bijapur ceding territory worth approximately 80 lakh rupees annually to the Mughals.
2.  The Golconda Sultanate, under the treaty of 1636, agreed to include Shah Jahan's name in the khutba and remit its annual tribute to Bijapur.
3.  Following the 1636 treaties, Bijapur and Golconda significantly expanded their territories southward, conquering several petty principalities in Karnataka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty of 1636 resulted in Bijapur *receiving* territory worth about 80 lakh rupees annually (from Ahmadnagar), not ceding it to the Mughals.  The treaty aimed to bring Bijapur under Mughal suzerainty,  requiring tribute and non-interference in Golconda's affairs, but not territorial cession to the Mughals in return.  This highlights the complexities of Mughal diplomacy in the Deccan, balancing power plays and strategic alliances.

Statement 2 is correct. The treaty with Golconda stipulated the inclusion of Shah Jahan's name in the khutba (Friday sermon), a clear demonstration of Mughal dominance.  The remission of Golconda's tribute to Bijapur and the institution of a smaller tribute directly to the Mughal emperor further solidified Mughal authority in the region. This reflects the Mughal strategy of integrating regional powers through a combination of military pressure and diplomatic maneuvering.

Statement 3 is correct. The treaties of 1636 brought a period of relative peace, enabling Bijapur and Golconda to launch successful campaigns southwards. Their expansion into Karnataka, conquering numerous petty principalities, marked a high point in their power and prosperity. This underscores the fluctuating balance of power in the Deccan, where periods of Mughal dominance were interspersed with periods of regional expansion by the Deccan sultanates.  The subsequent internal conflicts within these expanded sultanates, however, ultimately undermined their long-term stability.



**2. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah II of Bijapur is known for composing the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a book of songs set to various ragas.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur is remembered for his patronage of Sanskrit scholars, including Waman Pandit.
3.  The Gol Gumbaz, a mausoleum in Bijapur, is renowned for its exceptionally large dome and remarkable acoustics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas, was composed by Ibrahim Adil Shah II, not Ali Adil Shah II. This underscores the diverse artistic patronage of the Deccan rulers, highlighting their appreciation of both Persian and Indian musical traditions. The blending of musical styles reflects the cultural synthesis within the Deccan sultanates.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ali Adil Shah I, not Ibrahim Adil Shah II, is known for his patronage of Sanskrit scholars, including Waman Pandit. This points to the early adoption of a policy of religious tolerance by some Deccan rulers,  preceding Akbar’s similar policies.  The appointment of Hindu scholars to prominent positions in the court demonstrates the pragmatic approach of some rulers in incorporating diverse talent into their administrations.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur is indeed famous for its massive dome and exceptional acoustics, a testament to the architectural achievements of the Bijapur Sultanate. The architectural style of the Gol Gumbaz, which incorporates both Persian and Indian elements, showcases the rich cultural heritage of the region. The impressive scale and engineering feats demonstrated in the construction of the Gol Gumbaz highlight the advanced technological capabilities of the period.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar abolished the jizya tax but retained the pilgrim tax on holy places like Prayag and Banaras.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established in Fatehpur Sikri, was initially restricted to Muslim theologians but later opened to representatives of other faiths.
3.  Akbar’s *Makzar* declaration asserted his right to choose among conflicting interpretations of the Quran, based on his authority as a just and wise king.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar abolished *both* the jizya tax and the pilgrim tax as part of his policy of religious tolerance.  The abolition of these taxes signaled a move towards greater religious equality and aimed to foster unity within his diverse empire.  This act contrasts with the policies of some of his successors who reinstated the jizya tax.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana initially focused on discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives from various faiths including Christians, Zoroastrians, Hindus, and Jains. This reflects Akbar's evolving approach to religious understanding and his desire to engage with different religious perspectives.  The inclusion of diverse religious viewpoints in the discussions demonstrates Akbar’s intellectual curiosity and his commitment to fostering religious harmony.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar’s *Makzar* declaration indeed asserted his right to choose among conflicting interpretations of the Quran, based on his perceived divinely-granted authority as a just and wise king.  This declaration, though controversial, highlights Akbar's attempts to reconcile religious differences and maintain social order within his empire.  The *Makzar* exemplifies Akbar's ambition to transcend traditional religious authority and exercise his own judgment in matters of religious interpretation.  The declaration’s impact on religious and political discourse in the Mughal empire remains a topic of scholarly debate.


**4. With reference to the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's Deccan policy primarily focused on subduing the Golconda Sultanate.
2.  The treaty with Golconda required Golconda to pay an annual tribute of four lakh *huns* to the Mughal emperor.
3. Shah Jahan's treaties with Bijapur and Golconda effectively realised Akbar's objective of establishing Mughal suzerainty across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Shah Jahan did deal with Golconda, his primary focus in the Deccan was Bijapur, recognising its pivotal role in the regional power dynamics.  The Mughal strategy in the Deccan involved a nuanced approach, focusing on key players to achieve overall control rather than a blanket campaign against all Deccan sultanates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The treaty with Golconda involved a reduction in its tribute payment, not an increase to four lakh *huns*.  Golconda was previously paying a tribute to Bijapur; after the treaty, this was replaced with a smaller tribute to the Mughal emperor. This shows Shah Jahan's diplomatic skill in integrating regional powers while reducing the overall burden of tribute.

Statement 3 is correct.  Through his strategic alliances and treaties with Bijapur and Golconda, Shah Jahan successfully established Mughal suzerainty over a significant part of the Indian subcontinent, fulfilling a key objective of Akbar's reign.  This achievement reflects the continuity and evolution of Mughal imperial policy over generations, demonstrating the long-term vision of establishing a unified empire. The relative peace that followed enabled the Deccan states to expand southwards, temporarily shifting the focus of conflict away from the Mughals.


**5. With reference to the political and administrative developments in India during the first half of the 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jahangir and Shah Jahan maintained close alliances with the Rajputs, completely neglecting other powerful groups.
2.  The Mughal administrative system under Jahangir and Shah Jahan remained largely unchanged from the system developed under Akbar.
3.  The Mughal Empire during this period played a significant role in stabilizing India’s relations with neighbouring Asian powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jahangir and Shah Jahan continued to maintain alliances with the Rajputs, they also sought to broaden the empire's political base by engaging with other powerful groups like the Afghans and Marathas.  This illustrates the pragmatic approach of the Mughal emperors in building a wide-ranging coalition of support.  The inclusion of diverse groups in the imperial structure helped to enhance stability and prevent the concentration of power in a single ethnic or regional group.

Statement 2 is correct. Jahangir and Shah Jahan largely maintained and consolidated the administrative system established by Akbar.  This reflects the stability and effectiveness of Akbar’s administrative reforms, which continued to provide a strong foundation for the Mughal Empire.  The continuity in administration ensured efficient governance across the vast empire, facilitating both economic development and the collection of revenue.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mughal emperors of this period actively engaged in diplomatic relations with neighboring Asian powers such as Iran, the Uzbeks, and the Ottoman Turks.  This reflects the Mughal Empire's role in the broader geopolitical landscape of Asia and its understanding of the importance of international relations to maintain peace and facilitate trade. The diplomatic efforts helped to maintain regional stability and secure trade routes, crucial for the economic prosperity of the empire.


**6.  With reference to the Bengali language and literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) is widely considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language.
2.  Rupa and Sanatan, two brothers celebrated as pious Vaishnavas, held high administrative positions under Alauddin Hussain Shah.
3.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's policy of offering high offices to Hindus extended to appointing a Hindu as his chief military commander.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is indeed considered a crucial period for the development of Bengali literature.  The patronage extended to Bengali writers during this period contributed significantly to the growth and enrichment of the language.  This highlights the influence of royal patronage on the development of regional languages and literatures during the medieval period.

Statement 2 is correct. Rupa and Sanatan, two brothers known for their Vaishnava faith, held important positions in Alauddin Hussain Shah's court, one serving as the sultan's private secretary.  This demonstrates the inclusion of Hindus in important administrative roles, reflecting a policy of religious tolerance.  The appointment of Hindus to high offices underlines the sultan’s pragmatic approach to governance and his willingness to draw upon the talents of his diverse subjects.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah appointed Hindus to various high offices, including his wazir (chief minister), chief physician, and master of the mint, the text doesn't mention a Hindu chief military commander. This points to the selective nature of religious tolerance, with certain positions possibly remaining within the control of the Muslim elite. The omission of a Hindu military leader suggests a potential limitation in the extent of religious inclusivity in the military establishment.


**7. With reference to the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Sindh opened up trade routes along the Indus River for Punjab.
2.  Akbar's campaign in the Khyber Pass resulted in the death of Raja Birbal.
3.  Akbar's policy towards the Uzbeks primarily involved military conquest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's conquest of Sindh did indeed open trade routes along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab.  This expansion demonstrates Akbar's awareness of the importance of trade for economic prosperity and his strategy of extending Mughal influence through both military conquest and economic integration. The control of trade routes enhanced the empire's wealth and strengthened its connections with different regions of India.

Statement 2 is correct. Raja Birbal, a close confidant of Akbar, did indeed lose his life during a campaign in the Khyber Pass.  This highlights the risks involved in maintaining the northwestern frontier and the personal cost of imperial expansion. Birbal's death underscored the challenges faced by the Mughal Empire in securing its borders against rebellious tribes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Akbar did employ military force, his policy towards the Uzbeks also involved diplomacy and negotiation.  This points to Akbar's pragmatic approach to foreign policy, which combined military strength with diplomatic initiatives.  Akbar’s strategy of combining military pressure with diplomacy demonstrates his understanding of the need to balance power and maintain regional stability.  The ultimate goal was not necessarily military conquest but the establishment of a secure and defensible frontier.

3.  Sikandar Lodi selected the site for the city of Agra while campaigning in eastern Rajasthan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that Sikandar Lodi *reimposed* the jizya tax, implying that it had been previously abolished, and executed a Brahman for a specific religious opinion. However, his reign also saw significant cultural exchanges between Hindus and Muslims.

Statement 2 is correct. Sikandar Lodi's patronage of scholarship led to the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian, fostering cultural interaction. This reflects a policy aimed at bridging the cultural gap between the two communities, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to governance that sought to integrate diverse elements of society.  The translations facilitated the exchange of knowledge and ideas, showcasing the cultural synthesis of the time.

Statement 3 is correct. Sikandar Lodi did indeed select the site for Agra while on campaign in eastern Rajasthan.  The establishment of Agra as a major city reflects a strategic decision aimed at consolidating the empire's control over a critical region and securing important trade routes.  The choice of location for Agra underlines the importance of military strategy and economic considerations in the development of urban centers during the medieval period.

1.  Zainul Abidin's reign saw the widespread persecution of Brahmans and the destruction of Hindu temples.
2.  Zainul Abidin abolished the jizya and cow slaughter.
3.  Under Zainul Abidin, many Sanskrit works, including Kalhana's *Rajatarangini*, were translated into Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Zainul Abidin's reign was marked by religious tolerance and the restoration of Hindu temples and properties after a period of persecution under his predecessor.  His policies aimed at reconciliation and the integration of different religious communities within the kingdom.  This reversal of policies highlights the significant role of individual rulers in shaping religious policies and social harmony.

Statement 2 is correct.  Zainul Abidin did indeed abolish the jizya tax and cow slaughter, demonstrating his commitment to religious harmony.  These actions reflect a pragmatic approach to governance that sought to appease the Hindu population and foster a sense of unity within the kingdom.  The abolition of these taxes demonstrates a conscious effort to improve relations between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir.

Statement 3 is correct.  Many Sanskrit works, including Kalhana's *Rajatarangini*, were translated into Persian under Zainul Abidin's patronage.  This reflects the promotion of cultural exchange and the integration of different cultural traditions.  The translations facilitated access to knowledge and literature from different cultures, reflecting a broader trend of cultural synthesis during the medieval period.


**10. With reference to the early stages of the Turkish conquest of North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghaznavid conquest of the Punjab and Multan created a direct military threat to the Gangetic heartland.
2.  The Rajput rulers effectively thwarted the Ghaznavid expansion into the Gangetic plains.
3.  The rise of the Seljuk Empire significantly weakened the Ghaznavids, limiting their ability to further conquer India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ghaznavid conquest of the Punjab and Multan indeed established a foothold for further incursions into the Gangetic plains.  This expansion marked a significant turning point in Indian history, opening the way for subsequent Turkish conquests.  The loss of these strategically important regions weakened the defenses of the Gangetic heartland and made it more vulnerable to future invasions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajput rulers offered spirited resistance and inflicted several defeats on the Ghaznavids, they ultimately failed to prevent the Turkish expansion into the Gangetic plains. This demonstrates the limitations of fragmented resistance against a centralized invading force and highlights the strategic importance of the Punjab and Multan as gateways to India's heartland. The inability of the Rajput states to coordinate their defense effectively allowed the Turks to gradually expand their control.

Statement 3 is correct. The rise of the Seljuk Empire did severely weaken the Ghaznavids, confining their power to Ghazni and the Punjab. This shift in the Central Asian power balance resulted in a reduction in the scale and frequency of Ghaznavid raids into India. The decline of the Ghaznavids created a power vacuum that allowed other regional powers in India to emerge, and it also paved the way for the Ghurid conquests.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya I's military campaigns primarily focused on reclaiming territories lost to the Bahmani Sultans south of the Krishna River, resulting in a stalemate.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's naval power was strong enough to extract regular tribute from distant Southeast Asian kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim.
3.  Travel accounts from Nicolo Conti, Abdur Razzaq, and Nuniz consistently portray Vijayanagara as a vast, wealthy, and densely populated empire with a large army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Deva Raya I's attempts to regain Mudkal, Bankapur, and other territories south of the Krishna River, previously lost to the Bahmani Sultans, culminated in three battles ending in a return to the existing borders, reflecting the limitations of his military power in that specific context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did have naval capabilities, evidenced by its interactions with Sri Lanka, the extent of its influence over distant Southeast Asian kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim is questionable.  Nuniz's account mentions tribute, but this might have been symbolic or infrequent, rather than regular extraction of tribute, implying a less dominant naval presence than the statement suggests.  The statement overstates the reach of Vijayanagara's naval power.

Statement 3 is correct.  Multiple foreign accounts from Nicolo Conti, Abdur Razzaq, and Nuniz concur in describing Vijayanagara as a large, prosperous, and populous empire with a substantial military force. Their descriptions, though varying in detail, consistently highlight the empire's size, wealth, and military strength.  These accounts provide corroborating evidence for the empire's scale and power.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a significant increase in Hindu participation in the Deccan's administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2. Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership marked the peak of the Bahmani Kingdom's territorial expansion, including significant gains on the western coast.
3. The Bahmani Kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five independent sultanates, with Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda becoming major players in Deccan politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Firuz Shah Bahmani implemented a policy of including Hindus, especially Deccan Brahmins, in administrative roles, notably in revenue administration. This marked a shift in the Bahmani kingdom's administrative structure, demonstrating a degree of religious tolerance and pragmatism.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister saw the Bahmani Kingdom reach its zenith in terms of territorial control.  His military campaigns resulted in expansions in the east and, crucially, the capture of key western coastal ports like Dabhol and Goa, significantly impacting Vijayanagara's trade.

Statement 3 is correct. The decline and eventual collapse of the Bahmani Kingdom led to the formation of five successor states: Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar. Among these, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda emerged as dominant powers in Deccan politics, shaping the region's political landscape for a considerable period.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara and Bahmani conflict, consider the following statements:**

1. The conflict between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultanate primarily revolved around religious differences and the imposition of Jizya tax.
2.  The Krishna-Godavari basin was a major area of contention between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultanate throughout their conflict.
3.  The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) decisively ended the Vijayanagara Empire's dominance in South India, although the kingdom itself survived for a century afterward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While religious differences existed, the primary drivers of the Vijayanagara-Bahmani conflict were political and strategic considerations, especially control over vital trade routes and territories like the Krishna-Godavari basin.  The imposition of Jizya tax, while a factor in some conflicts, doesn't represent the core issue in the overall conflict.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Krishna-Godavari basin was a crucial region of contention between the two empires.  Control of this fertile and strategically important area was a recurring theme throughout their prolonged conflict, reflecting its economic and political significance.

Statement 3 is correct. The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565, while not immediately resulting in the kingdom's total collapse, significantly weakened the Vijayanagara Empire, marking the end of its period of dominance.  The empire continued to exist for another century, but its power and territorial extent were drastically reduced, significantly altering the political balance in South India.  The statement correctly identifies the battle's long-term impact.


**4. With reference to the economic policies of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's economic policies focused primarily on improving agricultural productivity through extensive canal construction and land reforms.
2.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq's system of procuring slaves involved selecting handsome young boys from conquered territories and training them in various crafts.
3.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq's humanitarian measures, such as establishing hospitals and providing dowries, were primarily aimed at benefiting the Muslim population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Firuz Shah Tughlaq implemented significant public works projects, including the construction of numerous canals for irrigation, which aimed to enhance agricultural production and the economy.  These works reflect a focus on improving agricultural productivity, a key aspect of his economic policies.

Statement 2 is correct. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's policy of acquiring slaves from conquered territories involved selecting attractive young boys, training them in various crafts, and employing them in royal workshops, highlighting a unique aspect of his administration. This reveals a system of slave acquisition and utilization that was both economic and political in nature.

Statement 3 is correct. While Firuz Shah Tughlaq's humanitarian measures, such as establishing hospitals and providing dowries, benefited the general population, the primary beneficiaries were likely Muslims from good families who had fallen on hard times.  This indicates a focus on maintaining social order and supporting a specific segment of the population within his broader humanitarian agenda.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's military campaigns led to the complete conquest of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms, consolidating Chola dominance in South India.
2. The Chola navy played a crucial role in Rajaraja I and Rajendra I's conquests, facilitating their expansion into Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.
3. Rajendra I's reign witnessed the annexation of the Ganga kingdom in Karnataka and further expansion into the Pandya and Chera territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I significantly weakened the Pandya and Chera kingdoms through military campaigns, he did not achieve their complete conquest.  His actions brought them under Chola influence and control, but the kingdoms retained some degree of autonomy. The statement overstates the extent of Rajaraja I's conquests.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chola navy was instrumental in the empire's expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Their naval power facilitated campaigns against Sri Lanka and enabled them to project power into Southeast Asia, highlighting the navy's significant role in the empire's success.

Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra I continued his father's expansionist policies, completing the conquest of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms.  He also extended Chola power by annexing parts of the Ganga kingdom in Karnataka, demonstrating a continuation of aggressive expansion.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the social and economic life in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The prevalence of vegetarianism was absolute across all sections of the population in medieval India.
2.  Arab writers uniformly praised the complete absence of intoxicants in medieval Indian society.
3.  Pastimes like animal fights, wrestling, and dicing were popular among various social classes in medieval India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While vegetarianism was prevalent in many areas and among certain sections of the population, the text explicitly mentions that the consumption of meat, including peacock, horse, wild ass, wild cock, and wild pig, was considered lawful on specific occasions according to leading smriti writers of the time. This indicates that vegetarianism was not a universal practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Arab writers did compliment the Indians for the limited use of intoxicants, but the text acknowledges this as an idealized picture.  Literary works of the period frequently mention wine-drinking on ceremonial occasions, marriages, feasts, and outings.  This shows that the complete absence of intoxicants was not accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that various pastimes, including animal fights (rams, cocks), wrestling bouts, and dicing (among the upper classes), were popular.  This demonstrates the diverse range of entertainment and leisure activities prevalent in medieval Indian society across different social strata.  The statement accurately reflects this aspect of social life.


**2. With reference to education and religious learning in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The system of education in medieval India was characterized by widespread mass education initiatives.
2.  Temples sometimes provided higher-level education, and students often lived with teachers, paying fees or offering services.
3.  The Kayasthas primarily focused on religious education, neglecting secular subjects like administration and accountancy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there was no concept of mass education during this period.  Learning was largely confined to a small section of the population, primarily Brahmins and some upper-class sections.  This contradicts the statement's assertion of widespread mass education.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage details how temples sometimes provided higher-level education, and students often resided with their teachers, providing services or fees in return for instruction.  This accurately describes a key aspect of the educational system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text highlights that the Kayasthas had their own system of teaching focused on administration and accountancy, indicating a focus on secular subjects rather than solely religious instruction.  This directly refutes the statement's claim.


**3. With reference to the decline of Indian science in the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of Indian science was solely due to the internal developments within the scientific community.
2.  The practice of surgery declined because the dissection of dead bodies was considered taboo across all castes.
3.  Al-Biruni, despite admiring Indian science, noted the insular attitude of learned Brahmins, hindering scientific exchange.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text attributes the stagnation of Indian science to multiple factors, including the increasing rigidity and narrowness of society, a setback in urban life and communication, growing religious orthodoxy, and a tendency to isolate themselves from external scientific thought.  It wasn't solely an internal issue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the dissection of dead bodies was considered fit only for low castes, leading to the decline of surgery, it does not say that this was a universal taboo across all castes.  The statement oversimplifies a complex social factor.

Statement 3 is correct. The text directly quotes Al-Biruni's observations on the insular attitude of learned Brahmins, their reluctance to share knowledge with others (especially foreigners), and their belief that only they possessed scientific knowledge.  This accurately reflects Al-Biruni's assessment and a contributing factor to the decline of scientific exchange.


**4. With reference to religious movements and beliefs in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of Buddhism and Jainism was solely due to intellectual challenges to their tenets.
2.  The Pandya king's execution of Jain monks at the instance of a Saivite preacher demonstrates widespread persecution.
3.  The Nath-Panthis, followers of Gorakhnath, upheld the caste system and Brahmanical privileges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions both intellectual challenges and instances of persecution of Buddhist and Jain monks as factors in their decline.  The statement omits the significant role of persecution.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Pandya king's execution of Jain monks, indicating religious persecution, even if not widespread in the sense of encompassing the entire country.  The statement accurately reflects this event.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Nath-Panthis, associated with Gorakhnath, are described in the text as denouncing the caste system and the privileges claimed by Brahmins.  This directly contradicts the statement's claim.



**5. With reference to the political and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan of Navadwipa advocated for the abolition of Brahmanical privileges.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi strongly supported Akbar's liberal religious policies.
3.  The struggle between entrenched privilege and egalitarian aspirations was a recurring theme in Indian history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text portrays Raghunandan as asserting Brahmanical privileges, stating that only Brahmins had the right to read scriptures or preach.  This is the opposite of the statement's claim.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi is described as opposing Akbar's liberal policies and the concept of pantheistic mysticism, advocating for a stricter, more orthodox interpretation of Islam.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly identifies the recurring conflict between entrenched privilege and power, on one hand, and the egalitarian and humanistic aspirations of the masses, on the other, as a significant aspect of Indian history.  The statement accurately reflects this recurring dynamic.


**6. With reference to the economic life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the 'rahat' (Persian wheel) significantly improved irrigation techniques during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed the introduction of entirely new crafts and techniques, with no pre-existing Indian counterparts.
3. The royal karkhanas (workshops) produced only articles for the sultan's personal use, neglecting the needs of the nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the improvement of the rahat (Persian wheel) for irrigation as a key development during this period. This enhanced agricultural practices and contributed to economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the introduction or popularization of several new crafts and techniques by the Turks, it also notes that not all of them were entirely new, implying that some had pre-existing Indian counterparts which were improved upon.  The statement presents an inaccurate portrayal of the situation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the royal karkhanas catered to all the needs of the sultan, including the manufacturing of costly articles for the nobility. The workshops provided goods and services for both the sultan and the elite class.


**7. With reference to the social structure during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The term 'Samanta' exclusively referred to government officers who received revenue-bearing villages as payment.
2. The position of the peasant was independent and not dependent on the ruling class.
3. The 'Rajput' identity was formed solely through hereditary lineage, with no social mobility possible.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explains that 'Samanta' encompassed various groups, including government officers, defeated rulers, local chiefs, and tribal leaders.  The statement presents an overly narrow definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the peasant's position was a dependent one, subject to various taxes, forced labour, and the power of local chiefs. This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text discusses the complex process of 'Rajputization,' where people from different social groups gained Rajput status through a combination of factors including political power and economic prosperity. The statement wrongly asserts a rigid, unchanging social structure.


**8. With reference to the religious policies of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's policy regarding temples strictly adhered to the letter of the Sharia, without any deviation.
2. The re-imposition of jizya was primarily intended as a measure to boost the Mughal empire's financial stability.
3.  The destruction of temples under Aurangzeb was solely motivated by religious zeal, without any political considerations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that while Aurangzeb's policy regarding temples formally aligned with the Sharia, its implementation varied based on local officials' interpretations and the political context. The destruction of temples during times of war, for example, suggests a deviation from strict adherence to religious law alone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text argues that while the income from jizya was considerable, it was not the primary motive for its re-imposition.  Aurangzeb's decision was driven more by political and ideological goals of rallying the Muslim population and asserting the superiority of Islam.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly links the destruction of temples to both religious and political motives, including punishment for opposition and suppression of subversive ideas among Hindus.  The statement overlooks the significant political dimension.


**9. With reference to the cultural development during the period 1300-1500 in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Turkish invaders who came to India were entirely devoid of any cultural sophistication or refinement.
2. The process of cultural assimilation between the Turks and Indians was seamless and devoid of any conflict or resistance.
3. The development of a new enriched culture was a rapid process with immediate and widespread effects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes this, stating that the Turkish invaders were not "rude barbarians" but had already absorbed aspects of Arabo-Persian culture.  This contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text highlights that the interaction between the Turks and Indians was a long process involving both destruction and construction, with mutual misunderstanding and strife.  The statement ignores the conflictual aspects of the process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text emphasizes that the development of a new culture was a long and gradual process, with many ups and downs, varying across regions and time periods. The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate timeline.


**10. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market regulations were primarily aimed at controlling inflation and ensuring fair prices for the common people.
2. The market reforms introduced during Alauddin Khalji’s reign led to an immediate and drastic decline in the prices of essential commodities.
3. Alauddin Khalji’s agrarian reforms focused solely on increasing revenue collection, neglecting the welfare of the peasantry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions that Alauddin Khalji's market regulations were aimed at controlling inflation and ensuring fair prices. This was a key objective of his economic policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the market reforms aimed at price control, the text doesn't suggest an immediate and drastic decline in prices. The success of the reforms was not absolute nor immediate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text doesn't explicitly state that Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms neglected the welfare of the peasantry.  While increasing revenue was a goal, the reforms also aimed at establishing a closer relationship with rural areas, implying some concern for the peasantry's well-being.  The statement is an oversimplification.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Kalinga and Bengal led to him adopting the title "Gangaikondachola."
2. The Chola navy's dominance extended to the Bay of Bengal, earning it the moniker "Chola Lake."
3.  The Brihadeeswarar Temple in Tanjore was constructed during the reign of Rajendra I and served as a repository of Chola victories through its inscriptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra I's successful campaign across Kalinga to Bengal, culminating in the defeat of local kings and crossing the Ganga river, indeed resulted in him adopting the title "Gangaikondachola," signifying his conquest of the Ganga region.  This expansion significantly bolstered the Chola empire's power and prestige.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chola navy was a formidable force, controlling a significant portion of the Bay of Bengal. Its strength and dominance led to the Bay of Bengal being referred to as a "Chola Lake," highlighting their naval supremacy in the region. This naval power facilitated their extensive trade and overseas expeditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Tanjore is a significant Chola monument, completed in 1010, it was constructed during the reign of Rajaraja I, not Rajendra I.  Rajendra I, however, continued the practice of using temple inscriptions to chronicle his victories, demonstrating a continuation of the established Chola tradition.  The confusion between the two rulers, both major figures in Chola history, makes this a strong distractor.


**2. With reference to the Chola administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The basic administrative unit in the Chola Empire was the "Valanadu," comprising several "Nadus."
2.  The Chola system featured a strong emphasis on local self-government, particularly evident in the functioning of village assemblies like the "Ur" and "Sabha/Mahasabha."
3. The Chola kings directly administered all territories within their empire, leaving no scope for local autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The "Zadu" was the basic administrative unit in the Chola Empire, not the "Valanadu."  Nadus were larger groupings of several villages, and Valanadus were further groupings of Nadus. This subtle difference in terminology is a key element to test detailed knowledge of Chola administration.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chola Empire is renowned for its sophisticated system of local self-government. Village assemblies, such as the "Ur" (a general assembly) and the "Sabha/Mahasabha" (assemblies predominantly in Brahman villages), played a significant role in managing local affairs, showcasing a decentralized approach to governance. This contrasts sharply with the centralized systems of some other empires.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola administration was a mix of centralized control and decentralized local administration. While the king held ultimate authority, the Chola rulers delegated significant powers to local bodies, allowing for a considerable degree of autonomy at the village level. This demonstrates a nuanced approach to governance that was effective in managing a large and diverse empire.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya II's reign saw tributes paid by kings of Quilon, Sri Lanka, and Burma, indicating Vijayanagara's naval dominance.
2. The Italian traveler Nicolo Conti's account describes Vijayanagara as a city with a circumference of sixty miles, boasting ninety thousand armed men.
3.  Abdur Razzaq's description highlights Vijayanagara's seven citadels and walls, emphasizing its extensive fortifications and vast size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While Deva Raya II's reign did see contact with kingdoms like Quilon and Sri Lanka, the extent of their "tribute" is debated.  The claim of regular tribute from Burma (Tenasserim) is questionable; it's more likely that these were diplomatic gifts or trade-related exchanges.  The question uses the word "tribute" to create ambiguity and test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of historical accounts.

Statement 2 is correct. Nicolo Conti's account provides a vivid description of Vijayanagara's size and military strength, mentioning its vast circumference and the significant number of armed men. This account offers a valuable glimpse into the empire's scale and power from a foreign perspective.

Statement 3 is correct. Abdur Razzaq's detailed account accurately describes Vijayanagara's impressive fortifications, highlighting the multiple layers of citadels and walls that protected the city. This description underscores the city's strategic importance and advanced defensive capabilities.  The use of specific numbers (seven citadels) adds to the detail and makes it a more challenging statement to verify.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti Movement, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir, despite his humble origins as a weaver, is widely recognized for his profound philosophical contributions to the Bhakti movement.  His emphasis on the unity of God, transcending religious boundaries, and his critique of traditional Hindu practices like idol worship and pilgrimages, made him a highly influential figure.

Statement 3 is correct. Namadeva, known for his background as a tailor, is celebrated for his moving Marathi poetry that conveys intense love and devotion to God.  His interactions with Sufi saints in Delhi further highlight the cross-cultural exchange and synthesis of ideas during that era.  The inclusion of specific details, such as his profession and location of interaction with Sufi saints, makes this a more demanding statement.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history, religion, and society.

**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and rituals, emphasizing detachment from worldly affairs.
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava, vehemently opposed the caste system and advocated for social reform.
3.  The Nathpanthis, a group of yogis, primarily comprised of upper-caste individuals and upheld the existing social hierarchy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, in contrast to its portrayal in the statement, actively rejected austere practices and instead emphasized a loving and personal relationship with God, making it accessible to all castes.  The movement's emphasis on devotion and emotional connection challenged the rigid rituals and hierarchical structure of traditional Hinduism.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Lingayat (or Virashaiva) movement, founded by Basava, was a significant socio-religious reform movement in medieval Karnataka. It directly challenged the caste system, advocating for social equality and rejecting traditional Hindu practices like pilgrimages and sacrifices.  This focus on social justice and reform is a key aspect of the movement's legacy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Nathpanthis, followers of Gorakhnath, were a group of yogis who actively denounced the caste system and the privileges of Brahmins.  Their Tantric path was open to all, regardless of caste, directly contradicting the statement’s assertion.  Their membership included many from lower castes, highlighting their egalitarian approach.


**2. With reference to the economic and social life during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade in North India led to the strengthening of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) and their continued economic influence.
2.  The Dharmashastras of the period strictly enforced a complete ban on overseas travel for all social groups, leading to a decline in India's maritime trade.
3.  The Manigraman and Nandesi were prominent guilds involved in extensive overseas trade, particularly with Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The decline of long-distance trade in North India actually weakened the trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs), as their economic basis eroded.  The reduced volume of inter-regional trade diminished the guilds' importance and led to their gradual decline or transformation into sub-castes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some Dharmashastras discouraged travel beyond India, particularly overseas journeys, this ban was not strictly enforced.  Indian merchants, scholars, and craftsmen continued to engage in extensive overseas trade, demonstrating that the ban did not halt India’s maritime activities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds played a crucial role in India's overseas trade, especially with Southeast Asia. They were well-organized, engaged in both wholesale and retail trade, and demonstrated significant commercial enterprise and influence in international markets.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's revenue system, as detailed in Ain-i-Akbari, relied heavily on the existing Mughal Iqta system, with minimal changes.
2.  The Mansabdari system under Akbar primarily recruited nobles from Rajput and Afghan communities, excluding other groups.
3.  The Jharoka Darshan, a daily ritual of Akbar, was primarily intended to strengthen his relationship with the elite and high-ranking officials.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's revenue system, while building upon existing practices, introduced significant reforms and innovations, moving away from the purely Iqta-based system towards a more centralized and efficient structure. The Ain-i-Akbari details this complex system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajputs and Afghans were significant components of Akbar's Mansabdari system, it also included nobles from diverse backgrounds, including Indian Muslims, and even some individuals from humble origins who rose through merit.  The system aimed for a more inclusive approach to recruitment, though elite backgrounds remained influential.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Jharoka Darshan, while certainly interacting with elites, was primarily intended to maintain direct contact with the common people, allowing them to petition the emperor directly and fostering a sense of accessibility and connection between the ruler and his subjects.


**4. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revival of Hinduism during the medieval period involved the complete suppression of all other religious traditions, notably Buddhism and Jainism.
2.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism, contributing to the decline of these traditions.
3.  The Sufi movement primarily focused on promoting strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy and opposed any form of syncretism with other religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revival of Hinduism in the medieval period did not involve the complete suppression of Buddhism and Jainism. While these traditions experienced a decline in influence, they coexisted with Hinduism, albeit with diminished reach. Certain aspects of these traditions even influenced the evolving forms of Hinduism.

Statement 2 is correct. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta offered a powerful philosophical counterpoint to Buddhism and Jainism. His reinterpretation of Hindu philosophy provided a strong intellectual framework that contributed to the shift in religious dominance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sufi movement, while encompassing diverse interpretations, often promoted inclusivity and syncretism, embracing elements from other religious and cultural traditions. This approach contrasted sharply with the strict orthodoxy promoted by certain other Islamic groups.  Sufi practices often integrated local traditions, demonstrating a willingness to engage in interfaith dialogue and understanding.


**5. With reference to the political developments in North India during the 12th and 13th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of North India was primarily driven by economic motives, seeking control over the region's lucrative trade routes.
2. The Battle of Tarain (1192) decisively ended the rule of the Chauhans in Delhi and paved the way for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
3. The Gahadavala kingdom of Kannauj posed a significant military challenge to the Ghurids, resulting in prolonged conflicts before their eventual defeat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While control of trade routes was a factor, the Ghurid conquest of North India was primarily driven by political ambitions and expansionist goals. The desire to establish a powerful empire across a wider region was a key motivation.

Statement 2 is correct. The second Battle of Tarain (1192) marked a turning point, leading to the decline of the Chauhan power in Delhi and setting the stage for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate under the Ghurids. This battle had significant ramifications for the political landscape of North India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gahadavala kingdom of Kannauj proved to be a formidable opponent to the Ghurids, and their defeat at Chandawar after a significant military confrontation was crucial to establishing Ghurid control over the Gangetic plain.


These questions demand detailed knowledge of various aspects of medieval Indian history, going beyond surface-level understanding. They require the candidate to analyze statements, identify inaccuracies, and apply their knowledge to reach the correct conclusion.  The distractors are carefully crafted to test the candidate's true understanding and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, writing in the early fourteenth century, observed that regional languages were already established and used for everyday purposes.
2.  The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit, coupled with the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints, significantly contributed to the rise of regional languages.
3. The Vijayanagara rulers patronized Telugu literature, while Marathi served as an administrative language in the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of regional language development in medieval India. Amir Khusrau's observation highlights the pre-existing presence of these languages, contradicting the notion that they emerged solely during the medieval period. The decline of Sanskrit's prestige and the Bhakti movement's embrace of vernaculars were crucial factors in their rise.  The examples of Telugu in Vijayanagara and Marathi in the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms illustrate the patronage and administrative roles these languages played, showcasing their growing importance. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete because they fail to acknowledge the significant contributions of all three factors mentioned.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the socio-linguistic dynamics of medieval India.


**2. With reference to the integration of musical traditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed the systematic introduction of Perso-Arabic musical airs (ragas) and instruments like the rabab and sarangi.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a renowned musician, is credited with inventing the sitar, though evidence remains inconclusive.
3. Raja Man Singh of Gwalior oversaw the compilation of "Mari Kautuhal," a work documenting the new musical modes introduced by the Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. The Delhi Sultanate period indeed saw a significant influx of Perso-Arabic musical elements, enriching the existing Indian musical landscape.  Raja Man Singh's patronage of "Mari Kautuhal" demonstrates the documentation and preservation of this evolving musical fusion. However, statement 2 is debatable. While Amir Khusrau's contribution to music is undeniable, the claim of his invention of the sitar lacks definitive historical evidence. Attributing inventions to specific individuals without strong evidence is a common historical pitfall, and this statement serves as a good distractor.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to critically evaluate historical claims based on the available evidence.


**3. With reference to the cultural exchange between Hindu and Muslim traditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nusrat Shah of Bengal patronized the translation of the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata into Bengali.
2.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi's "Padmavat," written in Hindi, used the story of Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor as an allegory for Sufi concepts.
3.  Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, a Mughal noble, blended Bhakti poetry with Persian ideas in his work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect instances of cultural synthesis during the medieval period. Nusrat Shah's patronage of translations demonstrates the active engagement with Hindu epics within a Muslim court. Jaisi's "Padmavat" exemplifies the fusion of Sufi and Hindu themes within a single literary work, highlighting the permeability of religious and cultural boundaries.  Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan's work further underscores this intermingling of Bhakti and Persian literary traditions.  The options (a), (b), and (d) present incomplete and potentially misleading information, testing the candidate's ability to identify and synthesize multiple instances of cultural exchange. The question tests factual recall and an understanding of the complex interplay of religious and literary traditions in medieval India.



**4. With reference to the religious and intellectual climate of 15th-16th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kabir, a weaver by trade, emphasized the unity of God, rejecting idol worship and formal religious practices.
2.  Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism, advocated a monotheistic faith that transcended caste and creed but emphasized the importance of a guru for guidance.
3.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, preached Bhakti to all four varnas, disregarding traditional caste restrictions on social interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately portray key figures and their teachings within the religious and intellectual landscape of 15th-16th century India. Kabir's emphasis on monotheism and rejection of ritualistic practices are well-documented.  Guru Nanak's teachings, forming the foundation of Sikhism, similarly emphasized monotheism and the transcendence of caste, while also stressing the role of a guru. Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, extending its message to all varnas, further illustrates the broader trend of challenging traditional caste hierarchies.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to recognize the significant contributions and shared themes of all three religious figures in promoting a more inclusive and egalitarian religious outlook. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Bhakti movement's impact on religious thought and social dynamics.



**5. With reference to the Mughal architectural style, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram represents the culmination of pre-Mughal architecture and a transition towards the Mughal style.
2.  Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri incorporated architectural elements from Gujarat and Bengal, alongside Persian and Central Asian influences.
3.  The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan, exemplifies the pietra dura technique of decoration, combining Mughal architectural forms with formal garden design.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of Mughal architecture. Sher Shah's mausoleum marks a significant architectural milestone, bridging pre-Mughal and Mughal styles.  Fatehpur Sikri's eclectic design highlights the fusion of various regional and foreign influences that shaped Mughal aesthetics. The Taj Mahal, a pinnacle of Mughal architecture, showcases the pietra dura technique and the harmonious integration of architectural elements with landscape design.  The other options are incomplete, overlooking the significance of at least one of the architectural examples mentioned.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the evolution and characteristics of the Mughal architectural style.



**6. With reference to the literary and cultural contributions of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl, a prominent scholar and historian during Akbar's reign, established a style of prose writing that influenced subsequent generations.
2.  The Mughal court, under Akbar's patronage, became a significant center for Persian literature, attracting many poets and scholars from Iran.
3.  The use of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi flourished, with significant contributions from both Hindu and Muslim writers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the literary and cultural developments of the Mughal period. Abul Fazl's influence on prose writing is undeniable, establishing a style that endured for centuries.  Akbar's court actively fostered Persian literature, attracting scholars and poets from across the Islamic world. The flourishing of regional languages, with contributions from both Hindu and Muslim writers, represents a significant cultural shift and demonstrates the growing importance of vernacular literatures. The other options are incorrect because they fail to capture the full extent of the literary and cultural achievements of the period.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the multifaceted literary landscape of medieval India.


**7. With reference to the political and religious conflicts during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily peasant revolts with agrarian and economic grievances as their root causes.
2.  The Satnami rebellion, involving mostly peasants and low-caste people, challenged caste distinctions and religious boundaries.
3.  The Afghan uprisings, often tribal in nature, also reflected aspirations for regional independence, with religious factors playing a secondary role.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the nature of the conflicts that Aurangzeb faced. The Jat uprisings were fundamentally agrarian revolts stemming from economic grievances, although religious and political factors were also present. The Satnami rebellion is notable for its challenge to both caste and religious divisions, highlighting the complex interplay of social and religious factors. The Afghan uprisings, while often tribal in nature, also contained a strong desire for regional autonomy, with religious elements playing a less prominent but still present role. The other options are incomplete, failing to fully capture the multifaceted nature of these rebellions. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills in understanding the complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors in shaping these rebellions.


**8. With reference to the religious and social reform movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nath Panthi movement challenged the caste system and the Brahmanical order's authority.
2.  The Bhakti movement in South India, led by Nayanmars and Alvars, emphasized a personal and loving relationship with God, transcending caste barriers.
3.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, while emphasizing the unity of God and the world, primarily influenced the intellectual elite rather than the masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of religious and social reform movements. The Nath Panthi movement directly challenged the rigid caste system and the dominance of Brahmins. The South Indian Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on personal devotion and inclusivity, significantly impacted social dynamics by transcending caste lines. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, while profound and influential, primarily resonated with the intellectual class, leaving its mass appeal limited compared to the more accessible Bhakti movement.  The other options fail to fully encompass the breadth of these movements. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between the impact of different religious movements on various segments of society.


**9. With reference to the reign of Zain-ul-Abidin in Kashmir, consider the following statements:**

1.  Zain-ul-Abidin reversed the policies of religious persecution implemented by his predecessors, promoting religious tolerance.
2.  He significantly contributed to the cultural development of Kashmir, fostering Sanskrit and Persian scholarship and translating significant works.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict Zain-ul-Abidin's reign. He is known for his religious tolerance, reversing previous policies of persecution and promoting harmony between different religious communities. He actively supported cultural development by promoting Sanskrit and Persian scholarship and overseeing translations of major literary and historical texts.  His focus on economic development through agricultural improvements and the introduction of new crafts is also well-documented.  The other options are incomplete, ignoring significant aspects of his rule. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the impact of a ruler's policies on the cultural and economic development of a region.


**10. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The war of succession among Shah Jahan's sons significantly weakened the empire, contributing to its eventual decline.
2.  Aurangzeb's religious policies, while aiming for orthodoxy, inadvertently fueled resistance from various groups within the empire.
3.  The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Jats, and Sikhs exploited the weakening of the central authority, further contributing to the empire's disintegration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate in their assessment of the Mughal Empire's decline. The war of succession severely weakened the central authority and created instability, setting the stage for further fragmentation. Aurangzeb's religious policies, while intended to strengthen the empire's Islamic identity, inadvertently alienated various groups and fueled resistance.  The rise of regional powers capitalized on this weakening, exploiting the central government's vulnerabilities and solidifying their own independent power bases. The other options are incomplete, understating the complex factors contributing to the Mughal Empire's decline.  The question tests factual recall, analytical skills, and the ability to synthesize multiple factors in explaining a historical process.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'amil' was the head of a pargana, responsible for revenue collection at the local level.
2.  Villages were grouped into units of 100 to 84 households, traditionally called 'chaurasi', forming the base of pargana administration.
3.  The 'muqti' was directly responsible for remitting the balance of revenue to the central treasury after meeting local expenditures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 'amil' was indeed the chief revenue official at the pargana level in the Delhi Sultanate's administrative setup.  He was responsible for collecting land revenue and managing the fiscal affairs of his designated area.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly mentions the grouping of villages into units ranging from 100 to 84 households, traditionally known as 'chaurasi'. This structure served as the foundational element of the pargana administrative system.  The organization of villages into these units facilitated revenue collection and local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 'muqti' was responsible for revenue collection within a province (Iqta),  he was not directly responsible for remitting the balance to the central treasury. The process involved multiple layers of accountability and auditing, often leading to delays and harsh penalties if discrepancies were found. The muqti's role was primarily the management of the Iqta, not the final remittance to the central authority. The responsibility of final remittance rested with a higher administrative level.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information about the economic hardships faced by ordinary peasants during the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, evidenced by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay.
3.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and improved looms significantly impacted the production of textiles in the Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable insights into the products, roads, and life of the people during the Delhi Sultanate, it doesn't provide extensive details about the specific economic hardships faced by ordinary peasants under Muhammad Tughlaq. His focus was more on the overall conditions and products rather than detailed economic analysis of the peasant class.

Statement 2 is correct. Ibn Battuta's description of Delhi and Daulatabad as large and prosperous cities, along with the mention of other significant urban centers like Cambay, Lahore, and Multan, strongly supports the existence of a flourishing urban economy in the Sultanate. This urban growth was fueled by expanding trade and commerce.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly indicates that the introduction of the spinning wheel and improved looms led to advancements in textile production during the Delhi Sultanate. These technological improvements enhanced efficiency and quality, contributing to the economic growth of the period.  This improved textile production also significantly boosted the export trade of the Sultanate.


**3. With reference to the social structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of the population during the Delhi Sultanate consisted of prosperous landowner-cultivators who dominated village panchayats.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a significant presence of slaves, employed in various capacities, from domestic service to skilled crafts.
3.  Alauddin Khalji's policies significantly improved the living conditions of ordinary peasants and curtailed the privileges of wealthy landowners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there was a section of prosperous landowner-cultivators, the text clearly states that peasants formed the *overwhelming majority* of the population.  These landowners were a significant but not the dominant segment of the population.  The statement misrepresents the demographic reality.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly discusses the prevalence of slavery in the Delhi Sultanate, highlighting the diverse roles slaves filled, from domestic service to skilled crafts. This was a significant aspect of the social structure of the time.  The text also details the methods of acquiring slaves and their varied treatment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Alauddin Khalji's policies, while targeting the privileges of wealthy landowners, did not necessarily improve the living conditions of ordinary peasants. While some actions might have indirectly benefitted peasants, the primary aim was to curb the power of the landed gentry, not to improve the overall living standards of the peasant population.  Famines and wars continued to plague the peasant class despite Khalji's reforms.


**4. With reference to the economic activities during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate's favorable trade balance resulted in a significant inflow of gold and silver from West Asia and China.
2.  The introduction of superior mortar by the Turks led to advancements in architecture, but had little impact on other industries.
3.  The improved 'rahat' (Persian wheel) technology significantly enhanced irrigation capabilities and agricultural productivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions India's favorable trade balance, primarily due to the export of textiles, leading to an inflow of gold and silver from various trading partners including those in West Asia and China. This influx of precious metals contributed to the economic prosperity of the Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The introduction of superior mortar technology not only revolutionized architecture but also had a significant impact on the metallurgical industry, as it required improved production of materials like lime and bricks.  The statement underestimates the broader economic consequences of this technological advancement.

Statement 3 is correct. The text highlights the improvement of the 'rahat' (Persian wheel) technology, which enabled the lifting of water from deeper levels for irrigation. This technological advancement significantly enhanced irrigation capabilities, boosting agricultural productivity and overall economic output. The improved irrigation system contributed to increased food production and economic stability.


**1. Consider the following statements about the social and economic life of South India during a specific historical period:**

1.  The kings of Southern India, despite often wearing simple cotton clothing, were renowned for their extravagant jewelry, as evidenced by accounts from foreign travelers like Marco Polo and Chau Ju Kua.
2.  While vegetarianism was prevalent in many regions and among certain sections of the population, the consumption of meat, including peacock, horse, and wild pig, was also permitted according to contemporary legal texts (smritis).
3.  The use of intoxicants, though depicted in literary works and seemingly practiced at certain social functions, was portrayed as largely absent by Arab writers, suggesting a potential idealized view of Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of South Indian social and economic life during the period described in the provided text.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the contrast between the simple clothing and the lavish jewelry worn by South Indian royalty, as documented by foreign travelers like Marco Polo and Chau Ju Kua. Their accounts provide valuable insights into the cultural practices and economic disparities within the society.  Statement 2 accurately notes the coexistence of vegetarianism and meat consumption,  demonstrating the nuanced and complex dietary habits of the time. The mention of specific animals (peacock, horse, wild ass, wild cock, wild pig) adds specificity and avoids generalizations. The reference to smriti texts establishes the statement's basis in contemporary legal and social norms. Statement 3 correctly points out the discrepancy between Arab writers' idealized portrayal of the absence of intoxicants and the evidence of wine consumption in literary works. This reveals a potential bias in the historical record and the importance of considering multiple sources when evaluating historical claims.  The inclusion of details regarding ceremonial occasions and even women's participation in wine-drinking adds depth to the understanding of social practices.


**2. With reference to education and religious learning in a specific historical period in India, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 accurately depicts the typical arrangement for higher education, emphasizing the close teacher-student relationship and the varied methods of payment, ranging from fees to personal service. This reflects the socio-economic realities of the time and the individualized nature of learning.  Statement 3 correctly outlines the diversity of subjects taught, including not only religious studies but also logic, philosophy, and political science.  The mention of political morality's popularity amongst the nobility shows the curriculum's adaptation to social needs and aspirations.  The inclusion of Kamandaka's Nitisara as a notable contribution further strengthens the statement's accuracy. The diverse curriculum demonstrates a more holistic approach to education than what might be assumed from a purely religious focus.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

It goes beyond simply intellectual challenges to include direct persecution of monks and temple appropriation, providing a more comprehensive picture than simply focusing on theological debates.  Statement 2 accurately connects the Nath Panthi movement with broader social and religious changes. It correctly identifies the movement's challenge to the existing social order and its concurrence with the rise of Bhakti and Sufi ideals, illustrating a convergence of reformist ideas.  Statement 3 correctly explains the gradual assimilation of Buddhism into Hinduism rather than its complete disappearance. The description of internal developments within Buddhism, leading to practices resembling those in Hinduism, correctly highlights the process of syncretism.  The mention of mantras and the pursuit of supernatural powers provides specific examples that support the statement's core argument.

The detail about substituting Rama for Vishnu and his disregard for caste-based restrictions on cooking and sharing meals is important for distinguishing his contribution. Statement 2 accurately depicts Kabir's critique of traditional Hindu practices and his emphasis on the unity of God, regardless of religious or caste affiliation.  The mention of his trade (weaver) provides context and avoids generalizations.  The description of his inclusive and accessible path reinforces his significance in the Bhakti movement. Statement 3 correctly outlines Guru Nanak's teachings, his emphasis on devotion to one God, and his initial aim of fostering Hindu-Muslim unity rather than founding a new religion.  The inclusion of details about his background (Khatri family) and his travels adds specificity and avoids generalizations. The statement accurately differentiates his approach from the later development of Sikhism as a distinct religion.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may touch upon multiple aspects of Indian history and culture.

**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign saw the Vijayanagara empire's greatest extent of power and wealth, as evidenced by the accounts of numerous foreign travelers including Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq.
2.  The Vijayanagara army under Deva Raya I incorporated elements from the Delhi Sultanate's military structure, including significant numbers of Muslim cavalrymen.
3. The conflict between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani kingdom primarily revolved around religious differences, with little consideration for political or economic factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nicolo Conti's account of Vijayanagara's size and military strength in 1420, and Abdur Razzaq's detailed description of the empire's wealth and extensive territories during Deva Raya II's reign, support the claim of the empire's power and prosperity at that time.  These accounts offer valuable insights into the Vijayanagara empire's peak.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text explicitly mentions Deva Raya I's reorganization of his army, incorporating Muslim cavalry and archery techniques from the Delhi Sultanate, to enhance its combat effectiveness. This strategic move reflects a practical approach to military modernization rather than a rigid adherence to purely regional military traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The conflict between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani kingdom was primarily driven by political and economic factors – control over territories like the Tungabhadra doab, the Krishna-Godavari delta, and access to crucial ports on the western coast (Konkan). While religious differences existed, they were not the primary cause for the prolonged conflict. The struggle for control over resources and trade routes was a key factor.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a significant increase in Hindu participation in the kingdom's administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership marked the peak of the Bahmani kingdom's territorial expansion, encompassing areas like the western coastal regions including Dabhol and Goa.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five independent sultanates, including Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar, which continued to influence Deccan politics for centuries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bahmani kingdom's history.  Statement 1 highlights Firuz Shah's policy of including Hindus in administration, a crucial element of his attempts to foster a more inclusive governance structure. Statement 2 correctly points to Mahmud Gawan's role in expanding the kingdom's reach, particularly along the western coast, which was strategically important for trade.  Statement 3 accurately describes the fragmentation of the Bahmani kingdom into five successor states, each with its own significant political influence in the Deccan region. These successor states played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of the Deccan for a considerable period.


**3. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended Chola influence over the Srivijaya empire, impacting trade routes to China and strengthening Chola maritime dominance in the Bay of Bengal.
2.  The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, a testament to Chola architectural prowess, was completed during the reign of Rajendra Chola I.
3.  The Chola administration, while centralized under the king, also fostered a substantial degree of local self-government, particularly in villages organized as sabhas or mahasabhas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions significantly expanded Chola power and influence in Southeast Asia, affecting trade routes and establishing Chola naval supremacy in the Bay of Bengal.  This maritime expansion was a key element of Chola imperial strategy.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Chola administration, while centralized around the king, also featured a system of local self-governance, especially in villages with assemblies like sabhas and mahasabhas. This decentralized element of administration contributed to the empire's stability and effective governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur was completed during the reign of Rajaraja Chola I, not Rajendra Chola I. While both rulers were significant patrons of temple construction, attributing the completion of this specific temple to Rajendra Chola I is factually incorrect.  This highlights the importance of precise chronological knowledge in understanding the Chola period.

Statement 1 is correct. Ramananda's teachings and actions directly challenged the rigid caste system of his time by accepting disciples from all social strata and encouraging inter-caste interaction.  This revolutionary approach contributed significantly to the movement's popularity.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of God and the rejection of ritualistic practices that divided people along caste and religious lines. His focus was on personal spiritual experience and the equality of all individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's focus was primarily on the worship of Krishna, not Rama.  Furthermore, his teachings emphasized devotional love (bhakti) and kirtan (devotional singing), not austere practices and asceticism.  This demonstrates the diverse approaches within the Bhakti movement itself.


**5. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of India began with the Battle of Tarain in 1191, where Prithviraj Chauhan decisively defeated Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghuri.
2. The Battle of Chandawar in 1194 resulted in the death of Jaichandra, the Gahadavala ruler of Kannauj, paving the way for the Turkish expansion into the Gangetic plain.
3.  Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghuri, after his victories at Tarain, immediately consolidated his rule over the entire Gangetic plain and established a centralized administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Battle of Tarain was a significant event, it resulted in a Ghurid defeat, not a victory for Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghuri.  Prithviraj Chauhan initially won.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Chandawar was crucial in the Turkish conquest of the Gangetic plain, leading to Jaichandra's death and eliminating a major obstacle to further expansion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghuri did not immediately establish centralized rule after Tarain. His conquests were gradual, and the process of establishing firm Turkish control over the Gangetic plain took several years and involved further battles and consolidation efforts.  This highlights the complexities of the early Turkish expansion in India.


These five MCQs demonstrate the application of the specified criteria, creating challenging questions that require in-depth knowledge of Indian history and culture.  The explanations provide detailed justifications for the correct answers and highlight potential distractors to demonstrate the difficulty level.


**1. With reference to the Mughal land revenue system, consider the following statements:**

1. The *zabt* system, associated with Raja Todar Mal, involved measuring land and assessing revenue based on average produce and prices over ten years.
2. The *bazai* or *ghalia-bakiishi* system divided the produce between peasants and the state in a fixed proportion, often assessed before harvest.
3. The *rasag* system was a precise calculation of revenue based on detailed surveys and meticulous record-keeping, eliminating any ambiguity in assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the *zabt* system's core features: land measurement, assessment based on average produce and prices over a decade (*dahsala*), and its association with Raja Todar Mal.  This system aimed for a more equitable and predictable revenue collection compared to earlier methods.  The *dahsala* aspect, calculating averages over ten years, was crucial for mitigating the impact of annual fluctuations in crop yields.

Statement 2 correctly explains the *bazai* system's principle of dividing the harvest between the state and the cultivator in a pre-agreed proportion. This system, while seemingly straightforward, required constant supervision to ensure honesty and fairness. Its simplicity, however, made it prone to manipulation if officials were dishonest.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The *rasag* system was not a precise system based on detailed surveys. It was a rough estimation of the amount payable, often based on past payments. This made it less precise and more prone to inconsistencies than the *zabt* system.  The lack of detailed surveys and record-keeping is a key difference between *rasag* and *zabt*.  Therefore, describing it as eliminating ambiguity is inaccurate.  The *rasag* system, often called *kankut*, relied more on estimation and past experience than on precise measurements.


**2. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mansabdari system assigned a numerical rank (*mansab*) to each officer, indicating both their personal status (*zat*) and the number of cavalrymen they were to maintain (*sawar*).
2.  The *dagh* system involved branding horses with imperial marks to ensure the quality and prevent fraudulent practices, while the *chehra* was a detailed register of soldiers.
3. The Mansabdari system, while initially open to all, predominantly favored those from Central Asian and Iranian backgrounds, with Rajputs and other Indian groups gradually gaining prominence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures the dual nature of the *mansab* rank. The *zat* component reflected the officer's social standing and salary, while the *sawar* component determined the size of their cavalry contingent.  This system was crucial for organizing and maintaining the Mughal army.

Statement 2 correctly describes the *dagh* and *chehra* systems. The *dagh* system, involving branding horses, was a crucial measure to prevent fraud and maintain the quality of the cavalry.  The *chehra*, a detailed register of soldiers, helped in efficient administration and accounting.  Both systems were vital for the effective functioning of the Mansabdari system.

Statement 3 is also correct. While theoretically open to all, the Mansabdari system initially favored those from Central Asia and Iran due to the Mughal rulers’ origins. However, over time, Rajputs and other Indian groups became increasingly important within the system, reflecting the Mughal empire's gradual integration of Indian elites.  This demonstrates the empire's pragmatic approach to incorporating local power structures.


**3. With reference to the economic and social conditions during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  European accounts consistently portray a stark contrast between the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among peasants, artisans, and laborers.
2.  The staple diet of the common people comprised mainly rice, millets, pulses, and vegetables, with meat consumption relatively limited except in certain regions.
3.  The village society was characterized by significant economic inequality, with *khudkashts* (landowning peasants) at the top and landless laborers and artisans at the bottom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the observations of numerous European travelers and traders who documented the vast disparity between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses during the Mughal period. The contrast highlights the deep-seated social and economic inequalities within the empire.

Statement 2 correctly describes the typical diet of the common people, emphasizing the prevalence of grains, pulses, and vegetables.  Meat consumption was less common due to factors like affordability and religious practices. This reflects the agrarian nature of the economy and the dietary limitations of the majority.

Statement 3 correctly depicts the hierarchical structure of village society.  *Khudkashts*, as landowning cultivators, occupied a privileged position compared to landless laborers and artisans, who often faced economic hardship. This highlights the agrarian basis of the social hierarchy and the unequal distribution of resources.  The existence of *muzarians* (tenants) further emphasizes this inequality.


**4.  With reference to Alauddin Khalji's agrarian and market control policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures, including price fixing, were primarily aimed at ensuring a regular supply of cheap foodgrains to the army and urban population.
2.  To achieve his market control objectives, Alauddin Khalji implemented policies such as direct state collection of land revenue in the Doab region, raising the state's share to half the produce.
3. Alauddin Khalji's market regulations were exclusively applied to Delhi, with other towns in the empire largely unaffected by his price controls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures, particularly his price-fixing policies, were fundamentally aimed at ensuring an adequate and affordable supply of essential commodities, especially foodgrains, to sustain his large army and the urban population.  This was crucial for maintaining stability and preventing unrest.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Alauddin Khalji's policy of direct state collection of land revenue in the Doab, coupled with increasing the state's share to half the produce, was a key element of his market control strategy.  This ensured a steady flow of foodgrains to the state-controlled markets, enabling him to maintain fixed prices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the primary focus of Alauddin Khalji's market regulations was Delhi, their influence extended to other parts of the empire. The impact, however, might have varied across regions depending on the effectiveness of implementation and local conditions.  The statement's assertion of complete lack of effect on other towns is inaccurate.


**5. With reference to the social structure and practices during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system continued to be a dominant feature of Hindu society, with Brahmins maintaining a high social standing and Shudras facing significant social restrictions.
2. The practice of *purdah* (female seclusion) became more widespread among upper-class Hindu women during this period, influenced by both social and religious factors.
3.  There was extensive social mingling and interaction between the upper echelons of Hindu and Muslim societies, leading to significant cultural exchange and assimilation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the persistence of the caste system within Hindu society during the Delhi Sultanate.  Brahmins continued to enjoy high social status, while Shudras faced various social and occupational limitations.  The social hierarchy and associated restrictions remained largely intact.

Statement 2 correctly points to the increased prevalence of *purdah* among upper-class Hindu women during this era.  While the practice existed earlier, it gained wider acceptance under the Sultanate, influenced by factors such as social emulation of the ruling class and religious interpretations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While some limited interaction occurred between the upper strata of Hindu and Muslim societies, the extent of social mingling and assimilation was far less than implied in the statement.  Significant social and religious differences often hindered widespread interaction and cultural fusion.  The statement overestimates the degree of social interaction.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed factual recall.

**1. With reference to the economic and social conditions of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajatarangini, a 12th-century Kashmiri text, describes a stark contrast between the opulent lifestyles of courtiers and the widespread poverty among ordinary people.
2.  While food grains were relatively cheap, the high cost of essential items like salt and sugar significantly impacted the poor.
3.  The revenue demand from peasants, though nominally one-sixth of the produce, was often increased by numerous additional cesses and forced labor (vishti).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of medieval Indian economic and social life.  The Rajatarangini's depiction of societal disparity between the elite and the masses is well-documented. The text highlights the relative affordability of grains contrasted with the higher cost of other necessities like salt and sugar, creating a significant burden for the poor. The one-sixth revenue demand was a standard, but the addition of numerous cesses and forced labor like *vishti* substantially increased the peasant's tax burden, a common feature of the era.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial details from the overall picture of economic and social stratification during this period.


**2. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of the Samantas, also known as Mriks or Rajputs, involved diverse origins, including government officials, defeated rulers, local chiefs, and tribal leaders.
2.  While theoretically temporary, revenue assignments (bhukti or fiefs) often became hereditary, leading to the growth of a powerful landed aristocracy.
3.  The term 'feudal' is applied to this societal structure, despite lacking the precise features of European feudalism, primarily due to the commonality of income derived from peasant surplus without direct land cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe the socio-political changes in medieval India. The diverse origins of the Samantas, their hierarchical structure, and the evolution of revenue assignments into hereditary fiefs are well-established historical facts. The application of the term 'feudal' to the Indian context, while acknowledging the differences from the European model, highlights the shared characteristic of a ruling class extracting surplus from peasant production without direct participation in cultivation.  The other options are incomplete representations of the complexities of the social and political hierarchy during this time.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the religious and cultural landscape of Medieval India:**

1.  The Dilwara temple at Mount Abu exemplifies the patronage of Jainism by the Chalukya rulers of Gujarat.
2.  The Bhakti movement, led by Nayanmars and Alvars in South India, emphasized love and devotion, rejecting austerities and transcending caste distinctions.
3.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, emphasizing the non-dualism of God and the world, provided a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate descriptions of religious and cultural aspects of Medieval India.  The Dilwara temples are indeed a prime example of the architectural grandeur of Jainism under Chalukya patronage. The Bhakti movement's emphasis on love, devotion, and its inclusive nature, challenging caste hierarchies, is a key feature of this period. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta significantly impacted the intellectual and philosophical landscape, offering a powerful counterpoint to existing religious traditions like Buddhism and Jainism. The exclusion of any statement would leave out a crucial element of the religious and cultural evolution during this era.


**4. With reference to the economic activities and trade during Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds were prominent in facilitating India's extensive overseas trade, particularly with Southeast Asia.
2.  The decline of long-distance trade in North India led to a decline in the influence of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) and a shift towards greater local self-sufficiency.
3.  India's overseas trade, especially with China, involved significant participation from Indian traders, particularly from the Tamil country, Kalinga, and Gujarat, using Indian-built ships.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately portray aspects of Medieval Indian economic life. The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds played a critical role in the flourishing maritime trade. The shift towards local self-sufficiency in North India, alongside a decline in the power of guilds, is a documented historical trend.  Indian traders, using Indian-built ships, were crucial players in the overseas trade network with China.  Therefore, omitting any of these statements would present an incomplete picture of the period's complex trade dynamics.


**5. With reference to the lifestyles of the ruling classes and the general population in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers often noted the stark contrast between the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty experienced by ordinary people, particularly peasants and artisans.
2.  While the diet of the common people consisted mainly of rice, millets, pulses, and vegetables, the availability of milk and milk products was relatively high due to widespread cattle rearing.
3.  The wages of unskilled laborers remained relatively stagnant throughout the period, resulting in a low standard of living for a large segment of the population despite the abundance of cultivable land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the economic realities of Medieval India.  European accounts consistently highlight the vast disparity between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses.  The relatively high availability of milk and milk products due to significant cattle-rearing is a notable aspect of the common people's diet.  The stagnation of unskilled laborer wages, despite ample cultivable land, is a key factor contributing to their low standard of living.  Therefore, any option excluding one or more of these statements would fail to capture the complete picture of economic inequality during this era.


**1. With reference to the Ghaznavid conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud of Ghazni's initial raids targeted the Hindushahi rulers of Peshawar and the Punjab, whose capital was Waihind (Peshawar).
2.  The Hindushahi ruler Jayapala, in alliance with the Bhati ruler of Multan and the Amir of Multan, unsuccessfully invaded Ghazni before Mahmud's retaliatory raids.
3.  Mahmud's campaign against Somnath in Gujarat, in 1025, was primarily motivated by a desire to annex the region and establish a stable Ghaznavid presence in Western India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Mahmud of Ghazni's initial military objectives in India. His early campaigns were focused on weakening and eventually subjugating the Hindushahi kingdom, which controlled significant territories in the Punjab region. Waihind (modern-day Peshawar) served as their capital, making it a strategically important target for Mahmud's expansionist ambitions.

Statement 2 correctly describes the preemptive alliance formed against Mahmud.  Jayapala, the Hindushahi ruler, recognizing the growing threat from Ghazni, attempted a coalition with other regional powers to counter Mahmud’s growing power. This alliance, however, proved unsuccessful, leading to Mahmud’s subsequent retaliatory raids.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mahmud’s raid on Somnath was undoubtedly motivated by the temple's immense wealth, the primary objective was not territorial annexation.  His raids were largely focused on plunder and the destruction of Hindu temples, aiming to establish his dominance and prestige rather than creating long-term administrative control over conquered territories.  His campaigns were characterized by swift raids, plunder, and the destruction of temples, not the establishment of lasting political control.  This is a key difference between his approach and later Turkish conquests.



**2. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of the people under the Delhi Sultanate, including prices of commodities and agricultural practices.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a decline in long-distance trade within India, leading to a decline in trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in North India.
3.  The growth of towns during the Delhi Sultanate was primarily driven by the expansion of agricultural production and the subsequent increase in rural prosperity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ibn Battuta's detailed account offers valuable insights into the economic aspects of the Delhi Sultanate. His observations on prices of commodities, agricultural production, and the general lifestyle of the people provide a glimpse into the economic realities of the era.  His travels across India offer a unique perspective on various regions and their economic activities.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Delhi Sultanate saw the growth of some urban centers, the decline of long-distance internal trade is a significant aspect of its economic history. This decline impacted trade guilds, which often relied on extensive trade networks that spanned considerable distances. The reduced reliance on long-distance trade consequently affected the power and influence of these guilds in northern India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The growth of towns during the Delhi Sultanate was not solely driven by agricultural prosperity. While agricultural production played a role, the growth of towns was also influenced by factors like the establishment of administrative centers, military garrisons, and the expansion of trade, both internal and external. The urban centers served as hubs for various economic activities, not just as reflections of rural agricultural success.



**3. With reference to the military organization under the Mughals, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal mansabdari system strictly separated military and civilian roles, with distinct career paths for each.
2.  Mansabdars were solely responsible for maintaining their own stipulated quotas of horses, elephants, and transport animals.
3.  Akbar's "gentleman troopers" (ahadis) were comparable to the knights of medieval Europe, serving as elite bodyguards directly answerable to the emperor.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mughal mansabdari system did not maintain a strict separation between military and civilian roles.  Many mansabdars held both military and administrative positions, often simultaneously. Their responsibilities could encompass military command, revenue collection, and other administrative duties, blurring the lines between the two.  The system was designed for flexibility and efficiency, not rigid compartmentalization.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While mansabdars were initially responsible for maintaining their own quotas of horses, elephants, and transport animals, this responsibility shifted over time.  Later in the Mughal period, these resources were increasingly managed centrally by the state, though the mansabdars still bore the financial burden of their upkeep through their salaries.  The system evolved to better manage and control resources.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar’s ahadis were indeed comparable to medieval European knights in their function and status.  They acted as elite bodyguards directly loyal to the emperor, forming a select group of warriors with noble lineage, high salaries, and a distinct organizational structure separate from the regular army.  This comparison highlights the similarities between elite warrior classes in different historical contexts.


**4. With reference to the socio-religious dynamics during the period of Rajput-Brahman alliances, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste, emerging prominently during this period, consisted solely of individuals from Brahman origins who served in royal establishments.
2.  The expansion of Hinduism during this era involved the absorption of Buddhists and Jains, but excluded indigenous tribes.
3.  The social position of Shudras improved gradually, with increased access to smarta rituals, despite restrictions on Vedic studies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kayastha caste, while originating from individuals serving in royal establishments, did not exclusively consist of Brahmans.  It was a heterogeneous group, including individuals from various castes, who gradually coalesced into a distinct social group.  Its development reflects the complexities of caste formation and social mobility during the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The expansion of Hinduism during this period was inclusive, encompassing not only Buddhists and Jains but also a significant number of indigenous tribes. This process of assimilation often involved the adaptation and integration of pre-existing tribal customs, beliefs, and deities within the broader Hindu framework, highlighting the dynamic nature of religious change.

Statement 3 is correct. The social position of Shudras underwent a gradual improvement during this era.  While they remained excluded from Vedic studies, their access to smarta rituals—related to important life-cycle events—expanded, signifying a certain degree of social elevation.  This change reflects the evolving social dynamics and the influence of various factors on caste hierarchies.


**5. With reference to the Bengali Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign marked a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many renowned Bengali writers flourishing under his patronage.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquest of Kamata resulted in the complete subjugation of the Ahom kingdom and the integration of its territories into the Bengali Sultanate.
3.  The rulers of the Bengali Sultanate successfully maintained control over the Brahmaputra valley in modern-day Assam throughout their reign, despite facing resistance from local kingdoms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is widely considered a golden age for Bengali literature.  His liberal policies, including the appointment of Hindus to high offices, fostered a climate conducive to artistic and intellectual growth, leading to the flourishing of Bengali literature during his rule. This highlights the interplay between political patronage and cultural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquest of Kamata was significant, it did not lead to the complete subjugation of the Ahom kingdom. The Ahom kingdom, located further east in the Brahmaputra valley, remained largely independent despite facing occasional military pressure from the Bengali Sultanate.  The territorial extent of the conquests needs careful consideration.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bengali Sultanate's attempts to control the Brahmaputra valley were consistently met with resistance from the Ahom kingdom and other local powers.  The rulers of the Sultanate faced repeated setbacks and were unable to establish lasting control over this region. The statement oversimplifies a complex history of conflict and resistance.


**1. With reference to the socio-political landscape of 15th-century Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) is widely regarded as a period of decline for the Bengali language.
2.  Rupa and Sanatan, renowned Vaishnava brothers, held high positions in Alauddin Hussain Shah's court, with one serving as the Sultan's private secretary.
3. The Ahom kingdom, originally a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had fully resisted Hinduization by the 15th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) is actually considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many prominent Bengali writers flourishing during his rule. The text explicitly states that a brilliant period began under his rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that Rupa and Sanatan, celebrated as pious Vaishnavas, held high posts under Alauddin Hussain Shah, with one serving as his private secretary. This demonstrates the Sultan's relatively liberal policy towards Hindus.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ahom kingdom, while originating as a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had undergone a process of Hinduization by the time of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign.  The text explicitly notes their Hinduization over time and even mentions that the greatest Ahom ruler, Suhungmung, changed his name to Svarga Narayana, indicative of this Hindu adoption.


**2. With reference to the administrative practices of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'amil' was responsible for auditing the accounts of the muqtis, a process often involving harsh measures like torture.
2.  Villages in the Delhi Sultanate were traditionally grouped into units of exactly 84 households, forming the basis of the parganas.
3. Firuz Tughlaq significantly increased the harshness of the auditing process for muqtis, leading to widespread unrest.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The text indicates that the muqti was responsible for remitting the balance of income to the center after meeting expenses.  Auditing, often harsh, including torture and imprisonment, was a part of this process. While the text doesn't explicitly say the 'amil' *directly* conducted the torture, the implication is strong that they were involved in the process, given their role in revenue collection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that villages were grouped into units of 100 to 84 households, not *exactly* 84.  The use of a range demonstrates the variability in village size and structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage states that Firuz Tughlaq *relaxed* the harshness associated with the auditing of muqti accounts, not increased it.  This represents a significant policy shift towards the end of the Sultanate.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information on the economic hardship faced by ordinary people during Muhammad Tughlaq's reign.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate saw a flourishing urban economy, evidenced by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay.
3.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow significantly reduced the skill required for textile production in the Delhi Sultanate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account offers insights into various aspects of life in the Delhi Sultanate, including products and the condition of roads, it does not provide *detailed* information on the economic hardships faced by ordinary people. His focus is more on the overall state of the country and its products.

Statement 2 is correct. The growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Cambay, Lahore, Multan, Kara, Lakhnauti, and Anhilwara (Patan) is explicitly cited as evidence of a flourishing urban economy during the Sultanate period.  The text directly links this urban growth to large-scale commerce.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow improved the efficiency and quality of cotton processing, but the text explicitly states that the most important factor in textile production remained the skill of Indian craftsmen.  The new technologies complemented, rather than replaced, existing skills.


**4. With reference to the cultural interactions during the period of Rajput and Sultanate interaction, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghaznavid conquests primarily focused on plunder, leading to frequent raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana, met with strong Rajput resistance.
2.  The Sufi preachers, while primarily targeting Muslim settlers, had no discernible influence on the Hindu population.
3.  The rise of the Ghurid empire in Central Asia directly resulted in the immediate end of all interactions between Muslims and Hindus in North India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes the initial Ghaznavid conquests as driven by plunder, resulting in raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana.  It also notes the significant Rajput resistance to these raids.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that Sufi preachers, while mainly focusing on Muslim settlers, did influence some Hindus, initiating a process of interaction between Islam and Hindu society.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The rise of the Ghurids did lead to major changes, but it did not immediately end all interactions between Muslims and Hindus. The text details a pre-existing interaction involving trade and the presence of Sufi preachers, which continued even after the Ghurid conquests.  The Ghurid conquests fundamentally shifted the power dynamics but did not immediately erase prior interactions.


**5. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in post-classical India (8th-12th centuries CE), consider the following statements:**

1. The emergence of the samantas, a class of regional chiefs, led to a decrease in the burden on common people due to increased local self-sufficiency.
2. The decline of long-distance trade within India led to the rise of powerful trade guilds or shrenis in North India.
3.  Bans on travel beyond certain geographical boundaries were strictly enforced, significantly impacting India's overseas trade.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rise of the samantas, while leading to increased local self-sufficiency, did not necessarily decrease the burden on common people. The text mentions that the expanding power of these regional chiefs increased the burdens on the common man through additional taxes and forced labor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decline of long-distance trade within India actually led to a *decline* of powerful trade guilds or shrenis in North India, not their rise. The text explicitly links the decline of long-distance trade to the decline of these guilds.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Bans on travel, while mentioned in some Dharmashastras, were not strictly enforced. The text itself points out that Indian merchants, philosophers, and craftsmen continued to travel to West Asia and other regions, indicating that these bans were not absolute barriers to trade or interaction.


**6. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a prominent Iranian minister, significantly expanded the Bahmani kingdom's territory through annexations in the east and control over western coastal areas.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's internal strife was primarily between the established Deccanis and the newly arrived foreigners (Afghans).
3. Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included the establishment of a rigorous system of land measurement and revenue collection that completely eliminated all existing inequalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly details Mahmud Gawan's role in expanding the Bahmani kingdom's territory through annexations in the east and acquisition of western coastal areas, including Dabhol and Goa. His military and administrative prowess is highlighted.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions the internal strife within the Bahmani kingdom, primarily between the long-established Deccanis and the newcomers (Afghans, also called gharibs). This division played a crucial role in the kingdom's eventual disintegration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mahmud Gawan did attempt to improve land measurement and revenue collection, the text does not claim that his reforms completely eliminated existing inequalities. The passage focuses on his efforts to fix the amounts paid by cultivators but doesn't suggest a complete eradication of inequalities within the system.  The persistent internal strife suggests the continuation of inequalities.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its interactions with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya II's reign was marked by consistent and undisputed control over the Krishna-Godavari basin and the Tungabhadra doab.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers extracted regular tribute from countries like Pegu and Tenasserim, demonstrating their naval strength.
3.  Krishna Deva Raya successfully defeated the Bijapur ruler in 1520, pushing him across the Krishna River, but failed to secure control of the Tungabhadra doab.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Deva Raya II's reign saw Vijayanagara as a powerful state, the text mentions ongoing struggles for control over the Krishna-Godavari basin and the Tungabhadra doab with the Bahmani kingdom.  The text doesn't present his control as undisputed or consistent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text casts doubt on the extent of Vijayanagara's ability to extract *regular* tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim, suggesting that the relationship may have been more about diplomatic gifts and embassies rather than consistent tributary payments.  The claim of naval strength is also debated.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Krishna Deva Raya did defeat the Bijapur ruler in 1520 and pushed him across the Krishna River.  However, the text also mentions that he *did* renew the struggle for control of the Tungabhadra doab, implying he ultimately succeeded in securing at least some measure of control over that area.


**8. With reference to the Chola Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of the Pandya and Chera countries and Sri Lanka was achieved without any significant resistance.
2. The Chola administration was characterized by a complete lack of local self-government, with all power centralized in the hands of the king.
3.  Chola rulers sent multiple embassies to China, primarily for diplomatic and commercial purposes, resulting in significant economic gains for the Chola Empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajendra I's conquests, while successful, were not achieved without resistance.  The text mentions battles and the capture of royal insignia, indicating significant conflict during the process of subjugation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chola administration, while having a powerful central authority in the king, did incorporate a significant degree of local self-government, particularly in the form of village assemblies like the ur and the sabha (or mahasabha).  The text details the functioning of these bodies.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions multiple Chola embassies to China for both diplomatic and commercial reasons.  While the passage doesn't quantify the "significant economic gains", the presence of trade and the exchange of goods are clearly presented.


**9.  With reference to the cultural developments in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau's writings indicate that regional languages were not used for common purposes of life until after the arrival of the Turks.
2.  The Bhakti movement played no significant role in the development and popularization of regional languages.
3. The Vijayanagara rulers exclusively patronized Telugu literature, neglecting other regional languages like Kannada and Tamil.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Amir Khusrau's writings actually acknowledge the pre-existing use of regional languages for everyday purposes, stating that these languages had been used "from ancient times". The text contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement is explicitly linked to the rise and popularization of regional languages. The saints' use of common languages for their teachings and compositions is presented as a major factor in the development of these languages.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Krishna Deva Raya extended patronage to Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil poets alike, demonstrating that his patronage was not limited to Telugu alone.  The claim of exclusive patronage is false.


**1. With reference to the economic conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread prosperity in India, with only the ruling classes enjoying luxurious lifestyles.
2.  The staple diet of ordinary people consisted primarily of rice, millet, pulses, and occasionally fish or meat, depending on region.
3.  The high cost of leather is cited as a reason for the limited use of footwear in northern India, excluding Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While European accounts often highlighted the opulence of the ruling classes, they also documented the widespread poverty and meager living conditions of the majority of the population—peasants, artisans, and laborers.  Accounts from Babur, Ralph Fitch, and De Laet all describe the scanty clothing worn by ordinary people.  This paints a picture of stark economic disparity, not uniform prosperity.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that rice, millet, and pulses formed the staple diet of the common people, supplemented by fish in coastal and Bengal regions and meat in the south.  This highlights the agrarian nature of the economy and the reliance on basic food crops. The mention of "khicheri" further supports this.

Statement 3 is correct. Moreland's observation that shoes were rarely mentioned north of the Narmada (except Bengal) and attributed this to the high cost of leather.  This points to a specific economic factor influencing the daily lives of the people. The availability and cost of resources played a significant role in shaping their standard of living.


**2. With reference to the social structure of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The village society was characterized by significant equality, with land ownership distributed fairly among different castes.
2.  The khudkashts, who owned the land they cultivated, often belonged to a single dominant caste and exploited weaker sections.
3.  The landless peasants and laborers, often from untouchable castes, suffered the most during famines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly describes the village society as "highly unequal."  The existence of khudkashts (who owned land and often belonged to dominant castes) and muzarians (tenants paying higher revenue) demonstrates a clear hierarchy and unequal distribution of land resources. This inequality was a defining feature of the social structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly states that the khudkashts, often belonging to dominant castes, exploited weaker sections of the village society.  This highlights the power dynamics within the village and the system of social hierarchy.  Their position allowed them to control resources and labor.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that during famines (which were frequent), the landless peasants and village artisans (often from untouchable castes) suffered the most. This underscores the vulnerability of the marginalized sections of society to economic shocks. Their lack of resources made them particularly susceptible to hardship.



**3. With reference to the economic activities of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian economy during the 17th century lacked diversification, primarily focusing on a limited range of crops.
2.  The Mughal state played a negligible role in agricultural development, leaving the expansion and improvement of cultivation entirely to local efforts.
3.  The introduction of new crops like tobacco and maize in the 17th century, and potato and red chilies in the 18th century, demonstrates the Indian cultivator’s adaptability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly describes the Indian economy as "well diversified," with cultivation of a wide variety of crops including wheat, rice, gram, barley, pulses, bajra, cotton, indigo, sugarcane, and oilseeds. This diversity is a key feature of the economic landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions that the Mughal state provided incentives and loans (taccavi) to peasants for the expansion and improvement of cultivation. While local efforts were crucial, the Mughal state played a significant role in supporting agricultural development through financial assistance and policies.

Statement 3 is correct. The adoption of tobacco and maize in the 17th century and potato and red chilies in the 18th century illustrates the willingness of Indian cultivators to adopt new crops if they were deemed profitable. This demonstrates adaptability and responsiveness to market opportunities.  It contradicts the image of a static, unchanging agricultural system.



**4. With reference to the living conditions in medieval Indian cities, consider the following statements:**

1. The lowest-paid servants in medieval Indian cities earned significantly more than two rupees a month, according to European travelers.
2.  Artisans and workers in medieval Indian cities generally enjoyed a high standard of living comparable to that of the ruling classes.
3. Moreland's research suggests that the real wages of workers in medieval India remained relatively stable over time, with a balanced diet but higher costs for certain goods like clothing and sugar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. European travelers reported that the lowest-paid servants earned *less* than two rupees a month. This highlights the low wages and challenging living conditions faced by a significant portion of the urban population. The two rupee figure represents a minimum wage, not a common one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the largest section of the urban population consisted of the poor—artisans, servants, slaves, and manual laborers. This contradicts the claim of a high standard of living comparable to the ruling classes.  There was a vast disparity between the rich and the poor.

Statement 3 is correct. Moreland's observation that real wages remained relatively stable, with a balanced diet but higher costs for certain goods, accurately reflects the text's description of the situation.  This suggests a lack of significant improvement in living standards, despite some elements of stability.  The comparison with European wage growth further emphasizes the relative stagnation in India.


**5. With reference to the agricultural policies of Muhammad Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq continued Alauddin Khalji's policy of reducing village headmen to the status of ordinary cultivators.
2.  Muhammad Tughlaq's agrarian reforms, aimed at increasing land revenue and improving cultivation, were largely successful during his reign.
3.  The establishment of the *diwan-i-amir-i-kohi* department was part of Muhammad Tughlaq's efforts to extend and improve cultivation in the Doab region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Muhammad Tughlaq *did not* believe in Alauddin Khalji's policy of reducing village headmen.  He sought adequate land revenue but through different means. This highlights a key difference in their approaches to agrarian administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text describes Muhammad Tughlaq's agrarian reforms as having a "disastrous" outcome during his reign.  The peasant rebellion, over-assessment, and famine all contributed to the failure of his policies, despite long-term potential benefits.  This shows the limitations of his administration.

Statement 3 is correct. The creation of the *diwan-i-amir-i-kohi* department is mentioned as a specific part of Muhammad Tughlaq’s efforts to extend and improve cultivation in the Doab region.  This shows his intent and the mechanisms he employed, even if they ultimately failed.  The department's role in providing loans and encouraging superior crops is noted.


**6. With reference to the social and economic impact of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delhi Sultanate's expansion of irrigation techniques led to a decline in the power of local chiefs and samantas.
2.  The decline of long-distance trade within India under the Delhi Sultanate resulted in the decline of trade guilds and shrenis.
3. The Delhi Sultanate significantly restricted overseas trade, resulting in a decline in India's interaction with Southeast Asia and China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text suggests that the expansion of cultivation, likely facilitated by improved irrigation, actually *strengthened* the position of local chiefs and samantas. This shows the unintended consequences of certain economic developments.  The increased agricultural output likely increased their power and influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The decline of long-distance trade within India under the Sultanate is linked to a decline in trade guilds and shrenis. This demonstrates the interconnectedness of economic structures and the impact of political changes on economic organizations.  The loss of long-distance trade reduced the guilds’ importance and role.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text describes the continued growth of India’s overseas trade with Southeast Asia and China during the period. This demonstrates that the Sultanate did not restrict this trade. In fact, the text highlights the active role of Indian traders and the importance of this trade for various regions.


**7. With reference to the cultural developments during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl was a leading poet of the Mughal era, while his brother, Faizi, was a renowned historian and prose writer.
2.  The Mughal court attracted many Persian poets and scholars, but Hindu contributions to Persian literature were minimal.
3.  The translation of the Mahabharata into Persian was undertaken under the supervision of Faizi, Abul Fazl's brother.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Abul Fazl was the leading historian and prose writer, while his brother Faizi was the leading poet.  This highlights their respective roles in shaping Mughal-era literature.  Their contributions are clearly differentiated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that Hindus *did* contribute to the growth of Persian literature during the Mughal period.  This shows the cultural exchange and integration that occurred.  The statement underestimates the participation of Hindu scholars and writers.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage directly states that Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.  This points to a specific example of cultural exchange and the role of Hindu scholars in the Mughal translation project.  The supervision by Faizi demonstrates the Mughal commitment to this significant undertaking.


**8. With reference to the early Turkish incursions into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids into India were primarily motivated by a desire to spread Islam and convert the local population.
2. The Hindushahi rulers of Punjab offered strong resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's invasions, but lacked significant support from Rajput rulers.
3. Mahmud of Ghazni's most significant military victory was his conquest of Delhi and establishment of a permanent Turkish base in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mahmud presented his raids as jihad, the primary motivation was plunder and wealth acquisition.  The text emphasizes the vast riches Mahmud gained from his raids on temples and cities.  Religious zeal was a secondary factor, serving to justify the plunder.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hindushahi rulers resisted Mahmud's invasions, but the lack of support from Rajput rulers is highlighted.  The Shahis fought largely alone, indicating the political fragmentation and lack of unified resistance against the Turkish incursions.  This demonstrates the political landscape at the time.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mahmud of Ghazni did not conquer Delhi.  His raids were focused on plunder and wealth acquisition; he did not aim for long-term territorial control in most cases.  Delhi remained outside of his control.  His focus was on the richest targets, not systematic conquest.



**1. With reference to the Pala Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Devapala, son of Dharmapala, extended Pala control over Pragjyotishpur (Assam) and parts of Orissa during his 40-year reign.
2.  The Pala kingdom, referred to as Ruhma by Sulaiman, a 9th-century Arab merchant, engaged in conflicts with the Pratiharas and Rashtrakutas, possessing a large military force.
3.  Nalanda University, revived by Dharmapala, and Vikramshila University, founded by him, were solely dedicated to Buddhist studies and excluded other religious disciplines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Historical accounts confirm Devapala's expansion of the Pala empire into Assam and parts of Orissa during his reign (AD 810-850).  Statement 2 is also correct. Sulaiman's account mentions the Pala kingdom's significant military strength and its involvement in conflicts with neighboring empires. The mention of the large army, though potentially exaggerated, indicates a substantial military presence.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. While the Palas were great patrons of Buddhist learning and established renowned universities,  evidence suggests they also extended patronage to Saivism and Vaishnavism, indicating religious tolerance and a broader cultural influence beyond Buddhism.  The universities weren't exclusively focused on Buddhist studies.


**2. With reference to the Pratihara Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gurjara-Pratiharas, originating from Gurjara pastoralists, initially established principalities in central and western Rajasthan.
2.  Nagabhatta I, a prominent Pratihara ruler, successfully repelled significant Arab incursions into Rajasthan and Gujarat.
3. Bhoja, considered the greatest Pratihara ruler, extended his empire's reach to the western side of the Sutlej River but failed to conquer the Deccan region completely.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Pratihara dynasty. Statement 1 correctly identifies the origins and early territorial expansion of the Pratiharas. Statement 2 accurately describes Nagabhatta I's successful defense against Arab incursions, a crucial event in shaping the dynasty's early power. Statement 3 accurately portrays Bhoja's significant achievements and limitations. While he expanded the empire considerably, including to the west of the Sutlej, his ambitions in the Deccan were ultimately checked by conflicts with the Rashtrakutas.  The statements collectively present a balanced and accurate overview of the Pratihara's history.


**3. With reference to the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Dantidurga, the founder of the Rashtrakuta kingdom, established Manyakhet (Malkhed) as its capital, quickly dominating northern Maharashtra.
2. Govinda III's military successes included subjugating Kerala, Pandya, Chola, and Pallava kingdoms, extending Rashtrakuta power across the southern peninsula.
3. Amoghavarsha, known for his literary pursuits, completely suppressed rebellions within the vast Rashtrakuta empire during his long reign, ensuring its stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is historically accurate. Dantidurga's establishment of Manyakhet as the capital and his consolidation of power in northern Maharashtra are well-documented.  Statement 2, while highlighting Govinda III's military prowess, is an overstatement. While he achieved significant victories, complete subjugation of all the mentioned kingdoms was not achieved. The description is exaggerated to mislead the examinee.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Amoghavarsha's reign, though marked by literary achievements, faced numerous rebellions that were not entirely suppressed, contributing to the eventual decline of the empire after his death.  Only statement 1 represents a completely accurate depiction of the Rashtrakuta historical narrative.


**4. With reference to the religious and social movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Siva and Vishnu, rejecting austerities and emphasizing a personal bond between the devotee and God, primarily through Tamil language teachings.
2.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, strongly opposed the caste system, child marriage, and promoted widow remarriage, primarily in Karnataka.
3.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, emphasizing the non-dualism of God and the world, posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism but failed to influence the masses due to its complexity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in its description of Bhakti, but it is misleading by stating that it primarily used Tamil. While the Alvars in South India used Tamil, the Bhakti movement encompassed many languages and regions.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the core tenets and social reforms advocated by the Lingayat movement. Statement 3 correctly identifies Sankara's philosophical challenge to other religions and the inherent limitations in its mass appeal due to its complex nature. However, it is misleading by stating that it completely failed to influence the masses. While its direct impact on the masses might have been limited, it influenced later religious and philosophical discourse in Hinduism significantly.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the political landscape of North India during the 12th and 13th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of the Abbasid Caliphate led to the rise of several independent Turkish states in West and Central Asia, characterized by internal strife and frequent changes in power.
2.  The Ghurid Sultanate, under Muizzuddin Muhammad, after consolidating power in the Punjab, decisively defeated Prithviraj Chauhan at the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192, marking a turning point in Indian history.
3. Jaichandra, the Gahadavala ruler of Kanauj, actively allied with Prithviraj Chauhan against the Ghurids, contributing significantly to the defeat of the Ghurids at the First Battle of Tarain.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the political instability in Central Asia following the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate and the rise of various Turkish states. Statement 2 correctly identifies Muizzuddin Muhammad's victory at the Second Battle of Tarain as a pivotal moment, leading to the establishment of Turkish rule in North India.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Jaichandra's neutrality or even opposition to Prithviraj Chauhan at the First Battle of Tarain is a well-established historical fact, highlighting the lack of united resistance against the Ghurids.  The other options are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 3.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the payment of tribute to Vijayanagara by kings of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim, demonstrating Vijayanagara's extensive influence and control over maritime trade.
2.  The Italian traveler Nicolo Conti's account of Vijayanagara in 1420 describes a vast city with a large army, emphasizing its military strength and power, but understates its population.
3.  Abdur Razzaq's description of Vijayanagara under Deva Raya II mentions the city's seven citadels and walls, elaborate markets, and canals, highlighting its advanced urban planning and infrastructure but overstates the size of its army.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1, while using the word "tribute", is largely accurate in reflecting Vijayanagara's influence and its engagement with various Southeast Asian kingdoms.  The nature of the relationship might have varied, but it signifies a significant level of interaction and influence. Statement 2 is partially correct in noting Conti's description of Vijayanagara's military might. However, it's misleading in suggesting Conti understates the population.  Statement 3 accurately captures Abdur Razzaq's vivid description of the city's architecture and infrastructure.  The numbers provided by foreign travellers are often exaggerated or unreliable, so we should avoid such direct comparisons. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are largely accurate, though with some nuances in interpretation.


**7. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign saw a significant increase in Hindu participation in the administration, particularly in revenue collection, creating a balance against foreign influence.
2.  Mahmud Gawan, a prominent prime minister, significantly expanded the Bahmani kingdom through military conquests in the east and west, including the capture of important coastal ports like Dabhol and Goa.
3. The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration into five successor states—Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar—followed directly after the death of Mahmud Gawan, due to a power vacuum and lack of a strong successor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of inclusivity in the administration. Statement 2 correctly highlights Mahmud Gawan's significant contributions to the Bahmani kingdom's expansion.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The disintegration of the Bahmani kingdom was a gradual process, not an immediate consequence of Mahmud Gawan's death. While his execution contributed to the instability, internal conflicts and power struggles among nobles had been ongoing for some time before his death. The process of fragmentation took several years.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**8. With reference to the Bhakti movement in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, focused on the worship of Rama and disregarded caste restrictions in his teachings, accepting disciples from all varnas.
2. Kabir, known for his emphasis on the unity of God and his criticism of idol worship and religious rituals, was a social reformer who actively worked to dismantle the caste system.
3. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, while emphasizing the oneness of God and rejecting caste distinctions, primarily focused on personal spiritual transformation through the guidance of a guru.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Ramananda's teachings and his inclusive approach towards disciples from all castes. Statement 3 accurately captures the essence of Guru Nanak's teachings, emphasizing personal spiritual growth and the importance of a guru. Statement 2 is partially correct in describing Kabir's beliefs, but it is an oversimplification to label him solely as a social reformer actively working to dismantle the caste system. His primary focus was on individual spiritual transformation, though his teachings implicitly challenged the rigidities of the caste system.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the oversimplification of Kabir's role.


**9. With reference to the Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily motivated by the desire for plunder and the destruction of Hindu temples, aiming to establish a large and stable empire in India.
2. The Hindushahi kingdom, ruling over Peshawar and the Punjab, offered significant resistance to Mahmud's early invasions, but ultimately succumbed due to a lack of support from Rajput rulers.
3.  Mahmud's successful raids into the Indo-Gangetic plains, including Kanauj and Somnath, were facilitated by the absence of a strong, unified political power in North India at that time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in identifying Mahmud's plundering motives. However, it is misleading by stating that his primary aim was to establish a stable empire. His raids were primarily focused on plunder and wealth acquisition, not long-term territorial control. Statement 2 accurately describes the Hindushahi resistance and the lack of Rajput support, contributing to their downfall. Statement 3 correctly highlights the political fragmentation in North India as a key factor contributing to the success of Mahmud's raids.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the text, creating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging.  I have focused on creating high-quality, difficult questions rather than a large quantity.


**1. With reference to the socio-cultural dynamics of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste, emerging prominently during this period, initially comprised individuals from diverse castes employed in royal establishments.
2.  The practice of *sati*, while mandated by some writers, faced condemnation from others, with its prevalence influenced by factors like property disputes among leading chiefs.
3.  Despite generally perceived mental inferiority and limited educational opportunities, women from upper classes showcased literary and artistic skills, as evidenced in dramatic works and stories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Medieval Indian society.  Statement 1 correctly describes the heterogeneous origins of the Kayastha caste, initially encompassing individuals from various varna groups serving in royal courts. This highlights the fluidity and evolving nature of the caste system. Statement 2 accurately points out the contested nature of *sati*, with some religious and legal texts advocating for it while others condemned it. The explanation further notes the influence of socio-economic factors, such as property rights and inheritance disputes, on the practice's prevalence.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the complex reality of women's lives in Medieval India. While often relegated to domestic roles and denied formal education, certain segments, particularly those in upper classes, exhibited literary and artistic talents, as reflected in surviving literary and artistic works.  The options effectively act as distractors, testing the examinee's knowledge of each specific fact.


**2. With reference to the Rajput period in Indian history, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput clan system, while fostering brotherhood, also led to protracted inter-clan feuds hindering unified resistance against external threats.
2.  The architectural style prevalent during the Rajput period, known as the Nagara style, was characterized by tall, curved, spiral roofs and intricate carvings, with prominent examples found in Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar.
3.  The Rajput rulers, while primarily patrons of Hinduism, also extended patronage to Jainism, as exemplified by Vastupala's construction of a Jain temple at Mount Abu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of the Rajput period. Statement 1 correctly identifies the internal conflicts within the Rajput clan system, which often hampered their collective strength against external aggressors like the Turks. This showcases the internal dynamics of Rajput society and its impact on political stability. Statement 2 accurately describes the Nagara style of temple architecture, highlighting its key features and providing examples from Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar. This demonstrates an understanding of the architectural achievements of the period. Statement 3 correctly points out the religious tolerance of some Rajput rulers, showcasing their patronage of both Hinduism and Jainism, as evident in Vastupala's temple construction.  The options again create plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of each detail.


**3. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest, culminating in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192), marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of Turkish rule in North India.
2.  Prior to the Ghurid conquests, Muslim traders and Sufi preachers fostered interaction between Islamic and Hindu societies, creating pockets of Muslim settlements and influencing some Hindus.
3.  The Chauhan ruler Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at the Second Battle of Tarain was primarily due to the superior organization and tactics of the Ghurid army, rather than solely due to the absence of support from other Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually correct. Statement 1 correctly identifies the significance of the Second Battle of Tarain as a pivotal moment leading to the expansion of Turkish influence in North India. Statement 2 accurately describes the pre-Ghurid interactions between Muslim traders and Sufi preachers with the existing Hindu population, highlighting a process of cultural exchange and the gradual establishment of Muslim communities. Statement 3 accurately assesses Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat, emphasizing the Ghurid army's superior military organization and strategy as a key factor, while acknowledging the role of Rajput disunity, but not solely attributing the defeat to it.  This nuanced understanding is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the event. The option choices successfully test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the various contributing factors.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the cultural and religious developments during the Mughal period:**

1.  The Mughal court, under Akbar's patronage, became a significant center for Persian literature, attracting scholars and poets from Iran and fostering a blend of Persian and Indian literary traditions.
2.  The Bhakti movement continued its influence during the Mughal era, with regional languages like Bengali, Oriya, and Hindi producing significant lyrical poetry based on themes from the Bhagavata Purana and Ramayana.
3.  While Aurangzeb is often associated with religious intolerance, recent research suggests that while he banned singing in his court, he continued to patronize the playing of musical instruments and the study of classical Indian music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are supported by historical evidence. Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's patronage of Persian literature and the consequent flourishing of Persian literary traditions within the Mughal court.  The statement also correctly points out the integration and fusion of Persian and Indian literary styles. Statement 2 correctly highlights the continued influence of the Bhakti movement, with regional languages witnessing a surge in lyrical poetry based on devotional themes. Statement 3 accurately presents a more nuanced view of Aurangzeb's religious policies, acknowledging recent research that suggests his restrictions were primarily focused on vocal music within the court, while other forms of musical expression and scholarship continued under his reign or patronage of his family members. This demonstrates an awareness of updated historical interpretations. The options provide effective distractors, ensuring that the candidate has a deep understanding of each aspect.


These questions are designed to be challenging and require a strong understanding of the provided text's details and broader historical context.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the socio-economic transformations in early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The expansion of cultivation led to a decline in long-distance trade, impacting trade guilds like shrenis and sanghs.
2.  Dharmashastras of the period encouraged extensive travel beyond India proper, fostering greater cultural exchange.
3. The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds were primarily involved in internal trade within India, focusing on regional markets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the growth of small towns and local self-sufficiency in North India led to a decline in long-distance trade, consequently impacting the trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs). These guilds, often composed of members from various castes, lost their former significance due to this shift in trade patterns.  This highlights a crucial aspect of early medieval economic history: the transition from a more interconnected, long-distance trade system to a more localized one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dharmashastras, according to the passage, actually imposed bans on travel beyond certain geographical boundaries (where munja grass did not grow or black gazelle did not roam) and sea travel, ostensibly to discourage the spread of heretical religious ideas. While Indian merchants and others did travel, these bans contradict the statement's assertion of encouragement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds are described as being active in overseas trade with Southeast Asia and other foreign countries, engaging in both wholesale and retail commerce.  Their activities extended far beyond internal trade within India. This demonstrates the reach and influence of Indian mercantile groups during this period and their role in international trade networks.


**2. With reference to the maritime trade and cultural exchanges of early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Tamralipti (Tamluk) served as a major port for trade with Southeast Asia, facilitating the spread of Indian culture.
2. The Chinese primarily imported spices, ivory, and glassware directly from Africa and West Asia, bypassing Indian ports.
3. Rajendra I's naval expedition aimed to secure trade routes to China by suppressing local interference in Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly identifies Tamralipti as the chief Indian port for voyages to Java, Sumatra, and other Southeast Asian destinations.  This underscores the importance of Bengal in India's maritime trade and the role of this port in the dissemination of Indian culture, religion, and technology to the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While China did import the mentioned goods, the text emphasizes that India and Southeast Asia served as crucial staging points for trade between China, West Asia, and Africa.  Indian traders actively participated in this complex network, facilitating the flow of goods between these regions. This highlights the central role of India in the Indian Ocean trade system.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Rajendra I's naval expedition against Malaya and neighboring countries as a direct response to their disruption of trade with China.  This demonstrates the Chola dynasty's proactive approach to safeguarding its maritime trade interests and highlights the strategic importance of these trade routes.


**3. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajput rulers primarily focused on internal conflicts and territorial expansion, neglecting the emerging Turkish threat in the Northwest.
2. The rise of the Ghaznavids marked a significant shift in the political landscape, leading to increased raids into the Gangetic valley.
3.  The Samanids, despite their military strength, were unable to effectively counter the incursions of non-Muslim Turkish tribes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights the political fragmentation and internal conflicts among Rajput states during the Gurjara-Pratihara empire's decline.  This internal strife diverted their attention from the growing power of the Turkish states in the Northwest, which would later pose a major threat.  This illustrates a crucial factor in the success of early Turkish invasions: the lack of unified resistance from existing Indian powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The rise of the Ghaznavids, following the weakening of the Samanids, directly led to a series of raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana.  Mahmud of Ghazni's numerous expeditions are cited as evidence of this increased aggression, marking a turning point in the history of North India.  This underlines the impact of external forces on the region's political stability.

Statement 3 is correct. The Samanids, while ruling a substantial territory, faced continuous struggles against the non-Muslim Turkish tribes on their borders.  The passage explicitly mentions these conflicts and the emergence of the Ghazi, a type of soldier-missionary who played a key role in the Samanids’ defense.  This showcases the challenges faced by even powerful empires in containing nomadic incursions.


**4. With reference to the cultural and religious interactions during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi saints, while primarily targeting Muslim settlers, influenced some Hindus, initiating a process of religious interaction.
2.  Sikandar Lodi's reign witnessed a decline in cultural rapprochement between Hindus and Muslims, marked by increased religious intolerance.
3. Zain-ul-Abidin's policies in Kashmir promoted religious tolerance, undoing the persecution of Hindus under his predecessor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that Sufi preachers, while primarily focusing on Muslim communities, also influenced some Hindus, thus initiating a process of interaction between Islam and Hindu society. This highlights the subtle yet significant ways in which religious ideas and practices could blend and influence each other.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage portrays Sikandar Lodi's reign as a period of cultural rapprochement, not decline.  He is credited with promoting Persian learning among Hindus, translating Sanskrit works into Persian, and appointing Hindus to administrative positions. This contrasts sharply with the statement's claim of increased religious intolerance.


Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly describes Zain-ul-Abidin's reign as a period of religious tolerance in Kashmir.  He reversed the policies of his predecessor, Sikandar Shah, which had involved the persecution of Hindus and the destruction of temples. This showcases a ruler actively promoting religious harmony and undoing earlier acts of religious oppression.


**5.  With reference to the economic conditions and social structures of early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The term 'feudal' accurately describes the socio-economic structure of early medieval India, mirroring European feudalism.
2. The expansion of cultivation and the rise of powerful local chiefs (Samanta, etc.) led to increased burdens on the common people.
3. The caste system remained largely static, with minimal changes in the relative positions of various castes during this period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly cautions against equating the socio-economic structure of early medieval India with European feudalism. While there were similarities in the dominance of a landowning class, key features of European feudalism like vassalage and manorial systems were absent in India.  This points to the importance of avoiding simplistic analogies when comparing historical systems across different regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly links the expansion of cultivation and the rise of local chiefs to increased burdens on the common people.  This includes increased taxation, forced labor (vishti), and the appropriation of resources by powerful individuals.  This highlights the social and economic consequences of the changing power dynamics.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text describes significant changes within the caste system, such as the rise of the Rajputs and the strengthening of the Brahmanical position.  The Brahman-Rajput alliance and the processes of "Rajputization" demonstrate the dynamic nature of the caste system and its adaptation to evolving socio-political realities.  This underscores the complexities of social stratification in early medieval India and the need to move beyond static representations.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and formal worship, rejecting the concept of a loving bond between God and the devotee.
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, vehemently opposed the caste system and advocated for social reforms like allowing widow remarriage.
3.  The Tantric movement, prevalent in North India, was exclusively open to the upper castes, maintaining strict adherence to traditional hierarchical structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, in contrast to its depiction,  rejected austere practices and emphasized a loving, personal relationship between the devotee and God (Siva or Vishnu).  It promoted devotion and accessibility to all castes, significantly contrasting with the rigidity of earlier religious practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and his nephew Channabasava, actively challenged the entrenched caste system and promoted social reforms, including the rejection of traditional rituals and practices, as well as advocating for widow remarriage and opposing child marriage.  This was a significant departure from the prevailing social norms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Tantric movement in North India, unlike the assertion, was explicitly open to all castes, irrespective of social standing. This open inclusivity was a key feature differentiating it from traditional Brahmanical Hinduism and contributed to its widespread appeal among various social groups.  The statement misrepresents the inclusive nature of the movement.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a significant example of magnificent Jain architecture built during the reign of the Chalukya rulers of Gujarat.
2. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, depicting a Jain saint, was erected during the ninth and tenth centuries, reflecting the high point of Jainism in South India.
3.  The Paramara rulers of Malwa actively persecuted Jainism, leading to a decline in its popularity in the region during the medieval period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu stands as a testament to the patronage of Jainism under the Chalukya rulers of Gujarat.  Its exquisite architecture reflects the flourishing of Jain art and religious practices during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, a remarkable feat of sculpture, was indeed erected during the ninth and tenth centuries, a period which represents the zenith of Jainism’s influence in South India.  The scale and artistry of the statue highlight the religious and artistic achievements of the era.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Paramara rulers of Malwa, contrary to the statement, actively *patronized* Jainism, not persecuted it.  They commissioned the construction of numerous large images of Jain saints and Mahavira, further solidifying the religious importance of Jainism in the region.  The statement falsely portrays the rulers' attitude towards Jainism.


**3. With reference to the political and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth of Tantrism in North India and the Bhakti movement in South India both contributed to the weakening of the Brahmanical social order by challenging caste distinctions.
2.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, while intellectually challenging Buddhism and Jainism, had limited impact on the broader masses due to its emphasis on knowledge rather than devotion.
3. Ramanuja's philosophy, unlike Sankara's, emphasized the importance of divine grace over knowledge for salvation, making it more accessible to the lower castes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both Tantrism and the Bhakti movement played significant roles in challenging the rigid caste hierarchy of Brahmanical Hinduism. Their inclusive nature and emphasis on devotion over birth-based status created space for social mobility and religious participation for previously marginalized groups.

Statement 2 is correct. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, while a profound philosophical system, primarily appealed to the intellectual elite. Its emphasis on jnana (knowledge) as the path to liberation made it less accessible to the masses compared to Bhakti's emphasis on bhakti (devotion).

Statement 3 is correct. Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, in contrast to Sankara's emphasis on knowledge, emphasized the importance of prapatti (surrender) and divine grace for salvation. This made his philosophy more appealing to the lower castes, who were often excluded from the intellectual pursuit of jnana.  This inclusive approach broadened the reach of his teachings.


**4. With reference to the early Turkish invasions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghaznavids’ initial raids into India were primarily motivated by a desire to spread Islam and convert the local population.
2. The Rajput rulers consistently failed to offer any resistance against the Ghaznavid raids, leading to the rapid collapse of their kingdoms.
3. Mahmud of Ghazni’s raids were characterized by extensive plunder of temples and towns, enriching the Ghaznavid treasury and enabling further military campaigns.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahmud of Ghazni was a Muslim ruler, his raids were primarily motivated by plunder and the acquisition of wealth, not a focused mission of religious conversion.  The acquisition of wealth was a key factor in his ability to continue military campaigns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajput rulers did, in fact, offer significant resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's raids, although they were not always successful.  Their resistance slowed, but did not prevent, the Ghaznavid incursions.

Statement 3 is correct. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were indeed characterized by the extensive plunder of temples and towns, generating immense wealth that funded his military endeavors and consolidated his power. This plundering is a significant aspect of his reign in Indian history.


**5.  With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue reforms were largely based on accurate land measurement and a fair assessment of the produce, leading to greater agricultural prosperity.
2.  Sher Shah Suri was a staunch religious bigot who actively persecuted Hindus and implemented discriminatory policies against them.
3. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms included the establishment of a new city on the bank of the Yamuna near Delhi, the remains of which include the Purana Qila.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue reforms were indeed a significant aspect of his reign, characterized by accurate land measurement and a relatively fair assessment of agricultural produce. This led to greater agricultural productivity and a more stable revenue system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri was a Muslim ruler, he didn't actively persecute Hindus.  His policies, though not overtly liberal by modern standards, were not marked by widespread religious persecution. The continuation of the jizya tax was a common practice of the time and doesn't necessarily indicate religious bigotry.

Statement 3 is correct. Sher Shah Suri did commission the construction of a new city near Delhi, with the Purana Qila (Old Fort) being a significant surviving structure from that era.  This reflects his focus on infrastructure development and administrative reorganization.


**6.  With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's early reign was marked by significant challenges, including ongoing conflicts with Afghan rebels and the need to consolidate his control over the empire.
2.  Bairam Khan, Akbar's regent, was a staunchly orthodox Muslim who opposed Akbar's later attempts at religious syncretism.
3. The Battle of Panipat (1556) saw Akbar's forces decisively defeat Hemu, consolidating Mughal power in North India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's early reign was indeed fraught with challenges, including the continued resistance from Afghan forces and the need to establish his authority over the vast territories of the Mughal Empire. This period of consolidation was crucial to the long-term success of his rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bairam Khan was a devout Muslim, he is not described in the source as being opposed to Akbar's later religious policies.  In fact, Bairam Khan is generally seen as a relatively tolerant figure himself.

Statement 3 is correct. The Battle of Panipat (1556) was a pivotal moment in the early Mughal period, resulting in a decisive Mughal victory over Hemu and securing their control over North India. This battle is a key turning point in the consolidation of Mughal power.


**7. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and other discriminatory practices demonstrated his commitment to religious tolerance and equality.
2. The Ibadat Khana, established by Akbar, was initially exclusively for Muslim theologians but later opened to representatives of various faiths, fostering religious discussions.
3. Akbar's "Mazhar" declaration asserted his right to interpret religious texts and issue new orders based on his understanding of religious and political benefit, regardless of the opinions of religious scholars.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims) and other discriminatory practices reflects his commitment to fostering religious harmony and creating a more inclusive society within his empire. This was a significant step in promoting religious tolerance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ibadat Khana, initially a gathering for Muslim theologians, was later expanded to include representatives from various religious traditions, leading to significant interfaith discussions and debates. This demonstrates Akbar's attempt to foster religious understanding.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar's "Mazhar" declaration did assert his authority in interpreting religious texts and issuing new rules when discrepancies existed among religious scholars. This move reflected his understanding of the need for political stability and order, and his belief in his ability to make decisions for the betterment of his empire, even in religious matters.


**8. With reference to the Bahmani kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a significant figure in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented administrative reforms including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2. The Bahmani kingdom remained a unified and stable entity throughout its existence, playing a major role in the political landscape of the Deccan.
3. Mahmud Gawan, despite his reforms, failed to resolve the internal strife between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afghans) within the Bahmani nobility.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan did indeed implement significant administrative reforms, including the division of the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), which aimed at streamlining governance and improving efficiency. This was a crucial step in managing the vast kingdom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bahmani kingdom, despite its initial strength, eventually fragmented into five successor states due to persistent internal conflicts and power struggles among its nobility.  The kingdom's decline was caused by internal strife and not external conflict.

Statement 3 is correct. While Mahmud Gawan implemented policies aimed at conciliation, he could not entirely resolve the deep-seated tensions and power struggles between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afghans) within the Bahmani nobility. These internal divisions ultimately contributed to the kingdom's disintegration.


**9. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The succession of Krishna Deva Raya marked the beginning of the Tuluva dynasty and a period of renewed strength and expansion for the Vijayanagara Empire.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign was characterized by complete religious tolerance, with no persecution of any religious group within the empire.
3. The Battle of Talikota (1565) marked the end of the Vijayanagara Empire, although the kingdom continued to exist in a diminished form for some time afterward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Krishna Deva Raya's accession did indeed usher in the Tuluva dynasty and a period of resurgence for the Vijayanagara Empire. His reign is considered a golden age in Vijayanagara history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya is generally regarded as tolerant, there’s no evidence suggesting *complete* religious tolerance.  Religious tolerance in the empire was mostly due to the policy of the ruler and not necessarily the religious harmony of the kingdom.

Statement 3 is correct. The Battle of Talikota (1565) is widely considered a turning point that marked the effective end of the Vijayanagara Empire as a major power, although some remnants of the kingdom persisted for a while longer.  The battle was a decisive defeat that significantly weakened the empire.

1. The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley were consistently successful, leading to the annexation of Assam into the Bengal Sultanate.
2. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign was marked by a policy of religious tolerance and the appointment of Hindus to high administrative positions.
3. The Ahom kingdom in Assam, under the rule of Swarga Narayana, successfully resisted the incursions of the Bengal Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley were not consistently successful. While there were some periods of expansion, the Ahom kingdom in Assam successfully resisted many of the Sultanate's attempts at conquest.  The statement misrepresents the results of these attempts.

Statement 2 is correct. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is indeed noted for its relatively tolerant policies and the appointment of Hindus to significant administrative positions, reflecting a degree of religious harmony.  This relatively tolerant policy was a feature of his reign.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ahom kingdom under Swarga Narayana (Suhungmung) was indeed successful in repelling the incursions of the Bengal Sultanate, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Ahom kingdom.  The statement correctly reflects the military success of the Ahom kingdom.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempt to recover Mudkal and Bankapur from the Bahmani Sultans resulted in a decisive Vijayanagara victory.
2.  Nuniz's account suggests that the Vijayanagara Empire received regular tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim.
3.  Nicolo Conti's account describes Vijayanagara as a vast city with a large army, exceeding the power of other Indian kings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Deva Raya I attempted to regain Mudkal and Bankapur, the battles resulted in a stalemate, not a decisive Vijayanagara victory. The existing frontiers remained unchanged. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Nuniz's account mentions tribute from various kingdoms, but the regularity and extent of tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim are questionable. It's more likely that these were diplomatic gifts or embassies rather than consistent tribute. Statement 3 is correct. Nicolo Conti's account provides a vivid description of Vijayanagara's size, military strength, and the king's power relative to other Indian rulers of his time, reflecting the empire's dominance in the 15th century.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring careful evaluation of historical accounts.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

The text specifically mentions the completion of the Brihadisvara Temple at Tanjore in 1010 during Rajaraja I's reign. Statement 3 is correct. The Chola naval expeditions against Srivijaya were motivated by a desire to expand trade with China and remove obstacles for Indian traders, as the passage indicates.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account details various aspects of life, it doesn't suggest widespread poverty or stagnation. It reveals a vibrant urban economy and trade. Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the growth of towns and trade under improved communication and currency. Statement 3 is incorrect. While there were price fluctuations, the text doesn't support a claim of a substantial *increase* in food grain prices due to agricultural expansion.  The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze historical accounts and understand the complexities of economic life during the Delhi Sultanate, requiring careful evaluation of source material and avoiding generalizations.


**7. With reference to the Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

The inclusion of an inaccurate statement tests analytical skills and a deeper understanding of the historical context.

**10. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The 'amil' was responsible for the overall administration of a province.
2. Villages within the Delhi Sultanate were typically grouped into units of 100 to 84 households.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 'amil' was primarily responsible for revenue collection at the pargana level, not the overall provincial administration.  Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the grouping of villages into units of 100 to 84 households as a basis for pargana administration. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that the harsh aspects of the muqti system were *relaxed* under Firuz Tughlaq, not abolished.  The question tests knowledge of the Delhi Sultanate's administrative structure at the village and pargana levels, requiring precise understanding of the roles of different officials. The inclusion of plausible distractors tests analytical skills and the ability to recall specific details.


**1. With reference to the Rajput period in Indian history, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vastupala, a minister of the Chalukya ruler Bhima in Gujarat, is renowned for constructing a magnificent Jain temple at Mount Abu and for his patronage of scholars and literature.
2.  Apabhramsha and Prakrit, regional languages of the time, saw significant literary contributions, most notably from Hemachandra, a scholar who wrote in both Sanskrit and Apabhramsha.
3.  The revival of Brahmanism led to the decline of Sanskrit as a dominant language amongst the upper classes, with Apabhramsha and Prakrit gaining prominence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Vastupala, a prominent minister during the Chalukya reign in Gujarat, is well-documented for his contributions to architecture (the Jain temple at Mount Abu) and his patronage of learning and literature.  His role as a significant figure in the cultural landscape of the period is widely accepted by historians.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Rajput period witnessed a flourishing of literature in Apabhramsha and Prakrit, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the region. Hemachandra's contributions are particularly significant, showcasing the continued vitality of these vernacular languages alongside Sanskrit.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The revival of Brahmanism did indeed lead to the increased use of Sanskrit among the upper classes. However, this did not result in the *decline* of Sanskrit, but rather a shift in its relative dominance compared to Apabhramsha and Prakrit.  These vernacular languages continued to be used and produced literature, coexisting with Sanskrit, not being supplanted completely.  The statement incorrectly portrays a complete replacement instead of a complex linguistic shift.

(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Alauddin Ghurid's destruction of Ghazni is a well-established historical event, and the title "jahan-soz" accurately reflects the scale of his actions and its impact on the political landscape.  This act of revenge and consolidation of power is a key event in understanding the Ghurid rise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a victory for Prithviraj Chauhan, but it was not a decisive victory that permanently halted the Ghurid advance.  The Ghurids regrouped and returned the following year.  The statement oversimplifies a complex military engagement.

Statement 3 is correct. The second battle of Tarain (1192) represents a critical juncture in Indian history, marking the beginning of the widespread Turkish influence and conquest in North India.  This battle fundamentally altered the political power dynamics of the region.


**3. With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's relocation of the capital to Daulatabad is a well-known and controversial aspect of his reign.  While the intention was to improve control over the Deccan, the logistical challenges and the resistance from the population led to its failure.  This event highlights his ambitious but often poorly executed policies.

Statement 2 is also correct. The introduction of token currency was indeed a bold experiment, driven by a shortage of silver. However, the lack of effective measures to prevent counterfeiting led to its devaluation and ultimate failure.  This episode demonstrates his willingness to adopt innovative but ultimately flawed economic policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's military engagements with the Mongols were not entirely unsuccessful. He did achieve some victories and temporarily extended Delhi Sultanate's influence beyond the Indus.  The statement overstates the extent of his failures against the Mongols.


**4. With reference to the social and economic conditions during the period between the 8th and 12th centuries in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of the Rajputs involved a complex process of social mobility and the legitimization of power, with some clans tracing their lineage to ancient Kshatriya families while others had mixed origins.

3.  The growth of a feudal-like structure during this period significantly burdened the common people, exacerbated by frequent famines and wars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the complex social dynamics of Rajput emergence.  Their origins were multifaceted, with some claiming ancient Kshatriya lineage while others arose through social mobility and the integration of various groups. The process of "Rajputization" involved both genealogical claims and the consolidation of political and economic power.

Statement 2 correctly describes the revenue system. While the basic land revenue rate was often one-sixth of the produce, numerous additional taxes and cesses were levied, alongside forced labor.  The grant of land often included control over the peasant population, creating a system of dependence.

Statement 3 is also accurate. The emergence of a hierarchical social structure with powerful regional chiefs placed significant burdens on the common people.  Frequent famines and wars further compounded the hardships faced by the peasantry, highlighting the instability and challenges of the period.


**5. With reference to the religious policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's removal of the jizya tax (a poll tax on non-Muslims) and pilgrim tax demonstrated his commitment to religious tolerance and the principle of equal treatment for all his subjects, regardless of faith. This was a significant policy shift.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ibadat Khana was indeed a forum for interfaith dialogue, bringing together scholars from various religious traditions.  While intended to foster understanding, it also led to controversies and disagreements among orthodox theologians.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Akbar's "Mazhar" declaration, while asserting his authority in matters of religious interpretation, was not widely accepted by orthodox theologians.  It was a controversial move that further strained his relationship with the conservative religious establishment.  The statement misrepresents the reaction to this declaration.


**6. With reference to the later Mughal Empire and the regional uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily peasant revolts with agrarian roots, often triggered by issues related to land revenue collection.
2. The Satnami revolt, involving peasants, artisans, and lower-caste people, was characterized by its rejection of caste distinctions and its unified resistance against Mughal authority.
3.  The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were largely tribal conflicts, fuelled by economic hardship and a desire for regional autonomy, with religious factors playing a relatively minor role.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Jat uprisings were rooted in agrarian issues and peasant grievances, often stemming from unfair land revenue practices and the harsh treatment of cultivators by Mughal authorities.  These uprisings highlighted the tensions between the peasantry and the state.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Satnami revolt was distinctive in its transcendence of caste barriers, uniting diverse groups in a common struggle against the Mughal state.  Its social and religious aspects contributed to its significant impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Afghan uprisings had tribal dimensions, religious and political factors played a more substantial role than the statement suggests.  The desire for regional autonomy and the religious fervor associated with movements like the Raushanai movement contributed significantly to the intensity and longevity of these uprisings.  The statement underplays the significance of religious and political motivations.


**7.  With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The provincial administration of the Delhi Sultanate was headed by governors known as 'Muqtis', who were responsible for collecting revenue and maintaining law and order.
2. The 'Iqta' system, under which land was assigned to military commanders in lieu of salaries, played a crucial role in the Sultanate's military organization and revenue collection.
3. The village administration under the Delhi Sultanate was highly centralized, with significant interference from the Sultanate authorities in village affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 1 is correct.  The Muqtis were indeed the key administrative figures at the provincial level, responsible for both revenue collection and maintaining peace and order within their assigned territories.  Their role was central to the Sultanate's control over its vast domains.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Iqta system was a cornerstone of the Delhi Sultanate's military and revenue system.  It provided a means of compensating military commanders and simultaneously generating revenue for the state.  Understanding the Iqta system is crucial for comprehending the Sultanate's functioning.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The village administration under the Delhi Sultanate was not highly centralized. While the Sultanate collected revenue, it generally left village administration largely untouched, interfering only when necessary, primarily for tax collection.  The statement misrepresents the level of Sultanate involvement in village-level governance.  The statement presents a misleading picture of the Sultanate's administrative reach at the village level.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history and society.


**1. With reference to the social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct entity during this period, initially encompassing individuals from diverse varna backgrounds who served in royal establishments.
2.  The varna system remained strictly rigid, with minimal social mobility between different varna groups.
3.  The absorption of Buddhists, Jains, and various tribal groups into the Hindu fold led to the creation of numerous new castes and sub-castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Kayastha caste originated from a diverse group of people working in royal establishments, gradually solidifying into a distinct caste. This demonstrates social fluidity within the medieval Indian social structure, challenging the notion of a completely rigid varna system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage directly contradicts this statement, noting that the caste system wasn't as rigid as often believed. Individuals and groups could rise or fall in the varna hierarchy, and the classification of new castes presented challenges.  This highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of the caste system, allowing for social mobility.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the assimilation of Buddhists, Jains, and indigenous tribes into the Hindu fold, resulting in the formation of new castes and sub-castes. This underscores the adaptive and inclusive nature of Hinduism during this period, accommodating diverse populations and practices.  The integration often involved the incorporation of existing customs and deities into the broader Hindu framework.


**2. With reference to the social stratification and practices in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dalit community's social standing improved significantly during this period, gaining access to Smarta rituals and land ownership.
2.  Marriages between higher and lower castes were uncommon and heavily frowned upon, yet they occurred, leading to the creation of new occupational castes.
3.  Slavery was prevalent, with individuals often enslaved due to debt, war captivity, or famine, but slaves received relatively better treatment compared to the Antyaja.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage indicates that the position of Dalits, or untouchables, deteriorated during the period.  While Shudras experienced some social elevation, Dalits faced harsher treatment, including segregation and restrictions on land ownership and social interaction.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly explains that while marriages between higher and lower castes were socially unacceptable, they did occur. The terms *anumata* (according to norm) and *prasilata* (against norm) were used to describe such unions, reflecting the social disapproval but acknowledging their existence.  These unions often contributed to the formation of new occupational castes.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage describes the existence of slavery, highlighting various causes such as war, debt, and famine.  It also notes that slaves were generally treated better than the Antyaja (untouchables), suggesting a hierarchy of social degradation even within the enslaved population.  This reflects the complex social stratification of medieval India.


**3. With reference to the condition of women in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Women were generally considered mentally inferior and their primary duty was unquestioning obedience to their husbands.
2.  The marriageable age for girls was raised during this period, providing them with more opportunities for education.
3.  While upper-class women lived in seclusion, the practice of purdah (veiling) was not universally enforced across all regions and social strata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights the prevailing societal view of women's mental inferiority and their expected subservience to their husbands.  This reflects the patriarchal structure of medieval Indian society.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage states that the marriageable age for girls was *lowered*, not raised, during this period, directly impacting their access to education.  This practice is presented as detrimental to women's educational prospects.

Statement 3 is correct. Although upper-class women often lived in seclusion, the text explicitly notes that purdah (veiling) wasn't uniformly practiced across all regions.  The account of  travelers like Abu Zaid indicates that unveiled women were present in courts, challenging the notion of a universal and absolute enforcement of purdah.


**4. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The village administration remained largely unchanged during the early stages of the Delhi Sultanate, contributing to the quick establishment of Turkish authority in rural areas.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate's economy was characterized by a flourishing urban economy, with major cities like Delhi and Daulatabad showcasing significant commercial activity.
3.  The Sultanate period witnessed the introduction of the spinning wheel and cotton carder's bow, significantly improving textile production alongside the existing skills of Indian craftsmen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that initially, the local administration and revenue collection methods largely remained the same under the Delhi Sultanate. This continuity facilitated a smoother transition of power and helped the Turkish rulers establish their authority in the countryside quickly.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage describes the Delhi Sultanate as having a "flourishing urban economy," highlighting the growth of major cities such as Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, and others. These cities were centers of trade, commerce, and various crafts.  Ibn Battuta's account supports this observation.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text mentions the introduction or popularization of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow during the Sultanate period.  These technological advancements, combined with the existing skills of Indian craftsmen, contributed to improvements in textile production.  The high quality of Indian textiles is further emphasized in the text.

1.  The Mughal Empire had a clear and established tradition of succession, usually following primogeniture.
2.  The Jat uprisings were primarily driven by religious motivations, with the Jats actively challenging Mughal religious policies.
3.  The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were largely tribal in nature, but also involved the ambition of establishing an independent Afghan state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there was *no clear tradition of succession* among the Mughals or Timurids.  The right of nomination existed but was not consistently followed, leading to frequent succession struggles among the princes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jat uprisings, while having religious overtones, were primarily rooted in economic and agrarian issues related to land revenue collection and zamindari rights.  The passage highlights the Jat's peasant cultivator background and the conflict over land revenue as the primary causes.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage describes the Afghan uprisings as having a tribal character, but also emphasizes the underlying aspiration for a separate Afghan state.  The ambition of establishing independence is clearly mentioned as a significant factor driving these uprisings.  The Raushanai movement provided an added ideological impetus.


**6. With reference to the cultural and religious developments during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan of Navadwipa asserted the exclusive right of Brahmans to read scriptures and preach, reflecting a resurgence of orthodox Hindu views.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya.
3.  The influence of orthodox thinkers and preachers during this period was widespread, shaping the religious landscape across all segments of society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights Raghunandan's assertion of Brahmanical privileges, emphasizing their exclusive right to interpret scriptures and preach. This reflects a conservative and orthodox stance within Hinduism.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's liberal policies and his advocacy for the re-imposition of jizya and a stricter approach towards Hindus.  This represents a conservative and revivalist movement within Islam.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the influence of orthodox thinkers was *limited*, confined to specific circles, unlike the broader appeal of liberal thinkers.  Their influence was primarily among the wealthy and powerful, not across all societal segments.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the Vijayanagara Empire's expansion to include territories as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, demonstrated by the tribute they received.
2.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign was characterized by a policy of religious tolerance, incorporating Hindus into the administration on a large scale.
3.  The Bahmani Kingdom's expansion reached its zenith under Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership, encompassing significant territorial gains in the east and west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions tributary relationships with some regions, the extent of Vijayanagara's control over distant places like Pegu and Tenasserim is questionable.  The tribute mentioned might have been sporadic gifts or diplomatic gestures rather than consistent subjugation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage highlights Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of including Hindus in the administration, particularly in revenue matters.  This reflects a degree of religious tolerance and pragmatism in governance.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text attributes the Bahmani Kingdom's territorial expansion to Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership, noting significant conquests in the east and west, including the important coastal ports.  His administration also focused on internal reforms and economic growth.


**8. With reference to the political and economic aspects of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pratihara Empire's decline was partly due to the loss of Gujarat, a crucial region for overseas trade and access to the sea.
2.  The Rashtrakuta Empire, under rulers like Govinda III and Amoghavarsha, engaged in extensive military campaigns, expanding their territory significantly and establishing dominance over much of the Deccan.
3.  Krishna III's defeat of the Chola king, Parantaka I, led to the annexation of the northern part of the Chola empire and marked the peak of the Rashtrakuta Empire's power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly links the Pratihara Empire's weakening to the loss of Gujarat, which controlled vital sea routes and overseas trade.  This loss significantly impacted the empire's economic strength and strategic position.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the Rashtrakuta Empire under Govinda III and Amoghavarsha as a period of significant military expansion and consolidation of power in the Deccan.  Govinda III's campaigns are highlighted, and Amoghavarsha's long reign, despite focusing on other aspects, maintained the empire's territorial reach.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text correctly identifies Krishna III's victory over Parantaka I and the subsequent annexation of Chola territories as a major achievement, highlighting it as a period of considerable Rashtrakuta power before their eventual decline.

1. The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature.
2. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign saw the appointment of several Hindus to high offices, including the position of wazir, demonstrating a policy of religious tolerance.
3. Alauddin Hussain Shah's military campaigns successfully extended the Bengal Sultanate's control over the entire Brahmaputra valley, including modern-day Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage specifically identifies Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign as a crucial period for the development of the Bengali language, mentioning the flourishing of Bengali writers during his rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights Alauddin Hussain Shah's appointment of Hindus to various important positions, including the wazir, demonstrating a policy of religious inclusivity and tolerance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Alauddin Hussain Shah did expand the Bengal Sultanate's influence, the passage indicates that his conquest of the Brahmaputra valley was incomplete and limited.  The Ahom kingdom, in particular, remained a significant independent power in the region.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the economic conditions and social structures in medieval India:**

1.  The wages of artisans and unskilled laborers during the medieval period were relatively high, ensuring a comfortable standard of living.
2.  Medieval Indian society was characterized by significant inequalities, particularly pronounced in urban areas between the Muslim nobility and the general populace.
3.  The smriti texts of the medieval period emphasized the Brahman's high social status and prescribed specific duties and occupations for different varnas, maintaining a rigid social hierarchy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the wages of artisans and laborers were quite low, resulting in difficult living conditions, particularly in urban areas.  This reflects the vast economic disparities of the time.

Statement 2 is correct. The text emphasizes the considerable inequalities prevalent in medieval Indian society, particularly highlighting the contrast between the opulent lifestyles of the Muslim nobility and the hardships faced by the majority of the population in both urban and rural areas.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage describes how the smriti texts maintained the high position of Brahmans, and reiterated the duties and occupations designated for each varna. While there was some social mobility, the overarching structure remained hierarchical, based on the varna system.  However, the degree of rigidity is debated in the text.

Note that due to the length and complexity of the provided text, it's impossible to create a truly comprehensive set of questions within the token limit. The questions below cover significant aspects and aim for a balanced difficulty level.


**1. With reference to the socio-political landscape of Bengal during the late medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) is considered a pivotal period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's administration notably included Hindus in high offices, demonstrating a relatively liberal policy.
3. The Ahom kingdom, initially a Mongoloid tribe from Burma, successfully resisted several attempts by the Bengal Sultans to conquer their territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Bengal's history during the specified period.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign did indeed foster the growth of Bengali language and literature, marking a significant cultural development. His inclusion of Hindus in high administrative positions, such as wazir and chief physician, is well-documented, highlighting a departure from strictly sectarian policies.  Finally, the Ahom kingdom's consistent resistance against the Bengal Sultans, despite several military campaigns, is a crucial element in understanding the power dynamics of the region.  The Ahoms, initially a non-Indian tribe, successfully integrated into and significantly impacted the region's culture and politics.  There is no evidence to contradict these historical facts.


**2. With reference to the political and military strategies of the Bengal Sultans, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bengal Sultans' repeated attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley were consistently thwarted by the Ahoms.
2. The Karatoya river served as a fluctuating border between Bengal and Kamata (Kamrup).
3.  The annexation of Kamata to Bengal under Alauddin Hussain Shah was achieved through a coordinated effort with the Ahoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical record.  The persistent resistance of the Ahoms against the Bengal Sultans' incursions into the Brahmaputra valley is well-established.  The Karatoya river acted as a shifting boundary between Bengal and Kamata, subject to territorial gains and losses by both sides throughout the period. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Ahoms did participate in military actions related to the conflict, their collaboration with Alauddin Hussain Shah in the conquest of Kamata is not definitively supported by historical accounts. The conflict was more complex than a simple alliance.


**3. With reference to the reign of Ahmad Shah I (Gujarat Sultanate), consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital of the Gujarat Sultanate from Patan to Ahmedabad.
2.  His architectural style, influenced by Jain traditions, featured slender turrets and ornate stone carving.
3. His reign was marked by complete religious tolerance, with no instances of persecution against Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are historically accurate. Ahmad Shah I's relocation of the capital to Ahmedabad and his distinctive architectural style, blending Islamic and Jain elements, are well-documented.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Ahmad Shah I did employ Hindus in his administration, his actions towards Hindu religious sites, such as the destruction of temples in Sidhpur, demonstrate a clear lack of complete religious tolerance.  His policies were complex and not consistently tolerant.


**4. With reference to the economic and social conditions of India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade within India led to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in North India.
2.  The Dharamshastras of this period imposed a ban on sea travel, significantly impacting overseas trade.
3.  Indian merchants played a crucial role in the trade between China, Southeast Asia, and West Asia, utilizing Indian shipyards and maritime expertise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are supported by historical evidence. The shift away from long-distance trade did indeed impact the trade guilds, while the significant role of Indian merchants in the broader Indian Ocean trade network is well-documented.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate. While some Dharamshastras might have expressed reservations about certain types of travel, there's no evidence of a complete ban on sea travel that significantly impacted overseas trade.  The restrictions were likely more nuanced and didn't entirely halt India's maritime activities.  The vibrant overseas trade continued throughout this period.


**5. With reference to the religious and social movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement in South India emphasized love and devotion as the path to salvation, transcending caste distinctions.
2.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava, rejected the caste system and advocated for social reforms like widow remarriage.
3.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy primarily focused on the path of bhakti as the sole means of achieving salvation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of the Bhakti and Lingayat movements respectively. The Bhakti saints emphasized devotion and love for God, making it accessible across castes, and the Lingayat movement actively challenged the rigid caste system.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Sankara didn't reject bhakti, his Advaita Vedanta emphasized *jnana* (knowledge) as a crucial element in the path to salvation, alongside bhakti.  His philosophy was more complex than solely focusing on bhakti.


**6. With reference to the political developments in North India during the early Turkish conquests, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Tarain (1192) marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of Turkish rule.
2.  Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at Tarain was primarily due to his negligence and lack of preparation for the battle.
3. Jaichandra, the ruler of Kanauj, actively supported Prithviraj Chauhan in the Battle of Tarain.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The second Battle of Tarain undeniably shifted the balance of power, paving the way for Turkish dominance in North India.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. While Prithviraj Chauhan did appeal for support and received some assistance, his defeat was not solely due to negligence.  The superior military tactics and organization of the Ghurid army played a more significant role. Moreover, Jaichandra's refusal to aid Prithviraj Chauhan is historically documented, stemming from pre-existing rivalry between their kingdoms rather than the abduction legend often cited.


**7.  With reference to the Mughal land revenue system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Zabti system, associated with Raja Todar Mal, involved a detailed measurement of land and assessment based on average produce and prices.
2.  The Batai system involved a fixed proportion of the produce being shared between the peasant and the state.
3. The Rasag system was a completely new system introduced by Akbar, replacing all existing methods of assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Zabti and Batai systems respectively. The Zabti system, a significant refinement of earlier methods, involved precise land measurement and assessment based on average yields and prices.  The Batai system involved a fixed crop-sharing arrangement.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Rasag system wasn't a completely new invention but rather a method of assessment based on past practices and estimation.  It co-existed with other methods, rather than replacing them entirely.  Akbar's land revenue system involved a range of approaches adapted to local conditions.


**8. With reference to the Mansabdari system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mansabdari system was a unique system with no exact parallel outside India.
2.  The 'zar' rank indicated the number of cavalrymen a Mansabdar was required to maintain.
3. The Dagh system involved branding horses with imperial marks to ensure quality control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Mansabdari system was indeed unique to the Mughal empire. The Dagh system, involving the branding of horses, was a crucial part of the system for maintaining the quality and standardization of the cavalry.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 'zar' rank indicated the personal status and salary of the Mansabdar, while the 'sawar' rank specified the number of cavalrymen he had to maintain.  The two components were distinct aspects of the Mansab.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about the development of regional languages in medieval India:**

1. The rise of regional languages was partly facilitated by a decline in the prestige of Sanskrit and Brahmins.
2. Bhakti saints played a significant role in shaping regional languages for literary purposes.
3.  The use of regional languages for administrative purposes was limited to post-Turkish rule in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit and Brahmins during the medieval period created space for the rise of regional languages.  The growing popularity of vernacular languages among the masses, coupled with the diminished authority of Sanskrit as the sole language of high culture and administration, directly contributed to the flourishing of regional literary traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. Bhakti saints actively employed regional languages in their devotional poetry and teachings, reaching a wider audience and thereby fostering the development and standardization of these languages for literary expression.  Their use of accessible language significantly impacted the growth of these vernaculars.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Persian initially dominated under the Delhi Sultanate, regional languages were used alongside it for administrative purposes in various parts of India even before the arrival of the Turks.  Many pre-Turkish regional kingdoms employed their local languages for administration, illustrating the pre-existing usage of these languages in governance. The subsequent fragmentation of the Delhi Sultanate further solidified the role of regional languages in administration.


**2. With reference to the integration of musical traditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing several Perso-Arabic ragas and is also attributed with the invention of the sitar.
2. The Ragadarpan, a significant work on Indian classical music, was translated into Persian during the reign of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq.
3. The development of distinct musical styles in North and South India was entirely due to the influence of Perso-Arabic modes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Amir Khusrau, a renowned musician and scholar, significantly contributed to the fusion of Indian and Persian musical traditions. He introduced several Perso-Arabic ragas into the Indian musical repertoire.  While he is often associated with the invention of the sitar, concrete historical evidence for this claim remains scarce.  The attribution should therefore be treated with caution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ragadarpan, a crucial text on Indian classical music, underwent translation into Persian during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, showcasing the Sultan's patronage of music and the growing interaction between Persian and Indian musical cultures.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Perso-Arabic modes undoubtedly influenced the development of North Indian music, it’s inaccurate to attribute the differentiation between North and South Indian musical styles solely to this factor.  Pre-existing regional variations and independent musical developments in South India played a significant role in shaping its unique musical traditions.  The interaction was a complex process involving mutual exchange and adaptation rather than complete dominance.


**3. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Rajan" primarily referred to a tribal chief who wielded military authority but not necessarily over a defined geographical area.
2. The early Aryans, primarily pastoral in nature, lacked a sophisticated political structure comparable to a modern state.
3.  The rise of hereditary revenue officers like the "nad gavundas" in the Deccan strengthened the authority of the central rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the understanding of the term "Rajan" in early Indian history. It describes the title as being initially associated with a tribal leader whose power stemmed largely from military prowess and influence within a tribe, rather than a clearly demarcated territorial jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is consistent with historical interpretations of early Aryan society.  Their primarily pastoral lifestyle and social organization didn't readily lend themselves to the complex administrative and territorial structures characteristic of later state formations.  This statement accurately reflects the less developed political organization of early Aryan society compared to later historical periods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The emergence of hereditary revenue officers like the "nad gavundas" actually weakened the central ruler's authority.  These officers, by establishing their own hereditary power base, increasingly challenged the control and influence of the central government over revenue collection and local administration. This development is recognized as a key aspect of the 'feudalization' process in medieval India.


**4.  With reference to the cultural exchanges during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Nusrat Shah of Bengal commissioned translations of the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata into Bengali.
2. Malik Muhammad Jaisi's Padmavat, written in Hindi, allegorically used the attack on Chittor to expound Sufi ideas.
3.  The Mughal court under Akbar saw significant contributions to Persian literature only from Persian scholars who migrated to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Nusrat Shah's patronage of Bengali literature.  His support for the translation of major Sanskrit epics into Bengali is well-documented, highlighting his role in promoting the development of Bengali literature and the integration of different cultural traditions.

Statement 2 accurately describes Malik Muhammad Jaisi's Padmavat. The work cleverly employs the historical context of Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor as a vehicle for exploring Sufi concepts of the relationship between the soul and God, intertwined with elements of Hindu thought.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many Persian scholars who migrated to India enriched Mughal court literature,  Hindus also made significant contributions to the growth of Persian literature during Akbar's reign, demonstrating the cultural exchange and interaction between different communities. This statement ignores the considerable participation of Indian scholars and writers in shaping the literary landscape of the Mughal court.


**5. With reference to the conflicts and uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings were primarily peasant movements with an agrarian background, unrelated to religious factors.
2. The Satnamis, a religious sect, were involved in an armed conflict with the Mughal state, wherein local Hindu Zamindars aided the Mughals.
3. The Afghan uprisings were purely tribal conflicts, devoid of any aspirations for regional independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jat uprisings had strong agrarian roots stemming from land revenue issues and exploitation, religious and caste factors also played a role in mobilizing support and shaping the nature of the conflict.  The Jat identity and social structure influenced their resistance to Mughal authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Satnami rebellion involved a religious group, and local Hindu Zamindars, particularly Rajputs, sided with the Mughal government against the Satnamis, highlighting the complex interplay of religious, social, and political factors in the conflict.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Afghan uprisings, while having a tribal dimension, also reflected a desire for regional autonomy and independence from Mughal rule. The ambition of establishing a separate Afghan state played a significant role in motivating the various uprisings and conflicts.  The desire for self-governance was an underlying factor in the Afghan resistance.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempt to reclaim Mudkal and Bankapur from the Bahmani Sultans resulted in a decisive Vijayanagara victory, significantly altering the existing frontiers.
2.  Nicolo Conti's account describes Vijayanagara as a city with a circumference of sixty miles, possessing ninety thousand men capable of bearing arms.
3.  Abdur Razzaq's account mentions that Deva Raya II controlled three hundred ports, each comparable to Calicut in size, and territories spanning a three-month journey.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Deva Raya I did attempt to recover Mudkal and Bankapur, the battles fought resulted in a stalemate, not a decisive Vijayanagara victory. The existing frontiers remained largely unchanged.  This highlights the complex power dynamics and limitations of even a powerful empire like Vijayanagara.

Statement 2 is correct. Nicolo Conti's account provides a vivid description of Vijayanagara's size and military strength. His assessment of the king's power relative to other Indian rulers underscores Vijayanagara's dominance in the region during the early 15th century.  Such accounts from foreign travellers are crucial primary sources for understanding the medieval Indian context.

Statement 3 is correct. Abdur Razzaq's account, while potentially exaggerating the extent of Deva Raya II's empire, nonetheless reflects the significant size and prosperity of the Vijayanagara kingdom.  The comparison to Calicut, a major port, and the description of extensive territories emphasize the empire's reach and economic power.  The potential exaggeration in such accounts often requires critical analysis and cross-referencing with other historical sources.  The mention of numerous ports highlights the empire’s significant maritime trade and influence.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign saw a significant increase in Hindu participation in the administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership marked the peak of the Bahmani Kingdom's territorial expansion, including conquests along the western coast.
3.  The Bahmani Kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five independent sultanates, including Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar, which continued to influence Deccan politics.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of including Hindus in the administration, especially in revenue management, is a well-documented aspect of his reign. This demonstrates a pragmatic approach to governance, utilizing the existing administrative expertise rather than solely relying on foreign appointees.  This aspect highlights the cultural and administrative complexities of the medieval Deccan.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister was indeed a period of significant territorial expansion for the Bahmani Kingdom.  His military achievements, particularly along the western coast, significantly strengthened the kingdom’s power and control over trade routes. His administrative reforms and patronage of learning further consolidated the kingdom’s strength.

Statement 3 is correct. The disintegration of the Bahmani Kingdom led to the formation of five successor states, and the three mentioned—Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar—were significant players in Deccan politics for centuries. This fragmentation illustrates the cyclical nature of empire building and the inherent challenges in maintaining large, multi-ethnic states in medieval India.


**3. With reference to the political and military structures of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pratihara army was renowned for its superior cavalry, while the Pala army included infantry drawn from diverse regions across India.
2.  The Rashtrakuta administration featured a hierarchical structure with rashrapatis governing provinces, and village administration handled by hereditary headmen.
3.  The vassal chiefs in these empires enjoyed significant autonomy in their internal affairs, while owing loyalty and tribute to the overlord, often involving political marriages to solidify alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states the Pratiharas' renowned cavalry and the Pala army's diverse infantry composition.  This reflects the importance of cavalry in warfare and the diverse recruitment practices of these empires.  The reliance on diverse sources of manpower suggests a complex military organization.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rashtrakuta administrative structure, with its rashrapatis and hereditary village headmen, is accurately described.  This highlights the hierarchical nature of the administration, while simultaneously pointing towards the persistence of traditional village structures. The administrative framework demonstrates a balance between centralized control and local autonomy.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of vassal relationships in these empires accurately portrays the balance between autonomy and subordination.  The practice of political marriages, in particular, is a key feature of medieval Indian political strategy, demonstrating the importance of kinship ties in maintaining stability and loyalty within a larger empire.  The inherent tensions within these relationships often led to conflicts.


**4. With reference to the economic and social conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread poverty among the peasantry despite the wealth of the ruling classes, with limited clothing and footwear being common.
2.  The village economy relied heavily on barter, making it difficult to assess the precise income of the peasantry, although some owner-cultivators (khudkashts) were more prosperous.
3.  The Mughal state’s interventions, such as providing taccavi loans, stimulated agricultural expansion and the adoption of new crops like tobacco and maize during the 17th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Accounts from European travelers consistently highlight the disparity between the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among the peasantry. This observation is supported by descriptions of limited clothing and footwear among the common people.  This disparity underscores the social and economic inequalities of the era.

Statement 2 is correct. The text points to the prevalence of barter in village transactions, making precise income assessment difficult.  However, it also acknowledges the existence of more prosperous owner-cultivators (khudkashts) within the village hierarchy. This illustrates the internal economic stratification within rural communities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mughal state's initiatives, including the provision of taccavi loans, played a role in promoting agricultural expansion and the adoption of new crops. The introduction of tobacco and maize demonstrates the state’s impact on economic development and the adaptability of Indian agriculture.  The integration of new crops into the existing agricultural system underscores the dynamism of the rural economy.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule witnessed the appointment of Hindus to high positions, including his wazir.
2.  The annexation of Kamata to Bengal under Alauddin Hussain Shah resulted in the establishment of an Afghan colony in the region.
3.  Nusrat Shah's attack on the Ahom kingdom in the eastern Brahmaputra valley was successful in expanding Bengal's territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign was marked by a relatively liberal policy towards Hindus, evident in the appointment of Hindus to key administrative positions such as wazir, chief physician, and head of the bodyguard. This demonstrates a departure from strictly sectarian policies and reflects a pragmatic approach to governance.  This fact highlights the Sultanate's complex relationship with the existing Hindu population and its adaptation to local conditions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Following the conquest of Kamata, Alauddin Hussain Shah strategically established an Afghan colony in the region. This action served multiple purposes: consolidating control over newly acquired territory, providing a buffer against potential rebellions, and potentially leveraging Afghan military expertise. This exemplifies the Sultanate's use of military and settlement strategies for political control.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Nusrat Shah's subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom was unsuccessful and resulted in considerable losses for the Bengal forces.  This emphasizes the limitations of the Bengal Sultanate's military power and the strength of the Ahom kingdom. The Ahom kingdom, under Suhungmung (Svarga Narayana), successfully repelled this invasion, demonstrating their military prowess and solidifying their independence.  This points to the regional power dynamics that shaped the political landscape of the time.



**2. With reference to the cultural landscape of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language.
2. The famous Vaishnava saints Rupa and Sanatan held high posts in Alauddin Hussain Shah's administration.
3. The construction of the Puri temple and the Konark Sun Temple occurred under the patronage of the Bengal Sultanate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly identifies Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) as a pivotal period for the development and flourishing of Bengali literature.  The patronage extended to Bengali writers during this era contributed significantly to the language's growth and evolution. This highlights the Sultanate's influence on cultural development beyond purely religious aspects.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Rupa and Sanatan, renowned Vaishnava saints, held prominent positions within Alauddin Hussain Shah's court. One was even his private secretary. This illustrates the Sultan's policy of religious tolerance and the integration of prominent religious figures into the administrative structure.  The inclusion of these figures indicates a nuanced approach to governance that accommodated various religious communities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the text mentions the Puri temple and the Konark Sun Temple, it explicitly attributes their construction to the Ganga dynasty of Orissa, not the Bengal Sultanate.  Attributing these significant architectural achievements to the wrong dynasty demonstrates a lack of awareness of the historical context of these structures and their patrons.  The text also highlights the conflicts between the Bengal Sultanate and the Orissa rulers, further emphasizing this distinction.



**3. With reference to the geopolitical interactions of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to control the Brahmaputra valley resulted in consistent victories against the Ahom kingdom.
2.  The annexation of Chittagong was achieved through military conflict with the Arakan king under the rule of Sultan Hussain Shah.
3.  The Ganga dynasty of Orissa consistently aided the Bengal Sultanate in its conflicts with other regional powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly details the Bengal Sultanate's repeated failures to fully subdue the Ahom kingdom in the Brahmaputra valley.  These repeated defeats underscore the limitations of the Sultanate's military capabilities and the resilience of the Ahom kingdom. This highlights the regional power balances and the limitations of external expansion.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sultan Hussain Shah successfully conquered Chittagong after wresting it from the Arakan king. This reflects the Sultanate's expansionist ambitions and its engagement in military conflicts to extend its territorial control. This expansion showcases the Sultanate’s military successes and its impact on the regional political landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text describes a complex relationship between the Bengal Sultanate and the Ganga dynasty of Orissa, marked by both conflict and occasional raids.  The Ganga dynasty is not portrayed as a consistent ally of the Bengal Sultanate, but rather as a powerful regional entity capable of resisting Bengal's expansionist efforts.  This highlights the dynamic and often adversarial nature of inter-state relations in the region.  The text describes raids by both sides, illustrating the fluctuating balance of power.


**4. With reference to the economic policies of the Gujarat Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Firuz Tughlaq's governorship, Gujarat experienced a period of religious persecution against Hindus.
2.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital from Patan to Ahmedabad and implemented a sizyah tax on Hindus.
3.  Mahmud Begarha's reign witnessed a significant decline in the economic prosperity of Gujarat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that under Firuz Tughlaq's governance, Gujarat saw a period of religious tolerance, with the governor actively encouraging Hindu religious practices. This contradicts the statement's claim of religious persecution.  This highlights the variations in administrative policies across different rulers and periods.

Statement 2 is correct. Ahmad Shah I's reign is noteworthy for the establishment of Ahmedabad as the new capital and the implementation of the sizyah tax on Hindus.  The shift in capital reflects a strategic decision to consolidate power and control, while the introduction of the sizyah tax indicates a change in fiscal policy.  This demonstrates the ruler's administrative and economic reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text does not explicitly detail the extent of economic prosperity under Mahmud Begarha, it describes his long reign (over 50 years) as a period of expansion and consolidation.  This suggests continued economic activity, rather than a significant decline.  The lack of evidence supporting economic decline during Mahmud Begarha’s reign makes this statement inaccurate.  A long and stable reign often indicates economic stability.


**5. With reference to the military organization of the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala infantry included soldiers drawn from diverse regions across India, including Malwa, Khasa, Lata, and Karnataka.
2. The Pratihara kings are known to have possessed the finest cavalry in India, obtained through imports from Central Asia and Arabia.
3. Both the Pala and Pratihara empires relied solely on standing armies, without utilizing feudal levies in their military forces.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that the Pala infantry was composed of soldiers from various regions across India, such as Malwa, Khasa (Assam), Lata (south Gujarat), and Karnataka.  This indicates a diverse and geographically widespread military recruitment strategy. This highlights the empire's ability to draw upon manpower from across a vast territory.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the Pratihara cavalry as the finest in India, attributing this to the import of horses from Central Asia and Arabia. This indicates a focus on cavalry as a core military strength and a reliance on external trade for military resources.  The emphasis on high-quality cavalry demonstrates their military strategy and economic capacity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the text describes the large military forces of both empires, it doesn't state that they solely depended on standing armies.  The text mentions the use of vassal chiefs supplying troops, indicating the utilization of feudal levies alongside regular troops.  The mention of vassal chiefs contributing troops indicates a mixed military structure combining standing armies and feudal levies. This reflects a more complex military organization than the statement suggests.


**1. With reference to the financial administration of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *muqti* was responsible for remitting the revenue balance to the central treasury after meeting administrative expenses.
2.  Financial audits, often involving harsh measures like torture and imprisonment of the *muqti*, were conducted every five years.
3.  Firuz Tughlaq implemented reforms that significantly reduced the harshness associated with revenue collection and audits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the *muqti* (a provincial governor or revenue official) was obligated to send the remaining revenue to the central government after covering expenses. This demonstrates a system of centralized financial control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that auditing occurred "after a couple of years," not every five years.  The frequency of the audits is not precisely specified, but the provided timeframe is shorter than five years. The harsh methods employed during audits are accurately described.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly notes that Firuz Tughlaq eased the harshness associated with these audits, indicating a policy change towards a more lenient approach to revenue collection and accountability. This highlights a shift in administrative practices during his reign.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include statement 2, which is factually inaccurate regarding the frequency of audits. Option (a) is the only option that accurately reflects the information presented in the text.


**2. With reference to the village administration under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Villages were organized into units of 100 to 84 households, traditionally called *chaurasi*, forming the basis of *parganas*.
2.  The *amil* headed the *pargana*, while the village was led by the *muqaddam* (headman) and influential landowners (*sahu*).
3.  The village administration remained largely unchanged in its initial stages under the Turkic rule, primarily focusing on land revenue collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the village organization under the Delhi Sultanate.  The text explicitly mentions the grouping of villagers into units of 100 to 84 households (*chaurasi*), which served as the foundation for the *parganas*.  This reflects the administrative structure at the local level.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the key figures in village administration. The *amil* is mentioned as the head of the *pargana*, a larger administrative unit encompassing multiple villages. The *muqaddam* (headman) and *sahu* (landowners) are cited as significant figures within the village itself, indicating a hierarchical structure within the village.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The passage points out that initially, the local administrative framework saw minimal alterations. The system of land revenue collection continued largely as before, indicating continuity in administrative practices during the early stages of the Sultanate. This explains the rapid establishment of Turkic authority in rural areas.

All three statements accurately reflect details from the provided text.  Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information about the prices of commodities and the economic hardship faced by ordinary people.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed the flourishing of urban economies, supported by extensive trade and the production of high-quality textiles.
3.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and cotton carder's bow significantly improved textile production, while the manufacturing of paper was a new craft introduced by the Turks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account is mentioned, it focuses more on products, travel conditions, and general observations, rather than providing detailed price information or extensive documentation of the economic hardship of ordinary people. The text does allude to the hardships faced by peasants but doesn't directly link it to Ibn Battuta's account.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly describes the growth of urban centers and a thriving urban economy during the Sultanate period. The production of high-quality textiles in Bengal and Gujarat, along with the mention of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay, supports this claim.

Statement 3 is also correct. The passage highlights improvements in textile production due to the introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow.  It also specifically mentions the introduction of paper manufacturing as a new craft, attributing it to the Turks.

Option (a) is the most appropriate answer because statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the economic conditions described in the provided text.  Statement 1, while not entirely false, is a misrepresentation of the scope of Ibn Battuta's account.


**4. With reference to the social structure under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Peasants constituted the vast majority of the population, with a significant portion living at subsistence levels, impacted by famines and wars.
2.  The *khudkashts* were prosperous owner-cultivators who dominated village panchayats and enjoyed a higher standard of living than ordinary peasants.
3.  The Hindu *rais* (autonomous rajas) maintained significant power and influence, even within areas under direct Sultanate control, often visiting the court of rulers like Balban.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately depicts the social landscape of the Delhi Sultanate.  The passage emphasizes the large peasant population, many of whom struggled to survive, frequently facing hardships due to famines and conflicts. This highlights the economic realities for the majority of the population.

Statement 2 correctly describes the *khudkashts*. The text identifies them as relatively wealthy owner-cultivators who held considerable influence in village governance and enjoyed a better lifestyle compared to landless peasants. This points to social stratification within rural communities.

Statement 3 is also accurate. The passage mentions the continued presence and power of Hindu *rais* (autonomous rajas) even under the Sultanate's rule. The reference to their visits to Balban's court underlines their significant political influence despite the Sultanate's authority.

All three statements align with the information presented in the text. Option (b) is therefore the correct answer, encompassing the social hierarchy and dynamics within the Delhi Sultanate.


**5. With reference to trade and industry during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The improved communication and a stable currency system fueled trade growth, leading to the expansion of towns and urban life.
2.  Bengal and Gujarat were renowned for their high-quality textiles, while Cambay was famous for textiles and gold and silver work.
3.  India's foreign trade encompassed both overland and maritime routes, with Indian traders (Tamils, Kalingas, Gujaratis) actively participating alongside Arab merchants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that improvements in communication and the establishment of a robust currency system (silver *tanka* and copper *dirham*) stimulated trade growth, leading to the development of towns and urban life. This signifies the economic impact of these policies.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text specifically highlights the reputation of Bengal and Gujarat for their fine textiles. Cambay's prominence in textile production and its expertise in gold and silver work are also mentioned, illustrating the specialization of certain regions in specific crafts.

Statement 3 accurately describes the nature of India's foreign trade. The passage notes that trade occurred both through land and sea routes, and importantly, it emphasizes the significant participation of Indian traders alongside Arab merchants, showing a complex interplay in the commercial sphere.

All three statements accurately reflect details provided in the passage, making option (b) the correct choice.  The statements collectively paint a detailed picture of the economic activities and trade networks under the Delhi Sultanate.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Mongol Empire in East Asia:**

3. Marco Polo's accounts detail the court of Kublai Khan and his travels through Southeast Asia, highlighting increased commercial and cultural contacts between different parts of the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Mongol Empire's history in East Asia.  Statement 1 correctly describes the destructive yet unifying impact of the Mongol conquest of China.  The Mongols, despite their brutality, achieved a level of political unification previously unseen in China. Statement 2 accurately notes the vast geographical extent of the Mongol Empire, encompassing not only China but also significant parts of Southeast Asia and Korea.  The inclusion of Tonkin and Annam (Vietnam) within their sway is a historically accurate detail. Statement 3 correctly points to Marco Polo's firsthand account as a significant source of information regarding the Mongol court and the increasing global interconnectedness during that period. His journey, including his visit to Malabar in India, underscores the growing commercial and cultural exchange between distant regions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one true statement.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Mongol Empire's impact on East Asia and global interconnectedness.


**2. With reference to the Sailendra and Kambuja empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sailendra dynasty, which established the Srivijaya empire, flourished from the 7th to the 10th centuries and controlled Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, parts of Siam (Thailand), and even the Philippines.
2.  The Kambuja empire, which succeeded the Hinduized kingdom of Funan, extended over Cambodia and Annam (south Vietnam) and was known for its magnificent temples, including Angkor Wat.
3. The Pallava navy, based in the Bay of Bengal, played a significant role in maintaining sea trade with Southeast Asia and China, while the Chola ruler's naval expeditions further secured these trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually accurate. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Sailendra dynasty's reign, its geographical reach encompassing a substantial portion of Southeast Asia, and its significant maritime power.  The vastness of the Srivijaya empire, as described by a 9th-century Arab writer, is a well-documented fact. Statement 2 accurately describes the Kambuja empire's rise to power, its geographical extent, and its renowned architectural achievements, including Angkor Wat, a testament to its cultural and economic prosperity. The temple's depiction of scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata highlights the influence of Indian culture. Statement 3 correctly highlights the role of the Pallava and Chola navies in safeguarding trade routes in the Bay of Bengal and beyond, emphasizing the importance of maritime power in maintaining trade connections with Southeast Asia and China. The Chola expeditions to Sumatra and Malaya demonstrate active protection of trade interests.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, encompassing all the accurate statements. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and omit crucial historical details. This question tests factual recall and understanding of Southeast Asian history and its interaction with India and China.


**3. With reference to the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism in Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Buddhism spread from India to Southeast Asia primarily through the activities of Indian traders and monks, leading to the assimilation of Hindu gods into the Buddhist fold and even the adoption of Hindu temples.
2. The flourishing of Buddhism in Southeast Asia contrasted with its decline in India, while the assimilation of Hindu elements into Buddhism highlights the complex religious interactions of the region.
3.  Many Chinese and Indian scholars visited Palembang, the capital of the Srivijaya empire, a center of Sanskrit and Buddhist studies, contributing to the rich cultural exchange between India, China, and Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism in Southeast Asia. Statement 1 correctly describes the role of Indian traders and monks in disseminating Buddhist teachings across the region.  The subsequent syncretism, blending Hindu and Buddhist elements, is a well-established aspect of Southeast Asian religious history.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the contrasting trajectories of Buddhism in India and Southeast Asia, with the latter experiencing continued growth while the former underwent a decline. The assimilation of Hindu deities and practices into Buddhist traditions illustrates the region's unique religious landscape. Statement 3 accurately points to Palembang's importance as a center of learning and cultural exchange, highlighting the interaction between Indian, Chinese, and local scholars.  The presence of Sanskrit and Buddhist studies in Palembang emphasizes the region's role as a bridge between different cultures. Thus, option (c) is the only option that includes all three accurate statements. The other options are incomplete and fail to capture the full complexity of the religious and cultural exchanges in Southeast Asia.  The question tests factual recall, analysis of religious interactions, and understanding of cultural exchange.


**4.  With reference to the maritime trade in the Indian Ocean during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indian merchants relied heavily on the South-East Asian trade route after the decline of the Roman Empire and the Huna invasions, utilizing ports like Tamralipti for trade with China.
2.  The Gujarati and Arab traders continued to dominate lucrative trade routes in textiles, rice, and sugar, exchanging these goods for spices, gold, horses, silk, and porcelain from various regions.
3. The Portuguese, while unable to fully monopolize Asian trade, impacted the Malabar and Bengal trade routes and opened new trade connections with Japan and the Philippines, facilitating the exchange of goods like copper, silver, and Indian textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indian Ocean trade during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly identifies the shift towards increased reliance on Southeast Asian trade routes following the decline of the Roman Empire and the Huna invasions. The mention of Tamralipti as a significant port for trade with China is historically accurate.  Statement 2 correctly describes the continued dominance of Gujarati and Arab traders in key trade routes, highlighting the exchange of various goods across different regions. The statement accurately reflects the established patterns of trade and the goods involved. Statement 3 correctly assesses the Portuguese impact on Asian trade. While they failed to achieve a complete monopoly, their naval power disrupted existing trade routes and opened new connections with Japan and the Philippines, leading to the exchange of specific goods. The statement accurately reflects the limited success and significant impact of Portuguese involvement.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, as it encompasses all three accurate statements.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and do not fully represent the complexities of the Indian Ocean trade during this period. The question tests factual recall, analysis of trade patterns, and understanding of the impact of European powers on existing trade networks.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the political landscape of North India after the decline of Harsha's empire:**

1. Following Harsha's death, the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires emerged as dominant powers, each controlling significant territories but none achieving complete control over the entire Ganga valley.
2.  Control of Kanauj was highly significant, symbolizing sovereignty over the upper Gangetic valley and its resources, leading to tripartite struggles between the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires.
3. Lalitaditya of Kashmir temporarily controlled Kanauj and the Punjab, highlighting the shifting power dynamics and the importance of Kanauj as a symbol of North Indian sovereignty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the political situation in North India after the decline of Harsha's empire. Statement 1 correctly identifies the rise of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires as major players, emphasizing the fragmented nature of power and the absence of a single overarching empire controlling the entire Ganga valley.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the strategic importance of Kanauj, its symbolic significance as a center of power, and the resulting conflicts between the three major empires for control over this crucial region. The tripartite struggle is a well-documented aspect of this period. Statement 3 correctly mentions Lalitaditya's temporary control of Kanauj and the Punjab, demonstrating the fluidity of power and the continued importance of Kanauj as a symbol of North Indian dominance.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as it includes all three accurate statements. The other options are incomplete and fail to fully capture the political complexities of this era. The question tests factual recall, understanding of political power dynamics, and the ability to analyze the significance of specific locations in shaping the historical narrative.

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Deva Raya I's military campaigns to recover lost territories south of the Krishna River ended in a compromise, leaving the existing frontiers unaltered. This highlights the limitations of Vijayanagara's power and the persistent challenge posed by the Bahmani Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that rulers of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim paid tribute to Deva Raya II, it immediately casts doubt on the regularity and extent of this tribute, particularly from Pegu and Tenasserim.  The assertion of significant naval power based solely on this tribute is a misrepresentation; the tribute might have been symbolic gifts or diplomatic gestures rather than consistent revenue streams.  The text suggests contact and diplomatic relations rather than direct control.

Statement 3 is correct. Nicolo Conti's account accurately portrays the scale and grandeur of Vijayanagara as he described it.  The impressive dimensions of the city, the large number of soldiers, and the extensive fortifications demonstrate Vijayanagara's military strength and economic prosperity during that period. This description offers valuable insight into the city's planning, defense capabilities, and population size.  The description is a significant piece of evidence for understanding the empire's power and influence.

This was a deliberate strategy to counterbalance the influence of foreign elements and foster a more inclusive governance structure within the kingdom.  This policy is a key aspect of understanding the Bahmani kingdom's administrative and social dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's prime ministership is directly linked to the peak of the Bahmani kingdom's power and territorial reach.  His military achievements, notably the conquest of western coastal areas including Dabhol and Goa, significantly boosted the kingdom's economic strength through control over crucial trade routes.  This demonstrates his administrative capabilities and strategic vision in expanding Bahmani influence.

Statement 3 is correct. The text details Firuz Shah Bahmani's military campaign against Kherla, resulting in the defeat of Narsing Rai. The marriage alliance between Firuz Shah and Narsing Rai's daughter was a component of the peace agreement, illustrating the political strategies employed during territorial expansion.  This event is a significant detail in the timeline of Bahmani expansion.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly states that Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, shifted the focus of worship to Rama and extended his Bhakti doctrine to all four varnas, thus challenging the rigid caste system and its associated practices, including those related to food sharing. This is a crucial aspect of Ramananda's contribution to the Bhakti movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir's teachings, as described in the text, directly contradict traditional Hindu practices such as idol worship and pilgrimages.  His emphasis on the unity of God, irrespective of religious labels, and his advocacy for Hindu-Muslim unity are central to his philosophy and the impact he had on religious discourse.  His background as a weaver further highlights the movement's inclusivity.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text accurately describes Nanak's beliefs:  his emphasis on monotheism, the importance of a guru, and the necessity of moral purity for spiritual progress.  His rejection of idol worship and caste distinctions aligns with the broader aims of the Bhakti movement to promote social and religious harmony. The information provided about his background and travels further reinforces his significance.

The provided text directly supports this statement by citing observations from various European travelers who noted the stark disparity in living standards between the elite and the common populace. This observation underscores the social and economic stratification of medieval Indian society.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage details the common people's diet, highlighting the staple foods—rice, millets, pulses, fish (in coastal and eastern regions), and meat (in some southern areas).  It also correctly points out that wheat-based chapatis were common in North India.  The mention of salt and sugar as relatively expensive items further reveals the economic realities faced by ordinary people.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the unequal structure of village society, with landowning peasants (khudkashts), often from dominant castes, wielding power and exploiting weaker sections, including landless laborers. This inequality further intensified during periods of famine, underscoring the vulnerability of the marginalized population.  The description of khudkashts and their relationship with other villagers accurately reflects the social hierarchy and economic disparities prevalent in rural areas.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly details Rajaraja I's military achievements, including the defeat of the Chera navy, the conquest of the Pandya kingdom, and the annexation of a part of Sri Lanka. The text also accurately links these conquests to Rajaraja's ambition to control vital trade routes with Southeast Asia.  This demonstrates his strategic thinking and military prowess.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Rajendra I's expansionist policies, highlighting the complete subjugation of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms and the final conquest of Sri Lanka, culminating in the capture of the Sri Lankan royal family's crown.

**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempt to regain territories lost to the Bahmani Sultans south of the Krishna River resulted in a decisive Vijayanagara victory, significantly altering the existing frontiers.
2.  The claim that Vijayanagara rulers received regular tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim is questionable, suggesting instead diplomatic exchanges and gifts.
3.  Nicolo Conti's account of Vijayanagara in 1420 describes a city of sixty miles circumference, with ninety thousand men fit to bear arms, highlighting its significant military strength and size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Deva Raya I's campaigns to recover Mudkal and Bankapur did not result in a decisive victory that altered the frontiers. The text explicitly states that both sides had to agree to the existing frontiers after three hard battles. The statement misrepresents the outcome as a clear Vijayanagara win.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage expresses doubt about the regularity of tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim, suggesting instead that these were likely diplomatic gestures and gifts to maintain goodwill, rather than a consistent flow of tribute. This reflects a nuanced understanding of power dynamics and diplomatic practices.

Statement 3 is correct. Nicolo Conti's description accurately reflects the text's account of his observations in 1420, portraying a powerful and large city with a substantial military force.  The figures cited are directly from the source material.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a significant decline in the Bahmani Kingdom's power and territorial extent, leading to its eventual disintegration.
2.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of including Hindus in the administration, particularly in revenue collection, was a unique feature of his reign, unlike the practices of his predecessors.
3.  Mahmud Gawan's administration saw the Bahmani Kingdom reach its zenith in terms of power and territorial control, marked by significant military successes and economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign, while not without challenges, did not mark a decline in the kingdom's power.  The text portrays him as a significant figure who expanded the kingdom.  The disintegration occurred later.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While Firuz Shah Bahmani did include Hindus in the administration, the statement implies this was unprecedented.  The text does not explicitly state that this was completely unique,  although it does highlight it as a remarkable step.  The phrasing creates a potential for misinterpretation.

Statement 3 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister is explicitly linked in the text to the Bahmani Kingdom's peak in power and territorial extent, along with military victories and economic expansion.


**3. With reference to the political landscape of South India in the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gajapati dynasty of Orissa, after 1338, expanded its influence significantly southward, engaging in conflicts with Vijayanagara, the Reddis, and the Bahmani Sultans.
2.  The rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa significantly weakened both kingdoms, hindering their ability to participate effectively in broader north Indian politics.
3.  The battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565 marked the definitive end of the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to its immediate collapse and the loss of all its territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly describes the Gajapati dynasty's southward expansion and its conflicts with the mentioned powers after 1338.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly details the intense rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa, explaining how it prevented them from playing a larger role in north Indian politics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Battle of Bannihatti was a devastating blow, the text indicates that the Vijayanagara kingdom lingered for nearly a hundred years after the battle, although significantly weakened and diminished in territorial control.  The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process.


**4.  With reference to the early Mughal Empire's expansion, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's conquest of the Punjab was primarily motivated by the strategic importance of the region's trade routes and its proximity to the wealth of the Gangetic plains.
2. The Battle of Panipat (1526) resulted in the immediate and complete consolidation of Babur's rule across all of north India, eliminating significant opposition.
3.  The Battle of Khanwa (1527) was fought primarily to establish Mughal dominance in Rajasthan and to suppress the powerful Rajput confederation led by Rana Sanga.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage mentions Babur's limited resources in Kabul and his desire for the wealth of the Punjab as a key motivation for his expansion into India.  The text supports this as a major factor in his decision, although it doesn't exclude other reasons.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Battle of Panipat was a significant victory, the text clarifies that Babur still faced considerable challenges in consolidating his rule, including subsequent battles against Rana Sanga and other Afghan rulers.  The statement overstates the immediate and complete nature of Babur's control after Panipat.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Battle of Khanwa is described in the text as a direct consequence of the threat Rana Sanga posed to Babur's newly acquired territories. The battle aimed to secure Mughal control over Rajasthan and suppress the Rajput forces under Rana Sanga.


**5. With reference to the administration of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's subah system, established in 1580, divided the empire into twelve provinces, each governed by a subedar, with a clear separation of powers between the military and civil administrations.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy was solely based on strategic marriages, aiming to forge alliances through matrimonial ties with Rajput rulers, neglecting other forms of diplomacy.
3.  The Battle of Haldighati (1576) resulted in Rana Pratap's unconditional surrender and the complete subjugation of Mewar under Mughal rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's subah system divided the empire into twelve provinces with various officials, the statement incorrectly claims a complete separation of military and civil powers.  The text doesn't support this level of clear-cut division.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy involved a combination of matrimonial alliances, religious tolerance, and other diplomatic strategies.  The statement incorrectly presents it as being solely focused on marriages.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Battle of Haldighati did not result in Rana Pratap's surrender.  The text explicitly states that Rana Pratap continued his resistance through guerrilla warfare even after the battle, demonstrating his refusal to accept Mughal dominance.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the immediate and permanent establishment of Chola rule over the island, lasting for several centuries.
2.  Rajendra I's Gangaikondacholapuram, a new capital city, was built to commemorate his victory over the Bengal rulers and his expansion into the Ganga Valley.
3. The Chola naval expeditions against the Srivijaya Empire were primarily driven by economic motives, aiming to control trade routes and expand commerce with China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajendra I conquered Sri Lanka, the text says Sri Lanka was not under Chola control for long, only 50 years.  The statement overstates the duration and completeness of Chola rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly links the construction of Gangaikondacholapuram to Rajendra I's victory over Bengal rulers and his reaching the Ganga River.

Statement 3 is correct. Although diplomatic factors were involved, the text emphasizes that the Chola's eagerness to expand trade with China and remove obstacles to Indian traders was a key motivator for the Srivijaya campaign.


**7. With reference to the Pala Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Dharmapala's rule extended to the furthest limits of India in the northwest, encompassing areas such as Malwa and Berar, suggesting a vast and unified empire.
2. Devapala's reign saw the expansion of Pala control over Assam, parts of Orissa, and possibly Nepal, showcasing a significant territorial reach beyond Bengal.
3. The Pala rulers were exclusively patrons of Buddhism, actively suppressing other religious practices and hindering the growth of other faiths within their empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text suggests that Dharmapala's control over Malwa and Berar was through the acceptance of suzerainty, not direct rule, and the empire was not fully consolidated.  The statement misrepresents the nature and extent of his control.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly describes Devapala's expansion into Assam, parts of Orissa, and potentially Nepal.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text highlights that while the Palas were primarily Buddhist patrons, they also extended support to Saivism and Vaishnavism, demonstrating religious tolerance rather than suppression.



**8. With reference to the Pratihara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nagabhatta I's successful defense against Arab incursions from Sindh secured the Pratihara's western frontiers, preventing further Arab expansion into Rajasthan and Gujarat.
2.  Bhoja's reign marked the peak of the Pratihara Empire's power and territorial extent, with control over Kanauj and significant expansion into the east and west.
3. Al-Masudi's account of the Pratihara Empire in the early 10th century describes a vast empire with a massive army, but also highlights its significant vulnerability to internal rebellions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text credits Nagabhatta I with effectively repelling Arab incursions, securing the western frontiers.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhoja is identified in the text as the greatest Pratihara ruler, responsible for rebuilding and expanding the empire, including regaining control of Kanauj.

Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading.  Al-Masudi's account does describe a vast empire and a large army, but the text does not specifically mention significant internal rebellions as a major vulnerability *during Al-Masudi's time*.  The emphasis is on external conflicts,  making the statement a deceptive distractor.  The empire faced internal issues later.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and requiring precise factual recall.

1. The Mongols unified North and South China under a single rule for the first time, utilizing highly disciplined and mobile cavalry forces.
2.  The Mongol conquest of China in the 13th century was preceded by a period of growing weakness within the Chinese Empire.
3.  The Mongol Empire, at its height, included Korea, Tonkin (North Vietnam), and Annam (South Vietnam), but not the Philippines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mongol conquests, facilitated by their superior cavalry tactics, resulted in the unification of China, a feat not achieved before.  Statement 2 is also accurate; the internal instability of the preceding Chinese dynasty provided the opportunity for Mongol expansion.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. While the Mongols controlled Korea, Tonkin, and Annam, the text explicitly states that the Srivijaya Empire, at its height, *did* include parts of the Philippines.  This is a key detail that distinguishes the two empires and highlights the need for precise factual recall. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to differentiate between the territorial extents of distinct empires.


**2. With reference to the Srivijaya and Majapahit Empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sailendra dynasty, associated with the Srivijaya Empire, controlled Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula, but not Siam (modern Thailand).
2.  A 9th-century Arab writer described the Srivijaya Empire as so vast that even the fastest vessel would take more than two years for a round trip.
3. The Majapahit Empire, which succeeded the Srivijaya Empire, extended its reach beyond the Srivijaya's boundaries and lasted until the 15th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly mentions that the Srivijaya Empire, under the Sailendra dynasty, *did* include parts of Siam (Thailand). Statement 2 is correct. The quote from the Arab writer emphasizes the vastness of the Srivijaya Empire.  Statement 3 is also correct; the Majapahit Empire expanded upon the Srivijaya's territory and persisted longer, though its end date is closer to the 14th century than the 15th.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of Southeast Asian history, requiring careful attention to detail in the provided text.  The subtle difference in the duration of the Majapahit Empire acts as a distractor.


**3. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola navy's dominance extended to the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia and China.
2.  Chola naval expeditions to Sumatra and Malaya were primarily driven by a desire to control the spice trade routes.
3.  The Chola ruler Rajendra I’s conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) is well-documented in Chinese historical records.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Chola navy controlled the Bay of Bengal, significantly influencing trade. Statement 2 is a plausible but incorrect distractor. While trade was a factor, the text highlights the Chola's motivation was maintaining open sea lanes of communication, a broader geopolitical objective than solely economic gain. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Chola embassies reached China, the text doesn't directly link Rajendra I’s conquest of Kadaram to specific Chinese records.  The question tests factual recall and nuanced understanding of the Chola Empire's motivations and the limits of available historical evidence. The carefully crafted distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between implied and explicitly stated information.


**4. With reference to the cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramayana and Mahabharata were adapted into various art forms in Southeast Asia, including temple carvings at Borobudur.
2.  Palembang, the capital of the Srivijaya Empire, was a significant center for Sanskrit and Buddhist studies, attracting scholars from India and China.
3.  The assimilation of Hindu gods into the Buddhist pantheon was a significant feature of the religious landscape in Southeast Asia, contrasting with trends in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  The text explicitly supports each statement.  Borobudur's carvings depict scenes from the Indian epics, Palembang served as a crucial center for learning, and the syncretic nature of Southeast Asian Buddhism, incorporating Hindu elements, is contrasted with the religious developments in India at the time. This question tests the candidate's ability to synthesize information across different parts of the text and to understand the broader historical context of cultural diffusion.  There are no misleading statements to act as distractors; the difficulty lies in accurately recalling and integrating multiple pieces of information.



**5.  With reference to the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pratihara empire controlled the upper Gangetic valley and western India but lacked access to major seaports.
2. The Rashtrakuta empire, under Krishna III, defeated the Chola king Parantaka I and extended its reach to Rameshwaram.
3.  The Pala empire, founded by Gopala, initially controlled Bengal and later extended its influence to Magadha (Bihar).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information presented in the text. The Pratihara's lack of sea access is highlighted, Krishna III's victory and expansion are described, and Gopala's founding and expansion of the Pala empire are detailed.  This question tests factual recall and the candidate's ability to correctly associate specific rulers and empires with their territorial control and military achievements.  The difficulty stems from the need to remember the details of multiple empires and their interactions.


**6. With reference to the administrative structure of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rashtrakuta administrative structure included *rashra* (provinces), *visayas* (districts), and *bhuktis* (sub-districts), with officials often compensated with rent-free land grants.
2.  The Pala and Pratihara empires employed *uparikas* as provincial governors and *visayapatis* as district heads, mirroring a hierarchical system.
3.  The village, as the basic unit of administration, saw the rise of hereditary revenue officers in the Deccan, impacting local self-governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the administrative structures described in the provided text. The question tests factual knowledge of administrative terms and their functions within the context of medieval Indian empires. The use of specific administrative terms increases the question's difficulty, requiring precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**7. With reference to the Chola Empire's administration and local governance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola army comprised elephants, cavalry, and infantry, with the infantry primarily armed with bows and arrows.
2.  The *nadu*, a basic administrative unit, comprised several villages, and *valanadus* were groupings of *nadu*.
3. The *ur* and *sabha/mahasabha* were village assemblies, with the *mahasabha* being more prominent in Brahman villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chola army had elephants, cavalry, and infantry, the text specifies that infantry were primarily armed with *spears*, not bows and arrows. Statement 2 is correct, accurately describing the Chola administrative hierarchy. Statement 3 is also correct, distinguishing the roles and prevalence of the different village assemblies. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the Chola administrative system and to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire under Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1. Krishna Deva Raya's victory over the ruler of Orissa restored Vijayanagara territories up to the Krishna River.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya’s reign saw a shift in Telugu literature from imitating Sanskrit works to producing independent works.
3.  Krishna Deva Raya's administration was characterized by strict religious intolerance, persecuting non-Hindus.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, as the text details Krishna Deva Raya’s military success against Orissa. Statement 2 is also correct; the shift in Telugu literature is mentioned.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states Krishna Deva Raya's administration was known for its religious tolerance. This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern factual statements from misleading ones concerning religious policy.  The inclusion of a false statement about religious intolerance increases the question's difficulty.


**9. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and its administration under Mahmud Gawan, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, an Iranian by birth, implemented significant internal reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces called *tarafs*.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's efforts to reconcile the Deccanis and foreigners ( *afrans*) within the Bahmani nobility were completely successful.
3.  Mahmud Gawan founded a renowned madrasa (college) in Bidar, attracting scholars from Iran and Iraq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, detailing Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms. Statement 3 is also correct, describing his patronage of learning and the establishment of the madrasa. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahmud Gawan attempted reconciliation, the text explicitly states that party strife continued, ultimately leading to his execution.  The question tests the candidate's comprehension of administrative reforms and the limits of Mahmud Gawan's success in resolving internal conflicts. The incorrect statement serves as a significant distractor.


**10. With reference to the early career of Shivaji Maharaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's early conquests included the capture of Javli from Chandra Rao More, securing control of the Mavala region.
2.  The death of Dadaji Kondadeo in 1647 marked the beginning of Shivaji's independent rule and control of his father's jagir.
3.  Shivaji's initial conflicts with the Mughals were marked by significant military defeats, leading to the loss of several key forts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The text describes Shivaji's conquest of Javli and the assumption of independent control after Kondadeo's death. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Shivaji faced challenges, the text doesn't depict his early conflicts as marked by *significant* military defeats.  Instead, it highlights his strategic use of guerrilla warfare and cunning tactics. The question tests the ability to distinguish between the factual progression of Shivaji's career and potentially misleading interpretations of his early military engagements. The inclusion of a statement that is partially true but ultimately inaccurate increases the difficulty of the question.

Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is indeed noted for its relative religious tolerance and the prominent roles held by Hindus in his administration, contributing to a period of cultural and literary growth in Bengal. The Ahom kingdom's successful resistance against the Bengal Sultans and its Hinduization are well-documented historical facts, highlighting the complexities of religious and political interactions in the region. Finally, the annexation of Kamata and the subsequent establishment of an Afghan colony, along with the failed attempts to conquer the Ahoms, accurately portray the Sultanate's expansionist ambitions and their limitations in the Brahmaputra valley.

**2. With reference to the political and religious climate of medieval Orissa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ganga dynasty, known for constructing the Puri temple and the Sun Temple at Konark, lost prestige after raids by Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq, leading to the rise of the Gajapati dynasty.
2. The Gajapati dynasty, succeeding the Ganga dynasty, focused primarily on southern expansion, leading to conflicts with Vijayanagara, the Reddis, and the Bahmani sultans.  This southward focus might have been partly due to the perceived strength of the Bengal Sultans.
3. The Saraswati River served as the border between Orissa and Bengal during the Sultanate period, with intermittent fighting between the two regions, but the Orissa rulers maintained their control up to the Saraswati.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe key aspects of medieval Orissa's history. The decline of the Ganga dynasty after the raids by Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq, paving the way for the Gajapati dynasty, is historically accurate. The Gajapati rulers' expansionist policies towards the south, resulting in conflicts with powerful neighbors like Vijayanagara, are well-established.  The mention of the perceived power of the Bengal Sultans as a factor influencing the Gajapati's southward expansion reflects a valid historical interpretation.  Finally, the Saraswati River's role as a border between Orissa and Bengal and the intermittent conflicts, with Orissa retaining control up to the river, is consistent with historical accounts.  The statements do not contain any inaccuracies or misleading information.

2. While known for his acts of religious intolerance, such as the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur, he also employed Hindus in his government, including ministers from the Bania community.
3. Ahmad Shah I's reign saw the subjugation of the powerful Idar fort and the Rajput states of Jhalawar and Bundi, while his rivalry with Malwa weakened both kingdoms and prevented them from playing a larger role in North Indian politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

His policies were marked by a complex blend of religious tolerance and intolerance.  The employment of Hindu ministers alongside the destruction of temples at Sidhpur highlights this contradictory approach. His military successes in subduing powerful Rajput states and his persistent rivalry with Malwa, which ultimately limited the influence of both kingdoms in North Indian politics, are also consistent with historical accounts.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the economic realities of medieval India. The low wages of artisans and servants under Alauddin Khalji indicate the prevailing economic disparities. The wages under Akbar, while slightly higher, still reflect significant economic inequalities, even for unskilled laborers. The statement about the overall economic inequalities in medieval society, with the disparity being more pronounced in urban Muslim areas, is consistent with historical accounts. The statements are factually correct and do not contain misleading information.  They correctly highlight the significant economic stratification within the society.


**8. With reference to the caste system and social customs in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the prevailing social norms and interpretations of the caste system and the status of women in medieval India.  Smriti texts continued to emphasize the Brahmin's high status and prescribed roles for different castes, while also acknowledging practical realities like the Brahmin's engagement in agriculture. The traditional limitations on women's roles, including early marriage and restrictions on widow remarriage, are well-documented.  Statement 3, while touching upon a sensitive and complex issue, is partially accurate. While some Smriti writers did discuss sati, it is inaccurate to say there was debate on its permissibility; rather, some commentators allowed it under certain conditions.  The prevalence of sati is supported by foreign accounts, but the characterization of a debate is an oversimplification.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the economic life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate saw a flourishing urban economy, necessitating large-scale commerce.
3.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder’s bow significantly improved textile production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable information about the products, roads, and life in India during the Delhi Sultanate, it doesn't provide extensive detail on the economic conditions of ordinary people. His focus was largely on the court and his travels.  The text emphasizes the scarcity of information regarding the economic state of commoners.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Delhi Sultanate exhibited a flourishing urban economy that required significant commercial activity. The growth of towns and cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, Multan, etc., points to this.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage highlights the improvements in textile production brought about by the introduction of the spinning wheel and the wider use of the cotton carder’s bow (dhunia).  These technological advancements enhanced efficiency and quality in cotton processing and weaving.  The text explicitly mentions this as a factor in improving textile production.


**2. With reference to the administration of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pargana was the smallest administrative unit, directly responsible for revenue collection from individual cultivators.
2.  The chaurasi, a traditional grouping of villagers, formed the basis of the pargana’s administrative structure.
3.  The amil, the head of the pargana, was directly accountable to the muqti, who remitted the balance of income to the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The pargana was not the smallest unit; it was above the village level. Revenue collection at the village level was handled by different officials and structures, not directly by the Amil. The Amil was the head of the pargana, a larger administrative unit encompassing multiple villages.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that villagers were grouped into units of 100 to 84 (chaurasi), forming the foundation of the pargana system. This indicates the chaurasi played a crucial role in the organization of the pargana's structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the amil was the head of the pargana, the text does not clearly state that he was directly accountable to the muqti. The muqti's responsibility was primarily remitting revenue to the center after meeting expenses.  The lines of accountability between the amil and the muqti are not explicitly detailed.


**3. With reference to the social structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of the population consisted of peasants who mostly lived at a subsistence level.
2.  The village panchayats were solely dominated by the wealthy owner-cultivators (sahuks).
3.  The Hindu rais, autonomous rajas, maintained considerable power even within areas directly controlled by the Delhi Sultans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that peasants formed the vast majority of the population and lived a life of hard work and barely sufficient subsistence.  Recurring famines and wars further exacerbated their hardships.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that prosperous owner-cultivators (sahuks) dominated the village panchayats, it doesn't state that they were the *sole* dominant group. Other influential figures, like the village headmen (mugaddams), also played important roles in village governance.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that numerous Hindu rais (autonomous rajas) retained considerable power and influence, even within regions under the direct control of the Delhi Sultans. Their presence at Balban's court highlights their continued significance.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the trade and industry during the Delhi Sultanate:**

1.  Bengal and Gujarat were renowned for their high-quality textiles.
2.  Cambay (Khambayat) was primarily famous for its handicrafts and opium cultivation.
3.  The Delhi Sultanate's sound currency system (silver tanka and copper dirham) hindered the growth of trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text specifically mentions Bengal and Gujarat as centers for the production of fine fabrics and textiles.  Their quality was highly valued, contributing to their prominence in trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cambay is described as being famous for textiles and gold and silver work, not handicrafts and opium cultivation. The text doesn't mention opium cultivation as a significant aspect of Cambay's economy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the establishment of a sound currency system based on the silver tanka and copper dirham *facilitated* the growth of trade in the country, not hindered it.  A stable currency system is generally crucial for economic growth and trade expansion.



**5. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included dividing the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's most significant challenge was the lack of internal trade and commerce.
3.  Mahmud Gawan's madrasa in Bidar primarily catered to local scholars and students.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly details Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each under a tarafdar.  This is a key aspect of his administrative legacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text doesn't suggest the Bahmani Kingdom faced a significant challenge due to a lack of internal trade.  In fact, the implication is that trade flourished.  The primary challenge was the internal strife among nobles.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Mahmud Gawan's madrasa in Bidar attracted renowned scholars from Iran and Iraq, not just local scholars and students. The text specifically mentions that some of the most famous scholars of the time from Iran and Iraq attended the madrasa.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The succession crisis following Deva Raya II's death led to a series of civil wars and the weakening of the empire.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked a decline in Telugu literature, with a return to imitation of Sanskrit works.
3.  The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) is widely considered to mark the end of the Vijayanagara Empire's golden age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the lack of a primogeniture system after Deva Raya II's death led to succession struggles, civil wars, and the weakening of the empire's central authority.  This internal conflict significantly impacted the empire's strength and stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked a *new era* in Telugu literature, moving away from the imitation of Sanskrit works towards independent works. This represents a flourishing of Telugu literary traditions.

Statement 3 is correct. The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) is described in the text as generally marking the end of the great age of Vijayanagara, although the kingdom persisted for another century in a diminished state.  This battle represents a significant turning point in the empire's history.


**7. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of the Punjab and Multan significantly altered the political landscape of North India, making deeper incursions into the Gangetic heartland possible.
2.  The Rajput rulers consistently lacked the strategic vision to effectively counter the Turkish advance, focusing primarily on internal conflicts.
3.  The Second Battle of Tarain (1192) resulted in the immediate and complete collapse of the Rajput kingdoms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text highlights that the Ghurid conquest of the Punjab and Multan fundamentally changed the political dynamics of North India, paving the way for further incursions into the Gangetic plains.

Statement 2 is correct. The text criticizes the Rajput rulers for a lack of "strategic vision," highlighting their failure to mount a concerted effort to recover lost territories like Kabul and Lahore, and for being preoccupied with internal conflicts. This lack of unified action facilitated the Turkish advance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Second Battle of Tarain was a decisive victory for the Ghurids, it did not lead to the immediate and total collapse of the Rajput kingdoms.  Many Rajput kingdoms continued to exist, although under pressure from the Turks, and some even maintained considerable power for a time.



**8. With reference to the administrative policies of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms aimed at reducing the power of the khuts and muqaddams by bringing them to the level of ordinary cultivators.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's market control measures, including price fixing, were primarily intended to ensure the welfare of the common people.
3.  Alauddin Khalji's military reforms focused solely on increasing the size of the army, without any emphasis on efficiency or organization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Alauddin Khalji's policy of trying to reduce the khuts and muqaddams (village headmen) to the position of ordinary cultivators, thereby curbing their power and influence. This was a crucial aspect of his agrarian reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji's market control measures did have some impact on the common people, their primary goal was not their welfare.  They were primarily designed to ensure a stable and affordable supply of essential goods for the army and to prevent inflation. The text doesn't portray this policy as primarily welfare-oriented.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text states that Alauddin Khalji's military reforms were successful in creating a large and *efficient* cavalry, which points to an emphasis on both size and effectiveness.  The passage mentions that the efficiency of the cavalry played a crucial role in repelling Mongol attacks.


**9. With reference to the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad was a complete failure, with no long-term benefits.
2.  The introduction of token currency was a well-planned measure, but its failure was primarily due to the inability of the government to prevent counterfeiting.
3.  Muhammad Tughlaq's military campaigns, including the Khurasan project, were primarily aimed at establishing a scientific frontier.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the transfer of the capital to Daulatabad initially faced challenges and was eventually abandoned, the text indicates it had some long-term benefits. It fostered interaction between north and south India, improving communication and cultural exchange.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explains that the token currency experiment's failure stemmed from the government’s inability to control counterfeiting, despite the underlying concept having merit. The implementation flaws are highlighted.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text doesn't explicitly state that the Khurasan project's primary aim was to establish a scientific frontier.  While the text mentions the "scientific frontier" concept, it does not directly link it to the Khurasan project’s primary goal. The actual objective of the Khurasan project remains unclear.  The text also mentions other objectives and campaigns.


**10. With reference to the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah is considered a significant period for the development of the Bengali language and literature.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's administration was characterized by a policy of religious intolerance and discrimination against Hindus.
3.  The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley were consistently successful.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) was a crucial period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature.  The flourishing of Bengali writers during this time is highlighted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is depicted as a period of religious tolerance, with Hindus holding high positions in his administration. This contrasts with the statement's claim of intolerance and discrimination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Bengal Sultanate's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley resulted in a series of defeats, despite repeated efforts.  Success was limited and inconsistent.


**1. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information about the prices of commodities, agricultural practices, and the lives of ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a decline in long-distance trade within India, leading to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs).
3.  The majority of the population during the Delhi Sultanate comprised peasants who worked hard to eke out a bare subsistence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ibn Battuta's detailed account offers valuable insights into the economic conditions, agricultural practices, and daily lives of the people during the Delhi Sultanate. His observations on prices, crops, and the overall lifestyle of ordinary people are considered a significant source for understanding the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Delhi Sultanate did see a decline in *long-distance* internal trade in North India, leading to the decline of some trade guilds, it's inaccurate to say *all* guilds declined.  The text specifically mentions a decline in North India, and that some guilds in South India continued to thrive, particularly those involved in overseas trade.  The statement overgeneralizes the impact on trade guilds.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that peasants formed the vast majority of the population and that their lives were characterized by hard work and a struggle for bare subsistence.  Recurring famines and wars exacerbated their hardships.  This aligns with historical understanding of the socio-economic conditions of the peasantry during this period.


**2. With reference to the overseas trade of India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary Indian port for trade with Southeast Asia was Tamralipti (Tamluk) in Bengal.
2.  The Manigraman and Nandesi were prominent trade guilds active in overseas trade since early times.
3.  The Chinese government, in the 13th century, attempted to restrict the export of gold and silver due to the favorable trade balance with India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly identifies Tamralipti (Tamluk) in Bengal as the chief Indian port for voyages to Java, Sumatra, and other Southeast Asian destinations.  Many accounts from the period mention merchants embarking from this port.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically names the Manigraman and Nandesi as prominent trade guilds actively engaged in both retail and wholesale trade across numerous foreign countries.  Their long history and substantial influence are highlighted.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explains that due to the significant influx of gold and silver into countries trading with China (partially due to India’s favorable balance of trade), the Chinese government in the 13th century attempted to regulate and restrict the outflow of these precious metals. This reflects the economic impact of India's robust overseas trade.


**3. With reference to the social stratification and economic conditions during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently documented the ostentatious lifestyle of the ruling classes in contrast to the widespread poverty among ordinary people.
2.  The khudkashts were landless peasants who often tilled the land of zamindars or upper castes, barely making a living.
3.  The Mughal state provided incentives and loans (taccavi) to peasants to encourage agricultural expansion and improvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Accounts from numerous European travelers consistently portray a stark contrast between the opulent lives of the Mughal nobility and zamindars and the pervasive poverty experienced by the majority of the population, including peasants, artisans, and laborers.  This disparity is a recurring theme in their writings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Khudkashts were *not* landless peasants.  The text explicitly defines them as peasants who owned the land they cultivated.  The description in the statement conflates khudkashts with landless laborers or sharecroppers.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions that the Mughal state actively implemented policies to support agricultural growth, including providing incentives and financial assistance (taccavi) to peasants to encourage expansion and improvement of cultivation. This demonstrates the state's interest in agricultural productivity.


**4.  With reference to the cultural developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi was significantly influenced by the Bhakti movement and the use of these languages by Sufi saints.
2.  Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing many Perso-Arabic airs (ragas) into Indian classical music and is also attributed with inventing the sitar.
3.  The Vijayanagara empire, known for its patronage of arts and literature, saw the development of distinct cultural traditions different from those of North India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly links the rise of regional languages to the Bhakti movement and the adoption of these languages by Sufi saints for religious poetry and dissemination of their teachings.  This contributed significantly to the development and standardization of these languages.

Statement 2 is partially correct regarding the introduction of Perso-Arabic airs. However, the claim that Amir Khusrau invented the sitar is unsubstantiated by the text; it only states that he is *credited* with it, which is not definitive.  While he was a significant figure in music, attributing the sitar's invention to him definitively is inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text emphasizes the unique cultural synthesis that developed within the Vijayanagara empire, with distinct features differentiating it from the cultural traditions prevalent in North India. This reflects the regional variations within the broader cultural landscape of medieval India.


**5. With reference to the political and military aspects of the early medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of North India, marked by the battles of Tarain, resulted in the establishment of Turkish rule in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and neighboring areas.
2.  Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at the Second Battle of Tarain (1192) is widely considered a turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
3.  The Gahadavala kingdom of Kanauj, ruled by Jaichandra, offered strong resistance to the Ghurid advance, delaying the Turkish conquest of the Gangetic plains for many years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The battles of Tarain were instrumental in establishing Turkish rule in North India.  The Ghurid victories paved the way for the expansion of their control over the Ganga-Yamuna doab and beyond.

Statement 2 is correct. The Second Battle of Tarain is widely recognized as a pivotal moment in Indian history, marking a significant shift in power dynamics and leading to the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate under the Ghurids.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text shows that while Jaichandra ruled Kanauj, his resistance to the Ghurids was not prolonged or particularly effective.  The Ghurid conquest of the Gangetic plains happened relatively quickly after the battle of Tarain.  The statement overestimates the duration and success of the Gahadavala resistance.


**6. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and its successor states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a minister in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five successor states, including Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar, which played a crucial role in Deccan politics.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom's administrative language was exclusively Persian, reflecting the influence of its Turkish rulers and the lack of development of regional languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan, a prominent minister in the Bahmani kingdom, introduced substantial administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) to improve governance and efficiency. His reforms are well-documented in historical accounts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bahmani kingdom's decline and eventual disintegration led to the emergence of five independent successor states, including Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar, which significantly shaped the political landscape of the Deccan region for many years to come.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Persian held a prominent position in the Bahmani kingdom's administration, it wasn't the *exclusive* language.  The text mentions that regional languages, such as Marathi, were also used for administrative purposes, indicating a more complex linguistic scenario than the statement suggests. The statement presents an oversimplified view of the kingdom's administrative language policy.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its relations with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya, a significant Vijayanagara ruler, successfully repelled the Orissa expansion into Vijayanagara territories, restoring them to the empire's control.
2.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) is considered a crucial turning point, marking the effective end of the Vijayanagara Empire's dominance in South India.
3.  The Vijayanagara Empire maintained a strong naval power throughout its reign, enabling it to effectively counter Portuguese influence in the coastal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Krishna Deva Raya's military campaigns were successful in pushing back the Orissa incursions and restoring Vijayanagara control over territories previously seized by Orissa. This strengthened Vijayanagara's position in the South.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Talikota represents a watershed moment in South Indian history. This devastating defeat significantly weakened Vijayanagara, marking the beginning of its decline and the end of its dominance in the region.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire had a navy, the text notes that under Krishna Deva Raya (and unlike earlier rulers), the navy was relatively weak, and the empire did not effectively counter the growing Portuguese influence at sea. The statement inaccurately portrays the empire's naval capabilities during this crucial period.  The Portuguese were able to exert considerable influence, partly due to Vijayanagara’s naval weakness.


**8. With reference to the economic policies and conditions during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire's high-quality silver rupee became a standard currency across India and beyond, facilitating trade both within and outside the empire.
2.  The zabt system of land revenue assessment, requiring payment in cash, contributed to the growth of a money economy in the Mughal Empire.
3.  The majority of wealthy merchants in the Mughal Empire were Muslims, reflecting the dominance of Muslim traders in the country’s economic life.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal silver rupee, known for its high purity and standardization, became a widely accepted currency throughout India and beyond, playing a crucial role in the expansion of trade and commerce during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The zabt system, which mandated payment of land revenue in cash, significantly accelerated the shift towards a money-based economy, influencing financial transactions and commercial activities. This had a far-reaching impact on the economic structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions that while Muslim merchants (like Bohras) were prominent,  it also notes the participation of Hindu merchants (Marwaris, Gujaratis, Jains), indicating a more diverse economic participation than the statement asserts. The statement oversimplifies the religious composition of the merchant class.  The text shows a significant presence of Hindu merchants alongside Muslim ones.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that creating truly difficult MCQs that are also unambiguous and avoid trivial answers requires careful construction and potentially some assumptions about what constitutes "lesser-known" information for a UPSC-level candidate.  The difficulty level assessment is subjective.

**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a Deccan-born noble, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2. The Bahmani Kingdom's most significant challenge was the conflict between the long-established Deccanis and the foreign nobles (afghans).
3. The disintegration of the Bahmani Kingdom resulted in the emergence of five successor states, including Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar, which significantly influenced Deccan politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Mahmud Gawan was an Iranian, not a Deccan-born noble.  He did, however, implement significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces. Statement 2 is correct; the conflict between Deccanis and foreign nobles was a major source of instability. Statement 3 is also correct; the Bahmani kingdom fragmented into five successor states, with Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar playing prominent roles in Deccan politics.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent Gawan's origin or omit key aspects of the Bahmani kingdom's decline and its impact.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's succession to the throne consistently followed the principle of primogeniture.
2. Krishna Deva Raya (1509-1530) is widely considered the greatest Vijayanagara ruler, known for his military prowess and administrative reforms.
3. The battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565 marked the definitive end of the Vijayanagara Empire's dominance, leading to its rapid disintegration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Vijayanagara Empire did *not* consistently follow primogeniture, leading to frequent succession crises and civil wars.  Statement 2 is correct; Krishna Deva Raya is widely regarded as the greatest Vijayanagara ruler due to his military victories and administrative achievements. Statement 3 is largely correct; Bannihatti marked the end of Vijayanagara's major power, although the kingdom lingered for a while.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either falsely claim primogeniture or downplay the significance of the battle of Bannihatti.


**3. With reference to the cultural exchange between North and South India during the Medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bahmani Kingdom acted as a crucial cultural bridge between North and South India, fostering a distinct cultural synthesis.
2. The Vijayanagara Empire's patronage of Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil literature significantly contributed to the development of regional languages.
3. The widespread use of Sanskrit declined during the medieval period due to the rise of regional languages and the patronage of Bhakti saints.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Bahmani kingdom facilitated cultural exchange, leading to a unique blend of northern and southern traditions. The Vijayanagara rulers' support for regional languages promoted their growth. The decline of Sanskrit's dominance was indeed linked to the rise of regional languages and the influence of Bhakti movements.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the complex interplay of cultural and linguistic developments in medieval India.  The other options are incomplete or inaccurate in their assessment of this multifaceted process.


**4. With reference to the post-Delhi Sultanate period in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquests, culminating in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192), marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Gahadavala kingdom of Kanauj, a powerful force in the Gangetic plains, offered significant resistance to the Ghurid advance, delaying the establishment of Turkish rule in the region.
3.  The initial phase of Turkish rule in North India witnessed a complete suppression of Hindu religious practices and a rapid Islamisation of society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Second Battle of Tarain was pivotal in establishing Turkish dominance. Statement 2 is also correct; the Gahadavala kingdom did resist, although ultimately unsuccessfully.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the initial Turkish rule didn't lead to a complete suppression of Hindu practices; rather, a complex process of interaction and synthesis occurred.  The other options incorrectly include statement 3, which misrepresents the initial nature of Turkish rule.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *sulh-kul* ("peace to all") involved the abolition of the jizya tax and the promotion of religious tolerance.
2. The Mughal nobility under Akbar consisted primarily of Rajput Hindu nobles, demonstrating a complete integration of Hindu and Muslim elites.
3.  Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns, while initially successful, ultimately prolonged the Mughal Empire's decline due to protracted warfare and resource depletion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's *sulh-kul* policy was indeed characterized by religious tolerance and the abolition of the jizya tax. Statement 2 is largely incorrect; while Akbar did include Rajputs, the nobility was more diverse and not dominated by them. Statement 3 is correct; Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns were costly and contributed to the empire's weakening. Options (b), (c), and (d) are inaccurate due to the misrepresentation of the composition of Akbar's nobility or the overall impact of Aurangzeb's Deccan policy.


**1. With reference to the medieval Deccan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bahmani kingdom's internal strife was primarily fueled by the conflict between the long-established Deccanis and the newly arrived foreigners (afghans, also called gharibs).
2.  Mahmud Gawan, despite his conciliatory policies, failed to quell the factionalism within the Bahmani kingdom, ultimately leading to his execution and the kingdom's disintegration.
3.  The successor states of the Bahmani kingdom, including Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda, significantly influenced Deccan politics until their absorption into the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bahmani kingdom's history.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the deep-seated conflict between the Deccanis and the afghans as a major source of instability. This division within the ruling elite weakened the kingdom's internal cohesion and created an environment ripe for conflict. Statement 2 accurately describes Mahmud Gawan's efforts at reconciliation and the tragic outcome of his attempts. Despite his administrative reforms and patronage of arts, he could not overcome the entrenched factionalism, leading to his execution.  This event further destabilized the Bahmani kingdom, accelerating its fragmentation. Statement 3 highlights the lasting impact of the Bahmani successor states, accurately pointing out their continued importance in Deccan politics until their eventual incorporation into the Mughal empire.  These three statements, therefore, provide a comprehensive and accurate portrayal of the political dynamics and decline of the Bahmani kingdom.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The death of Deva Raya II triggered a series of civil wars due to the absence of a firmly established principle of primogeniture in the succession.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya, considered by some historians as the greatest Vijayanagara ruler, successfully quelled internal strife, defeated rivals like Orissa and Bijapur, and implemented administrative reforms.
3.  The Battle of Talikota (Bannihatti) in 1565, marked by the execution of Rama Raya, is generally considered the end of the Vijayanagara Empire's golden age, although the kingdom persisted for a century afterward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key events and characteristics of the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 1 correctly points out the lack of a clear succession law (primogeniture) as a catalyst for the internal conflicts that plagued the empire after Deva Raya II's death. This led to power struggles among various contenders and weakened the central authority. Statement 2 accurately portrays Krishna Deva Raya's accomplishments. His reign was indeed a period of consolidation and expansion, marked by significant military victories against external threats (Orissa and Bijapur) and internal reforms that strengthened his rule.  While the claim of being the "greatest" is subjective, his achievements are undeniable. Statement 3 correctly identifies the Battle of Talikota as a pivotal event that signaled the end of the empire's golden age.  Although the kingdom continued to exist, its power and influence significantly diminished after this devastating defeat, which resulted in the death of Rama Raya, the effective ruler at the time. The subsequent century was marked by continuous decline and territorial losses.  Therefore, all three statements provide a factual and accurate depiction of the empire's history.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Battle of Khanwa, highlighting Rana Sanga's large army and Babur's use of similar tactics—artillery and flanking maneuvers—to secure victory despite facing a numerically superior force.  The battle demonstrated Babur's mastery of combined arms warfare. Statement 3 accurately recounts Krishna Deva Raya's military success against Orissa, indicating his ability to conduct prolonged campaigns and achieve significant territorial gains.  The seven-year conflict and the subsequent restoration of territories up to the Krishna River demonstrate the strength and resilience of the Vijayanagara army under his leadership.

2.  His wazir (chief minister), chief physician, chief bodyguard, and master of the mint were all Hindus, reflecting a liberal policy towards Hindus.
3.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's military campaigns successfully brought the entire Brahmaputra valley under his control, permanently annexing it to Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, fostering the flourishing of several notable Bengali writers.  This highlights the Sultan's patronage of Bengali literature and culture, a crucial aspect of his reign.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details Alauddin Hussain Shah's appointment of Hindus to high-ranking positions within his administration, including his wazir, chief physician, head of the bodyguard, and master of the mint. This demonstrates his inclusive and relatively liberal policies, a noteworthy deviation from the typical practices of many other Muslim rulers. This aspect showcases the Sultan's pragmatic approach to governance, prioritizing talent over religious affiliation.  The inclusion of Hindus in key administrative roles is a significant detail often overlooked in discussions of medieval Indian rulers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah did successfully annex Kamata (a kingdom in the western Brahmaputra valley) to Bengal with the support of the Ahoms, his subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom itself was unsuccessful.  The Ahoms, under the powerful ruler Suhungmung (Svarga Narayana), repelled this invasion, demonstrating that the entire Brahmaputra valley was not brought under his permanent control. This highlights the limitations of even a powerful Sultan's military reach and the resilience of regional powers in medieval India. The unsuccessful campaign against the Ahoms is a crucial detail that demonstrates the complexities of territorial control in this period.


**2. With reference to the administrative practices of the Sultans of Delhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *dagh* system, involving the branding of horses, was implemented to ensure the quality of military mounts and prevent soldiers from bringing substandard horses to muster.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms aimed at establishing a closer relationship with the rural areas, some of which were later adopted by Sher Shah Suri and Akbar.
3.  The office of *Ariz-i-Mamalik*, the head of the military department (*Diwan-i-Arz*), was established for the first time under the reign of Balban.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Alauddin Khalji's implementation of the *dagh* system, a method of branding horses to maintain the quality of military steeds. This system was a crucial element of his military reforms, aimed at increasing the efficiency and strength of his army.  This detail highlights Alauddin Khalji's attention to logistical and military details.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage states that Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms were a significant step towards strengthening ties with rural areas.  Furthermore, it notes that some of these measures were continued by his successors and served as a foundation for the later agrarian reforms implemented by Sher Shah Suri and Akbar.  This shows a continuity of administrative practices across different dynasties and highlights the lasting impact of Alauddin Khalji's policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the passage does mention Balban's attention to the *Diwan-i-Arz*, it does *not* state that he established the office of *Ariz-i-Mamalik* for the first time. The passage only indicates that Balban paid close attention to the military department's functioning, not its creation. This is a crucial distinction, showcasing the need for careful reading and understanding of subtle differences in historical accounts.  The statement incorrectly attributes the creation of the office to Balban, when the text only discusses his focus on the department's operation.


**3. With reference to the religious policies and practices of medieval Indian rulers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jalaluddin Khalji, the first Sultan of the Khalji dynasty, advocated for a state based on the willing support of its subjects, recognizing that a truly Islamic state was not feasible in a predominantly Hindu India.
2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's interactions with Hindu yogis and Jain saints, such as Jinaprabha Suri, were met with approval from orthodox Muslim theologians who praised his religious tolerance.
3.  Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat, while ordering the destruction of Hindu temples, also appointed Hindus to high positions in his government, including Manik Chand and Motichand as ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly attributes to Jalaluddin Khalji the view that the state should rely on the willing support of its subjects, acknowledging the predominantly Hindu population of India and the consequent impracticality of establishing a strictly Islamic state. This reflects his pragmatic and relatively tolerant approach to governance.  This is a significant detail illustrating the challenges of ruling a diverse population in medieval India.

Statement 3 is also correct. The passage describes Ahmad Shah I's actions, noting that despite his destruction of Hindu temples (an act interpreted as bigotry by some historians), he also appointed Hindus to high governmental positions, including Manik Chand and Motichand as ministers. This shows a complex and contradictory aspect of his rule, highlighting the inconsistencies often found in the actions of medieval rulers.  This detail showcases the nuanced nature of religious and political dynamics during the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that Muhammad bin Tughlaq's interactions with Hindu and Jain religious figures were *not* well-received by orthodox Muslim theologians.  These theologians, instead, criticized him for his "rationalist" approach, accusing him of not accepting religious beliefs on faith. This illustrates the tensions between different religious and philosophical viewpoints within the society and the challenges faced by rulers attempting to navigate these tensions.  The statement presents a directly contradictory interpretation of the source material.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion and administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the Chola's maintaining control over the island for over half a century.
2. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, completed in 1010, served as a repository of Chola military victories detailed in its inscriptions.
3. Rajendra Chola I adopted the title "Gangaikondachola" after leading a successful naval expedition against the Srivijaya Empire in 1022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka indeed resulted in prolonged Chola control, lasting for more than 50 years.  This demonstrates the empire's military strength and its ability to project power beyond the mainland.  The capture of the Sri Lankan crown and royal insignia symbolized the complete subjugation of the island kingdom.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, a magnificent testament to Chola architectural prowess, was indeed completed in 1010 under Rajaraja Chola I (not Rajendra Chola I).  Crucially, the temple's inscriptions provide invaluable historical information about Chola military campaigns and victories, offering a unique insight into the empire's expansion and governance. This makes it a primary source for understanding Chola history.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I did adopt the title "Gangaikondachola" after conquering the Ganga river region, this was achieved through a land expedition to Bengal in 1022, not a naval expedition against the Srivijaya Empire.  The naval expeditions against Srivijaya were a separate and equally significant achievement during his reign, showcasing Chola naval dominance in the Bay of Bengal.  Confusing the two events and the associated titles is a common misconception.


**2. With reference to the Chola administration and local self-governance, consider the following statements:**

1.  The basic administrative unit in the Chola Empire was the Nadu, comprising several villages with close kinship ties.
2.  The Chola state was divided into four Mandalams or provinces, often governed by princes of the royal family.
3.  The Sabha, a village assembly primarily in Brahman villages (agraharams), managed village affairs with elected committees, including a crucial tank committee for water distribution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The basic administrative unit in the Chola Empire was actually the *uru* (village),  not the Nadu. Nadus were larger administrative units, grouping several urus together.  The description of Nadus having close kinship ties is largely true, but the fundamental unit was the individual village.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chola Empire was indeed divided into four Mandalams or provinces.  The appointment of princes as governors in these provinces was a common practice, reinforcing the centralized nature of the Chola administration while also allowing for regional control.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Sabha, particularly in Brahman villages (agraharams), played a crucial role in local self-governance.  These assemblies were composed of adult male landowners, and their elected committees oversaw various aspects of village life, including revenue collection, law and order, and crucially, water management through the tank committee. The existence of such committees demonstrates the sophisticated nature of Chola local administration.


**3. With reference to the cultural exchanges during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose writing style heavily influenced subsequent generations, while his brother Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  The Bhakti movement's themes, particularly the stories of Krishna and Radha, profoundly influenced lyrical poetry in various regional languages like Bengali, Oriya, and Hindi.
3.  The most influential Hindi poet of the era, Tulsidas, advocated a strict, traditional caste system based solely on birth, emphasizing complete devotion to Rama for salvation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abul Fazl, a renowned scholar and historian of Akbar's court, indeed set a literary style that influenced many writers. His brother, Faizi, another prominent figure, played a significant role in the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian, reflecting the Mughal court's interest in incorporating various cultural traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The themes of the Bhakti movement, especially the stories of Krishna and Radha, did significantly impact lyrical poetry in various regional languages during the Mughal era.  The allegorical use of the Radha-Krishna relationship to depict the bond between the individual soul and the divine resonated deeply with poets and the populace.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Tulsidas was indeed a highly influential Hindi poet who venerated Rama, his stance on the caste system was not one of strict adherence to traditional hierarchies.  Instead, he advocated for a more flexible system based on individual merit and qualities, promoting a humanistic approach to faith and social interaction.  His emphasis was on devotion to Rama as a path to salvation accessible to all, regardless of caste.  This portrayal of Tulsidas as a proponent of a rigid caste system misrepresents his views.



**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its interactions with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya II's reign saw Vijayanagara receive tribute from kingdoms as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, highlighting the empire's extensive reach and maritime power.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom under Firuz Shah Bahmani significantly incorporated Hindus into its administration, particularly in revenue collection, creating a balance against foreign influence.
3. Mahmud Gawan, the powerful prime minister of the Bahmani kingdom, significantly expanded Bahmani territory to include the western coastal areas, including Goa and Dabhol, thereby significantly weakening the Vijayanagara's access to the sea.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification. While Deva Raya II's reign saw contact with kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim, the assertion of regular tribute payment is debatable.  These interactions likely involved diplomatic exchanges and gifts rather than consistent tribute extraction.  Vijayanagara's maritime influence was considerable but not to the extent implied.

Statement 2 is correct. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a significant inclusion of Hindus in the Bahmani administration, particularly in revenue management. This policy was aimed at creating a balance of power and administrative efficiency, using the expertise of the local Hindu population.

Statement 3 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister was a period of significant expansion for the Bahmani kingdom.  His military campaigns led to the annexation of western coastal regions, including Goa and Dabhol, significantly impacting Vijayanagara's access to vital sea trade routes. This control over crucial ports gave the Bahmani kingdom a considerable advantage in maritime trade and regional influence.



**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, emphasized the worship of Rama over Vishnu, extending his Bhakti teachings across all four varnas and disregarding traditional caste restrictions on communal dining.
2. Kabir, a weaver by profession, vehemently criticized idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices, advocating for the unity of God irrespective of religious labels, while remaining a householder throughout his life.
3. Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism, undertook extensive travels throughout India and beyond, spreading his message of monotheism and rejecting caste distinctions, emphasizing character and conduct as prerequisites for approaching God, while establishing a new sect.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ramananda, a prominent figure in the Bhakti movement, indeed promoted the worship of Rama and extended his teachings to all varnas, challenging the rigid caste system's social norms, particularly regarding communal dining. His inclusive approach broadened the Bhakti movement's reach and appeal.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kabir, a weaver, was known for his sharp criticism of conventional religious practices and his emphasis on the unity of God, transcending religious labels.  He lived a householder's life, rejecting asceticism as a necessary condition for spiritual attainment.  His teachings emphasized a direct, personal relationship with the divine.

Statement 3 is partially correct but needs modification. While Guru Nanak did travel extensively and spread his message of monotheism, rejecting caste, and emphasizing character, he did not initially intend to establish a new sect. Sikhism emerged gradually from his teachings and the institution of guruship that followed.  The statement oversimplifies the complex evolution of Sikhism.  The claim that he undertook travels beyond India is not entirely substantiated by all historical accounts.


**6. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of India began with the battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192), which resulted in the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan and the establishment of Turkish rule over the Delhi area and eastern Rajasthan.
2.  Following the battles of Tarain, the Ghurids expanded their control over the Ganga-Yamuna doab, conquering the Gahadavala kingdom at Chandawar and subsequently raiding Banaras, extending their influence up to the borders of Bihar.
3.  Bakhtiyar Khalji, a Khalji officer, extended Turkish control over Bengal after a surprise attack on the Sena capital, Lakhnauti, in 1204, though his subsequent expedition into the Brahmaputra valley ended in disaster and his death.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) marked a pivotal moment in Indian history, leading to the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan and the establishment of Turkish rule in the Delhi region and parts of Rajasthan.  These battles laid the foundation for the subsequent expansion of the Turkish empire in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ghurids, after consolidating their position in Delhi, expanded their control over the Ganga-Yamuna doab.  Their victory at Chandawar against the Gahadavalas and the subsequent raid on Banaras demonstrated their growing power and their ability to penetrate deeper into the Gangetic plains.

Statement 3 is also correct. Bakhtiyar Khalji's surprise attack on Lakhnauti in 1204 resulted in the conquest of Bengal.  However, his subsequent ill-fated expedition into the Brahmaputra valley resulted in a devastating defeat and his death, highlighting the risks associated with overextension of power.  While his conquest of Bengal was significant, his death underscores the challenges of maintaining control over newly acquired territories in unfamiliar regions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pargana, a sub-unit below the province, was headed by an Amil responsible for revenue collection.
2.  Villages were organized into units of exactly 100 households, forming the foundation of Parganas.
3.  The village administration largely remained undisturbed as long as land revenue was paid, indicating a degree of autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Pargana was headed by an Amil, whose primary responsibility was land revenue collection. This reflects the decentralized nature of revenue administration under the Delhi Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that villagers were grouped into units of 100 to 84 (chaurasi), it does not specify that this was a rigid, universally applied structure. The exact organization varied and was likely flexible.  The question plays on the precision of the number (exactly 100) to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage highlights that the village administration experienced minimal interference from the Sultanate as long as the land revenue was duly paid. This suggests a degree of self-governance at the village level, a crucial aspect of understanding rural administration during that period. The statement uses the term "largely remained undisturbed" to create a possibility of some interference, thus adding complexity.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's detailed account provides comprehensive insights into the economic lives of ordinary people.
2.  The Sultanate period saw the cultivation of rice, sugarcane, wheat, oilseeds, sesame, indigo, and cotton across various regions.
3.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow significantly improved textile production, but the skill of Indian craftsmen was the most important factor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable information on various aspects of life in the Sultanate, it primarily focuses on court life and observations of products and travel conditions.  It provides limited insight into the economic conditions of ordinary people.  The question uses the word "comprehensive" to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly lists various crops cultivated during the Sultanate, showcasing the agricultural diversity of the period. This factual detail is relatively easy to recall but needs careful reading of the passage.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions the introduction of new technologies like the spinning wheel and cotton carder's bow, but emphasizes the pre-existing skill of Indian craftsmen as the most significant factor in improving textile production.  The order of importance of the factors is reversed to create a distractor.


**3.  With reference to the social structure and rural life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Peasants constituted the vast majority of the population, mostly eking out a subsistence living amidst recurring famines and wars.
2.  All peasants lived at the subsistence level, with no significant variation in their economic status.
3.  The village headmen (mugaddams) and smaller landlords (khets) enjoyed a higher standard of living than ordinary peasants, sometimes exploiting their positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly describes the peasantry as the dominant population segment struggling for subsistence amidst frequent hardships.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage directly contradicts this, stating that not all peasants lived at the subsistence level; a more prosperous section of owner-cultivators existed.  The question uses the absolute term "all" to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage details the relatively better economic conditions of village headmen and smaller landlords compared to ordinary peasants, also noting their potential for exploitation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the trade and industry during the Delhi Sultanate:**

1.  The introduction of a sound currency system based on the silver tanka and copper dirham hindered the growth of trade.
2.  Cambay was renowned for its textiles and gold and silver work, while Sonargaon in Bengal was famous for raw silk and fine cotton cloth.
3.  India's foreign trade was primarily dominated by Arab partners, who had completely displaced Indian traders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the establishment of a sound currency system *facilitated* the growth of trade, not hindered it. The question reverses the effect of the currency system to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions Cambay's reputation for textiles and metalwork, and Sonargaon's fame for silk and cotton cloth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Arabs were significant partners, the passage clearly mentions the continued presence and active participation of Indian traders (Tamils, Kalingas, Gujaratis, Marwaris, etc.), refuting the claim of complete displacement.  The question uses the absolute term "completely" to add difficulty.


**5. With reference to communication and infrastructure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq is credited with building a new road to Daulatabad and establishing an efficient postal system using relays of horses and runners.
2.  The royal roads were maintained in poor condition, posing significant risks to travelers due to robbers and dacoits.
3.  The relay system for postal communication was so efficient that fresh fruits were regularly sent to the Sultan from Khurasan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly attributes the construction of the road to Daulatabad and the improvement of the postal system to Muhammad Tughlaq.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that *royal* roads were maintained in good condition, despite the overall dangers of travel.  The question uses the word "poor" to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage cites the example of the efficient relay system enabling the delivery of fresh fruits from Khurasan to the Sultan, even when he was at Daulatabad.  This detail serves as a strong example to support the claim of efficiency.


**1. With reference to the Mongol invasions of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Changez Khan's decision not to cross the Indus in 1221 was primarily due to his preoccupation with conquering the remaining portions of the Khwarizmi empire.
2.  The river Indus remained India's western boundary throughout the 13th century, despite Mongol incursions.
3.  The Mongol defeat near Tabarhinda in 1292, led by Jalaluddin Khalji, marked a significant turning point, leading to a truce and the settlement of several thousand Mongols near Delhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Changez Khan, despite lingering near the Indus, chose not to invade India due to his focus on the remaining Khwarizmi territories. This highlights the contingent nature of the Mongol threat to India and the strategic decisions influencing their actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mongols initially desisted from crossing the Indus beyond a certain point, their incursions did push the western boundary of the Delhi Sultanate eastward over time, from the Jhelum to the Beas. The Indus, therefore, did not consistently serve as the definitive western boundary throughout the 13th century.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the defeat of Abdullah, a grandson of Hulagu, near Tabarhinda by Jalaluddin Khalji. This resulted in a truce and the assimilation of several thousand Mongols who converted to Islam into the Delhi Sultanate. This event underscores the Sultanate's ability to absorb and integrate some Mongol elements, signifying a shift in the power dynamic. The statement accurately reflects this significant event and its consequences.


**2. With reference to the internal challenges faced by the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Hindu resistance" to the Delhi Sultanate was a unified, pan-Indian movement with consistent objectives.
2.  Bengal and Bihar consistently resisted Delhi's rule throughout the 13th century, leading to repeated military campaigns by the Delhi Sultans.
3.  The Katehariya Rajputs posed a significant threat to the Delhi Sultanate's security in the Ganga doab, requiring military intervention by Balban to secure the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes the notion of a unified "Hindu resistance." It emphasizes the diverse nature of rebellions, highlighting the varied objectives and actors involved, including ambitious Muslim chiefs and Rajput rulers pursuing their own interests.  This underscores the complexity of the resistance to the Sultanate and the limitations of simplistic interpretations.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage details the persistent challenges posed by Bengal and Bihar to the Delhi Sultanate throughout the 13th century.  It mentions multiple instances of rebellion and the Sultanate's repeated military interventions to reassert control. This highlights the Sultanate's difficulties in controlling its eastern frontiers and the long-term nature of the conflict.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the Katehariya Rajputs' significant threat to the Delhi Sultanate's security in the Ganga doab.  Balban's military campaign, involving large-scale massacres and infrastructure development, is cited as a response to this threat. This illustrates the Sultanate's need to actively manage internal security challenges and the strategic importance of the Ganga doab region.


**3. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat was facilitated by the unpopularity of the Gujarat ruler, Rai Karan, among his subjects.
2.  The Somnath temple was plundered and sacked during Alauddin Khalji's campaign in Gujarat.
3.  Alauddin Khalji's harsh methods of governance, while suppressing rebellions, ultimately weakened the Khalji dynasty by destroying the old nobility and creating a system where anyone could potentially seize power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text suggests that the ease and speed of Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat indicate the unpopularity of Rai Karan, the reigning ruler, amongst his subjects.  This points to the internal weaknesses within the Gujarat kingdom that facilitated its conquest.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the plunder and sacking of the Somnath temple during Alauddin Khalji's campaign in Gujarat. This event highlights the extent of the Sultanate's military success and the destruction of significant religious sites.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly describes how Alauddin Khalji's ruthless methods, although effective in suppressing rebellions during his lifetime, ultimately undermined the stability of the Khalji dynasty.  The destruction of the old nobility and the creation of a system where power could be easily seized are presented as long-term consequences of his policies. This analysis provides a critical perspective on the lasting impacts of his governance.


**4. With reference to the administrative reforms of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Wazir in the Delhi Sultanate primarily functioned as a military leader in the early period.
2.  Alauddin Khalji introduced the branding system (dagh) for horses and maintained descriptive rolls of soldiers to enhance the efficiency of the military.
3.  The Diwan-i-Insha was primarily responsible for the collection of land revenue and management of the state's finances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text states that while the Wazir's role evolved over time, in the early stages, they were primarily military leaders. This indicates the initial focus on military strength in the Sultanate's administration.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage accurately describes Alauddin Khalji's introduction of the dagh system for horses and the maintenance of soldier records to improve military efficiency. This shows Alauddin's attention to military organization and administration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Diwan-i-Insha was responsible for state correspondence, not revenue collection.  The department dealing with revenue and finances was the Wazir's department or a related financial office. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific functions of different administrative departments.


**5. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The silver tanka and copper dirham formed the basis of a sound currency system that facilitated the growth of trade during the Delhi Sultanate.
3.  The majority of peasants lived at subsistence level, facing challenges from recurring famines and wars.  A wealthy class of landowning cultivators also existed alongside village artisans and sharecroppers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ibn Battuta's account provides valuable information about various aspects of life during the Delhi Sultanate, it does not offer extensive details about the economic conditions of ordinary people.  His observations are more focused on the court and urban centers.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the silver tanka and copper dirham as the foundation of a stable currency system, which positively impacted trade and commerce within the Sultanate.  This highlights the importance of monetary stability in economic development.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage accurately reflects the existence of a diverse rural population, including both subsistence-level peasants and a more prosperous class of landowning cultivators.  The challenges faced by peasants due to famines and wars are also accurately highlighted. This nuanced view avoids simplistic generalizations about the rural population.


**6. With reference to the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate under Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's campaigns resulted in the Delhi Sultanate's control extending to Madurai in South India within 25 years of his accession.
2.  The conquest of Malwa and Gujarat was facilitated by existing rivalries among the Rajput dynasties of the region.
3.  The Delhi Sultanate's interest in Gujarat stemmed primarily from its desire to control the supply of horses for its armies, given the difficulties with procuring horses from Central and West Asia due to the rise of the Mongols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although Alauddin Khalji's conquests significantly expanded the Sultanate's reach into South India, the text doesn't state that Madurai was reached within 25 years.  The timeframe and the precise extent of the conquests need to be carefully examined.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately points out that the existing rivalries among the Rajput dynasties in Malwa and Gujarat facilitated their conquest by the Delhi Sultanate under Alauddin Khalji. This highlights the strategic exploitation of internal conflicts by the Sultanate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly identifies the Sultanate's interest in controlling Gujarat's horse supply as a significant factor driving its conquest.  The difficulty in obtaining horses from Central Asia due to the Mongol threat is presented as a crucial context for this policy.  This demonstrates the Sultanate's logistical and military considerations.


**7. With reference to the experiments undertaken by Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) was primarily motivated by a desire to better control South India and quell the various rebellions there.
2.  The introduction of token currency was a complete failure, leading to significant economic disruption and lasting negative consequences.
3.  The Khurasan campaign aimed at the conquest of China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that Muhammad bin Tughlaq's decision to shift the capital to Daulatabad was partly motivated by the need to better control South India and address the rebellions in the region. This action highlights his ambitions for administrative control and the challenges he faced.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the token currency experiment faced challenges and was eventually withdrawn, the text does not suggest that it was a complete failure with lasting negative consequences.  The passage indicates that the government quickly recovered, and Ibn Battuta did not observe significant long-term negative impacts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Khurasan campaign is explicitly described as aiming at Ghazni and Afghanistan, possibly with broader ambitions in Central Asia, but not at conquering China. This highlights the importance of precisely understanding the objectives of specific military campaigns.


**8. With reference to the consolidation of the Mughal empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Sindh opened trade routes down the Indus River for Punjab.
2.  Raja Man Singh's conquests in the east under Akbar's reign included Orissa, Cooch-Bihar, and parts of East Bengal, including Dacca.
3.  The abolition of the jizya tax under Akbar was primarily motivated by a desire to improve relations with the Rajputs and gain their support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Akbar's conquest of Sindh opened trade routes down the Indus River, benefiting Punjab. This shows the strategic importance of his conquests for trade and economic integration.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage correctly attributes the conquests of Orissa, Cooch-Bihar, and parts of East Bengal to Raja Man Singh during Akbar's reign.  This demonstrates the extent of Mughal expansion in the east.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While improving relations with the Rajputs was a consequence of Akbar's policies, the text suggests that the primary motivation behind abolishing the jizya tax was to establish an empire based on equal rights for all citizens, irrespective of religion. This highlights the broader ideological basis of Akbar's reforms.


**9. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The battles of Tarain and Chandawar directly led to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, without any further significant resistance.
2.  Bakhtiyar Khalji's conquest of Bengal was characterized by a surprise attack on the Sena ruler Lakshmana Sena's palace, facilitated by deception.
3.  Muizzuddin Muhammad's defeat in Central Asia in 1203 indirectly benefited the Turkish cause in India by forcing them to focus solely on consolidating their gains there.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the battles of Tarain and Chandawar were crucial, the text indicates that consolidating the Turkish conquests in North India took approximately 50 years, involving significant ongoing challenges and resistance.  This highlights the complexity of establishing a lasting empire.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes Bakhtiyar Khalji's conquest of Bengal, emphasizing the surprise attack on Lakshmana Sena's palace and the use of deception. This illustrates the tactics used in the early conquests.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Muizzuddin's defeat in Central Asia in 1203 forced the Turks to focus on India, indirectly aiding their consolidation efforts.  This illustrates the geopolitical context influencing the course of events in India.


**10. With reference to the nature of the Rajput resistance to the Turkish conquests, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajputs possessed superior weaponry compared to the Turks, including more accurate and deadly bows with poisoned arrowheads.
2.  The fragmented nature of Rajput states and the lack of strategic coordination weakened their ability to effectively resist the Turkish advance.
3.  The Rajputs' focus remained primarily within India, with limited attention paid to developments in Central Asia, despite its importance in shaping Indian history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text acknowledges certain advantages of Rajput weaponry (accuracy, poison), it does not claim clear superiority over the Turks. The passage suggests that the Turks may have had superior horses and a more effective military organization.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the fragmented nature of Rajput states and their lack of coordination as a major factor contributing to their defeat.  This points to the internal weaknesses that hampered their resistance.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately observes that the Rajputs largely neglected the significance of events in Central Asia, despite its influence on India's history. This strategic oversight contributed to their vulnerability to the Turkish invasions.


**1. With reference to the administrative practices of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language.
2.  The Ahom kingdom, initially a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had become Hinduized by the time of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign.
3. Ilyas Shah's invasion of Kamata resulted in the permanent annexation of the Kamata kingdom to Bengal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) is indeed recognized as a period of flourishing Bengali literature and language development.  The patronage extended to Bengali writers during his rule contributed significantly to its growth.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ahom kingdom, originating from North Burma, underwent a process of Hinduization over time.  By the time Alauddin Hussain Shah engaged with them, they had adopted Hindu religious and cultural practices. The text mentions that the Ahom ruler Suhungmung even changed his name to Svarga Narayana, indicating this Hinduization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ilyas Shah did invade Kamata and even reached Guwahati, he could not maintain control over the region. The Karatoya river became the northeastern boundary of Bengal, and Kamata regained much of its territory.  It was Alauddin Hussain Shah, with Ahom support, who ultimately destroyed Kamatapur and annexed the kingdom to Bengal.  This highlights the difference between temporary conquest and permanent annexation.  The temporary nature of Ilyas Shah's conquest is a crucial detail often overlooked.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gajapati dynasty of Orissa emerged after the weakening of the Ganga dynasty following raids by Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq.
2. The city of Ahmedabad was founded by Ahmad Shah I, who also shifted the capital of Gujarat from Patan.
3. Mahmud Begarha's reign in Gujarat was marked by a consistent policy of religious tolerance towards Hindus.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ganga dynasty of Orissa suffered significant setbacks due to the raids of Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq, leading to a decline in their prestige and power. This created an opportunity for the rise of the Gajapati dynasty, marking a new phase in Orissan history.  The raids weakened the existing power structure, creating a vacuum that the Gajapati dynasty filled.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ahmad Shah I is credited with founding the city of Ahmedabad in 1413 and subsequently shifting the capital of the Gujarat Sultanate there from Patan.  This act of urban planning and capital relocation is a well-established historical fact.  Ahmedabad became a significant center of trade and culture under his rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ahmad Shah I did employ Hindus in his government, his reign also witnessed the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur and the imposition of jizya tax on Hindus in Gujarat.  This indicates a policy that was not consistently tolerant. Mahmud Begarha, while a powerful ruler, also followed policies that did not consistently display religious tolerance towards the Hindu population.  The actions of Ahmad Shah I contradict the assertion of consistent religious tolerance under Mahmud Begarha.


**3. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar was significantly higher than the 16% suggested by some modern calculations.
2.  Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal were prominent Rajput nobles who served as close advisors to Akbar.
3.  The Marathas entered the Mughal nobility during the reign of Aurangzeb.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions that some modern calculations place the proportion of Hindus in Akbar’s nobility at around 16% in 1594, it also points out that this figure doesn't fully represent their actual influence and position.  The text emphasizes the significant roles held by figures like Raja Man Singh and Raja Todar Mal, suggesting their influence extended beyond mere numerical representation.   The 16% figure is presented as an incomplete picture of a complex reality.

Statement 2 is correct. Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal were indeed prominent Rajput nobles who served as close companions and advisors to Akbar. Their close relationship with Akbar is well-documented and signifies the importance of Rajput alliances in the Mughal court.  Their influence extended beyond their official roles.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb did employ Maratha nobles, the text clearly states that Jahangir was the first Mughal emperor to recognize the Marathas' importance in the Deccan and made efforts to integrate them into the nobility.  This temporal detail is crucial in differentiating the reigns of Jahangir and Aurangzeb in terms of Maratha inclusion in the nobility. The text states that Shah Jahan continued Jahangir's policy.  Aurangzeb's usage of Maratha nobles does not negate the earlier inclusion under Jahangir and Shah Jahan.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate:**

1.  The 'chaurasi' system, comprising groups of 84 villagers, formed the basis of the pargana administration.
2. The 'amil' was the head of the pargana, while the 'muqaddam' was the village headman.
3.  Under the early Delhi Sultanate, significant changes were immediately implemented at the local level in land revenue collection methods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions the existence of village groupings numbering 100 to 84, it doesn't explicitly state that the 'chaurasi' system formed the *basis* of pargana administration. The exact relationship between village units and the pargana structure remains unclear.  The text only mentions that this grouping *must have been* the basis of parganas, which is an assumption.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly identifies the 'amil' as the head of the pargana and the 'muqaddam' as the village headman. These roles within the administrative hierarchy are explicitly stated.  This is a direct and verifiable fact from the text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that in the initial stages of the Delhi Sultanate, minimal changes were made to local-level administration. Land revenue collection largely continued as before, a significant factor in the quick establishment of Turkish authority in the countryside. The later changes under Alauddin Khalji led to conflicts, including peasant rebellions.  The statement contradicts the text's assertion of minimal initial change.


**5. With reference to the military aspects of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's army's efficiency stemmed from his implementation of the 'dagh' system (branding of horses) and maintaining detailed soldier records.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate's cavalry primarily consisted of Turks and Afghans, while Hindus served mainly in the infantry.
3. Firuz Shah Tughlaq is renowned for his exceptional military leadership and numerous successful campaigns that significantly expanded the Sultanate's territory.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's military reforms, including the 'dagh' system for horse identification and detailed soldier records, significantly enhanced the efficiency and organization of his army. These measures prevented fraud and ensured the quality of the military force.  The text mentions this as a factor in his ability to contain Mongol invasions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text indicates that while Hindus served in both cavalry and infantry during the Ghaznavid period, under the Delhi Sultanate, they primarily served in the infantry. The cavalry was predominantly composed of Turks and Afghans, reflecting the ethnic composition of the ruling elite. This is a clear statement of the military composition.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly describes Firuz Shah Tughlaq as *not* a distinguished military leader. His campaigns were largely unsuccessful, particularly in Bengal, and his military administration became lax due to his policies of hereditary appointments.  The statement directly contradicts the text's assessment of Firuz Shah Tughlaq's military capabilities.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion and military achievements, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the Chola's maintaining control over the island for over half a century.
2. The Chola army's expedition to Bengal in 1022, led by a Chola general, followed the same route as Samudragupta's conquests.
3. Rajendra I's naval expeditions against the Srivijaya empire led to the Chola navy's dominance over the entire Bay of Bengal for an extended period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Sri Lanka remained under Chola control for another 50 years after its conquest.  This demonstrates the empire's lasting impact and military prowess.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra I's expedition to Bengal in 1022 did involve crossing the Ganga river and defeating local kings, the text clarifies it followed the *reverse* route of Samudragupta's conquests, not the same route. This subtle but crucial difference makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 3 is largely correct. The Chola navy's strength is highlighted, and the text mentions the Bay of Bengal being transformed into a "Chola lake," indicating dominance. However, the duration of this complete dominance is not explicitly stated as an "extended period."  It implies a period of significant control but doesn't specify its length.  The slight imprecision doesn't invalidate the statement's core truth regarding Chola naval supremacy.  Therefore, option (b) is the most appropriate choice.


**2. With reference to the Chola administration and governance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola army consisted solely of infantry, cavalry, and elephants, with spears as the primary infantry weapon.
2. The basic unit of Chola administration was the 'nadu', comprising several villages with strong kinship and other close associations.
3.  Chola rulers implemented a detailed land survey to determine the government's share of land revenue, but the exact share remains unknown.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text mentions the Chola army comprised elephants, cavalry, and infantry, but it also notes that the infantry primarily used spears. While spears were a key weapon, it is inaccurate to state that the infantry *solely* used them.  Other weapons were likely in use.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text identifies the basic administrative unit as the 'zadu', not 'nadu'.  Nadus were larger groupings of zadus. This error of terminology makes the statement false.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that Chola rulers conducted land surveys to determine their share of the land revenue but admits the precise percentage remains unknown.  This accurately reflects the historical record.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.


**3. With reference to the cultural life and architectural achievements of the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur was completed in 1010 CE, marking a significant achievement in Chola architecture.
2. The Chola rulers primarily erected temples dedicated to Shiva, neglecting Vishnu temples in their patronage.
3.  The Chola palaces were renowned for their grandeur, with some reaching five or seven stories, but none have survived to the present day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the completion of the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur in 1010 CE, highlighting its importance in Chola architectural history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that Chola rulers erected numerous temples dedicated to both Shiva and Vishnu.  The statement's assertion of exclusive Shiva temple patronage is false.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the magnificence of Chola palaces, including their height (five or seven stories), and explicitly states that none have survived. This accurately reflects the current state of archaeological knowledge.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms fostered a closer relationship between the Delhi Sultanate and rural areas, some of which were continued by his successors.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's cavalry reforms, detailed in Barani's writings, enabled him to successfully repel subsequent Mongol invasions.
3. Alauddin Khalji introduced a system of price controls primarily to suppress the cost of goods and services to his own people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms contributed to a closer relationship with rural areas and that some of his measures were continued by his successors. This highlights the lasting impact of his policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions Barani's account of Alauddin Khalji's cavalry reforms, emphasizing their role in successfully repelling Mongol attacks.  This underscores the effectiveness of his military strategies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji did introduce price controls, the text does not state that this was done primarily to benefit his people.  The primary aim, as implied, was likely to control inflation and maintain the army's effectiveness by controlling the cost of supplies. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.



**5. With reference to the economic policies and administrative reforms of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Muhammad Tughlaq's shift of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) was primarily motivated by a desire to better control South India.
2. The introduction of token currency during Muhammad Tughlaq's reign was a complete failure, leading to significant economic disruption and devaluation.
3. Muhammad Tughlaq established the 'Diwan-i-Amir-Kohi' department to implement agricultural reforms, focusing on improving cultivation techniques and crop yields in the Doab region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Muhammad Tughlaq's motivation for shifting the capital to Daulatabad was to better control South India.  This reflects his ambition to consolidate his rule over a vast territory.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The text details the disastrous consequences of the token currency experiment, including its devaluation and the government's inability to prevent counterfeiting. While the text doesn't explicitly use the word "complete," the description paints a picture of a significant economic failure.

Statement 3 is correct. The text specifically mentions the establishment of the 'Diwan-i-Amir-Kohi' department and its role in implementing agricultural reforms in the Doab region, focusing on improved cultivation and crop diversification. This demonstrates his focus on agrarian development.  Therefore, all three statements are largely accurate, making (d) the correct option.  The nuances in the wording of statements 2 do not invalidate the overall accuracy.


**6.  With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wazir, in the later period of the Delhi Sultanate, primarily focused on revenue affairs, overseeing both income and expenditure.
2. The 'Diwan-i-Arz' was primarily responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the Sultanate's judiciary system.
3.  The 'amil' was the head of a 'pargana', a subunit within the Sultanate's administrative structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the Wazir, particularly in the later period, became primarily concerned with revenue administration, managing both income and expenditure.  This reflects the evolution of the Wazir's role within the Sultanate's administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 'Diwan-i-Arz' dealt with military affairs, specifically recruitment, equipping, and paying the army. The judiciary system fell under different departments, such as the Qazi's court.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text states that the 'amil' was the head of a 'pargana,' but this is inaccurate. While 'parganas' existed, the text doesn't explicitly link them to 'amils' as their heads. The text mentions 'amils' in the context of revenue collection at the village level, but not as the heads of 'parganas'.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**7. With reference to the socio-economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of the population during the Delhi Sultanate consisted of peasants who mainly focused on subsistence farming.
2.  The introduction of the spinning wheel significantly improved the quality and production of textiles, contributing to the growth of trade.
3.  The Delhi Sultanate saw the rise of powerful merchant guilds, including the Marwaris and Gujaratis, who actively participated in both domestic and international trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates that peasants formed the vast majority of the population, largely engaged in subsistence agriculture, facing challenges like famines and wars.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the introduction of the spinning wheel and its impact on textile production, along with other technological advancements that improved efficiency.  This accurately reflects the technological changes that influenced economic activity.

Statement 3 is correct. The text details the prominence of merchant communities like Marwaris and Gujaratis, highlighting their significant role in both domestic and international trade, including their wealth and influence. This accurately reflects the dynamic trade environment of the period. Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (d) the appropriate answer.


**8. With reference to the early phase of the Delhi Sultanate's establishment and expansion, consider the following statements:**

1.  The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) marked the beginning of Turkish rule in North India.
2.  The initial consolidation of the Delhi Sultanate's power focused primarily on the eastern regions of India, including Bengal and Bihar.
3. Following the conquest of North India, the Delhi Sultanate quickly extended its control over far-flung regions, such as Gujarat and Malwa, with minimal resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the battles of Tarain laid the foundation for Turkish rule in North India. This is a well-established fact in Indian history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the initial consolidation efforts were more focused on the areas surrounding Delhi, not primarily in the eastern regions of Bengal and Bihar.  The expansion into those regions happened later.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text highlights that the early expansion faced resistance and that control over distant regions like Gujarat and Malwa was not easily established. The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate picture of the Sultanate's early expansion.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.

1. Firuz Shah Tughlaq pursued a policy of appeasement towards the nobility, aiming to prevent the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate.
2. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's military reforms strengthened the Sultanate's military capabilities and ensured its continued effectiveness.
3. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's administrative reforms included the abolition of the practice of torturing nobles and officials during audits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Firuz Shah Tughlaq adopted a policy of appeasing the nobility to prevent the Sultanate's collapse, highlighting his pragmatic approach to governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes Firuz Shah Tughlaq's military reforms as having detrimental effects, leading to laxity and inefficiency within the army.  His policies, intended to be generous, ultimately weakened the military.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions that Firuz Shah Tughlaq abolished the torture of nobles and officials during audits, demonstrating a shift towards a more lenient administrative approach.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to the political landscape of Bengal during the Sultanate period, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign in Bengal witnessed a significant flourishing of Bengali literature.
2. The Ahom kingdom, despite its initial resistance to the Delhi Sultanate, eventually became a tributary state under Bengal.
3. The Sultans of Bengal successfully annexed Kamata (Kamrup), but failed in their attempts to conquer the entire Brahmaputra valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature. This accurately reflects the cultural developments during his rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ahoms initially fought against Bengal,  the text doesn't state that they became a tributary state. The Ahom kingdom maintained its independence despite conflicts with the Bengal Sultanate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah successfully annexed Kamata (Kamrup) to Bengal but that subsequent attacks on the Ahom kingdom in the Brahmaputra valley were unsuccessful. This accurately reflects the limits of the Bengal Sultanate's expansion.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**11. With reference to the relationship between the Delhi Sultanate and neighboring kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delhi Sultanate's expansion into the Deccan was facilitated by existing conflicts and rivalries among the Rajput dynasties of Malwa, Gujarat, and Deogir.
2.  The conquest of Gujarat by Alauddin Khalji was swift and easy, suggesting a lack of strong resistance from the local ruler and population.
3. The Delhi Sultanate maintained consistent control over Bengal and Bihar throughout the 13th century, despite occasional rebellions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explains that pre-existing conflicts among Rajput dynasties in Malwa, Gujarat, and Deogir eased the Delhi Sultanate's expansion into the Deccan. This highlights the strategic advantage the Sultanate gained from exploiting these existing divisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the conquest of Gujarat was relatively swift, it also notes that the local ruler, Rai Karan, fled without offering much of a fight, but this does not necessarily imply a lack of resistance from the population.  The situation was more complex than the statement suggests.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Bengal and Bihar were largely outside the Delhi Sultanate's control for much of the 13th century, despite attempts to reassert control. The statement contradicts established historical fact. Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate.


**12. With reference to the causes of the Rajput defeat by the Turkish armies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Turkish armies possessed superior weaponry compared to the Rajputs, leading to their decisive victories.
2. The fragmented political structure of the Rajput states, characterized by internal rivalries and lack of coordination, contributed significantly to their defeat.
3. The Rajputs' rigid adherence to caste systems hindered their military effectiveness and ability to mobilize a unified force against the Turks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text argues that the Turkish military advantage was not primarily due to superior weaponry but rather to organizational and social factors.  While the Turkish bows might have had a longer range, the text suggests Rajput weaponry was also quite effective.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly points out the weakness of the Rajput states' fragmented political structure, internal conflicts, and lack of coordination as key factors in their defeat.  This accurately reflects the political context of the time.

Statement 3 is largely incorrect. While the text acknowledges the role of social structures, it does not directly link the Rajput defeat to rigid adherence to caste systems hindering military effectiveness. The text emphasizes the lack of coordinated military organization as a more significant factor.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**13. With reference to the Mongol conquests in East Asia and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mongol conquests in China led to the unification of North and South China under a single rule for the first time.
2. The Sailendra dynasty, which ruled over the Srivijaya empire, maintained its dominance in Southeast Asia throughout the Mongol period.
3. The Kambuja empire, which extended over Cambodia and Annam, was significantly weakened by Mongol invasions and eventually collapsed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the Mongol conquests in China resulted in the unification of North and South China for the first time, highlighting a significant political achievement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text does not state that the Sailendra dynasty maintained its dominance throughout the Mongol period. While the text mentions the Srivijaya empire, it doesn't explicitly address its interaction with the Mongols.  The statement is unsupported.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions the Kambuja empire's flourishing but does not explicitly link its decline to Mongol invasions. The statement is an unsupported assumption.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**14. With reference to the three major empires of North India (800-1000 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala Empire's control extended over the entire Ganga valley, enabling them to dominate North India.
2. The Pratihara Empire's conflict with the Rashtrakutas centered primarily on the control of Kanauj and the upper Gangetic valley.
3. The Rashtrakuta Empire played a pivotal role in bridging North and South India economically and culturally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that no kingdom after Harsha's empire controlled the entire Ganga valley, contradicting the statement's assertion about the Pala Empire.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the conflict between the Pratihara and Rashtrakuta empires as primarily focused on the control of Kanauj and the upper Gangetic valley.  This accurately reflects the historical context of their rivalry.

Statement 3 is correct. The text highlights the Rashtrakuta Empire's role in bridging North and South India economically and culturally, emphasizing its importance in connecting the two regions.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) as a golden age for Bengali literature.  Many prominent Bengali writers flourished under his patronage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage highlights Alauddin Hussain Shah's liberal policy, appointing Hindus to high offices, including his wazir, chief physician, and head of the mint. This demonstrates religious tolerance, directly contradicting the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The text details Alauddin Hussain Shah's successful conquest of Kamata, achieved with the support of the Ahom kingdom, leading to the annexation of Kamata to Bengal.  His son was appointed governor of the newly acquired territory.  This clearly supports the statement.


**2. With reference to the political and military landscape of medieval Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmaputra valley, encompassing modern Assam, remained firmly under the control of the Delhi Sultanate throughout the medieval period.
2.  The Ahom kingdom, originating from a Mongoloid tribe in North Burma, gradually adopted Hindu religious practices.
3.  The Sultans of Bengal consistently maintained a peaceful and cooperative relationship with both the Kamata and Ahom kingdoms, avoiding any military conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that while Muslim rulers of Bengal attempted to conquer the Brahmaputra valley, they faced repeated defeats.  The valley was not under the consistent control of the Delhi Sultanate, let alone the Bengal Sultanate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the Ahom kingdom's origins and their subsequent Hinduization over time.  This shows a clear cultural shift and adoption of Hindu practices within the Ahom kingdom.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage describes conflicts between the Bengal Sultanate and both the Kamata and Ahom kingdoms.  The Bengal Sultans' attempts at conquest and the subsequent battles directly negate the claim of a peaceful and cooperative relationship.



**3. With reference to the interactions between the Bengal Sultanate and neighboring kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ganga dynasty of Orissa consistently maintained a strong military presence in South Bengal (Radha) and repeatedly launched successful campaigns against Lakhnauti.
2. The famous Puri temple and the Sun Temple (Konark) were constructed during the reign of the Gajapati dynasty of Orissa.
3.  The river Saraswati historically formed the boundary between Bengal and Orissa during the Sultanate period, with occasional border skirmishes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ganga dynasty of Orissa did engage with Radha (South Bengal) and even attempted to conquer Lakhnauti, the passage indicates that these attacks were *repulsed*, suggesting the Ganga dynasty did not maintain consistent military dominance in South Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text attributes the construction of the Puri temple and the Sun Temple (Konark) to the Ganga dynasty, not the later Gajapati dynasty. The Gajapati dynasty succeeded the Ganga dynasty.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that the river Saraswati served as the border between Bengal and Orissa, and that intermittent fighting occurred along this frontier.  The description of the border and skirmishes accurately reflects the statement.


**4. With reference to the Gujarat Sultanate under Ahmad Shah I, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital from Ahmedabad to Patan, a move that strengthened his control over the region.
2.  His architectural style, influenced by Jain traditions in Gujarat, was significantly different from the architectural styles prevalent in Delhi.
3.  Despite his destruction of Hindu temples, Ahmad Shah I included Hindus in his government, appointing them to ministerial positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that Ahmad Shah I *shifted* the capital from Patan *to* the newly founded city of Ahmedabad, not the other way around.  This reversal of the information makes the statement factually wrong.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly describes Ahmad Shah I's unique architectural style, drawing upon Jain traditions and differing significantly from the Delhi style. The description of the architectural features supports this statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage mentions that despite his actions against Hindu temples, Ahmad Shah I appointed Hindus, specifically Manik Chand and Motichand from the Bania community, to ministerial positions in his government. This shows a degree of religious pluralism.


**5. With reference to the rivalry between the Gujarat and Malwa Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  The kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa consistently allied against external threats, particularly from the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  Muzaffar Shah, the ruler of Gujarat, permanently subdued Malwa and installed his own nominee on the throne.
3.  The constant rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa weakened both kingdoms, preventing them from playing a more significant role in the broader politics of North India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly describes Gujarat and Malwa as *bitter rivals*, generally found on opposing sides in conflicts. This directly contradicts the assertion of consistent alliance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Muzaffar Shah did defeat and imprison Hushang Shah of Malwa, he later released him, reinstating him to the throne.  This shows a failure to permanently subdue Malwa and install a nominee.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage concludes that the intense rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa weakened both kingdoms, preventing them from having a greater influence on the broader political landscape of North India. This is a direct reflection of the statement.


**6. With reference to the early Mughal period under Babur, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's primary motivation for invading India was to escape the threat of the Uzbeks, seeking refuge and resources in the richer territories of India.
2.  Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab, consistently supported Babur in his conquest of India, providing crucial military assistance and resources.
3.  Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat (1526) immediately led to the complete consolidation of his rule over the entire Indian subcontinent.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage indicates that Babur's conquest of India was partly motivated by the limited resources of Kabul and the threat from the Uzbeks.  India was seen as a more lucrative and secure base.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Daulat Khan Lodi's support for Babur was inconsistent.  He initially attempted to conciliate Ibrahim Lodi, then later invited Babur's intervention, only to change sides again before the final conquest.  His actions were self-serving and unreliable.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Battle of Panipat was a significant victory, the passage mentions that Babur faced further battles against Rana Sanga and other Afghan rulers before consolidating his control over North India. His rule did not extend to the entire subcontinent immediately.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions that Akbar divided the empire into twelve subas in 1580, suggesting that these divisions were based on administrative and political considerations rather than purely geographical proximity.  The subas were strategically chosen.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy was multifaceted. While matrimonial alliances were a part of it, it also encompassed religious tolerance, the induction of Rajputs into Mughal service, and the granting of high ranks and responsibilities to Rajput leaders.  The description of the policy is more comprehensive.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the difficulty is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. With reference to the economic and social life under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate saw the widespread cultivation of rice, sugarcane, wheat, oilseeds, sesame, indigo, and cotton.
3.  The overwhelming majority of the population during the Delhi Sultanate comprised of prosperous landowners and village headmen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable insights into various aspects of life in the Delhi Sultanate, including products, roads, and the lives of some people, it doesn't provide a comprehensive picture of the economic conditions of the *ordinary* people. The historians of the period focused more on courtly events.  Statement 2 is correct as the text explicitly mentions the cultivation of the listed crops, highlighting the agricultural diversity of the Sultanate. Statement 3 is incorrect. While a prosperous section of owner-cultivators existed, the text clearly states that peasants formed the *overwhelming majority* of the population, indicating a largely agrarian society with varying levels of prosperity, not solely dominated by wealthy landowners and headmen.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between detailed descriptions and generalizations in historical accounts.


**2. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pargana, a sub-unit below the province (siq), was headed by a muqti responsible for remitting revenue to the center after meeting local expenses.
2.  Villages were traditionally grouped into units of 100 to 84, forming the basis of the pargana administration.
3. The village administration largely operated autonomously as long as land revenue was paid regularly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the *amil*, not the *muqti*, headed the pargana.  Muqtis were responsible for a larger administrative unit (Iqta) and their revenue practices involved a different system of remittance and auditing. Statement 2 is correct; the text explicitly mentions the traditional grouping of villages into units of 100 to 84 as the basis for pargana administration. Statement 3 is also correct; the passage indicates that village administration was largely left undisturbed as long as revenue obligations were fulfilled, implying a degree of autonomy.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the administrative hierarchy and the decentralized nature of village governance within the Sultanate.


**3. With reference to Alauddin Khalji's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures were primarily aimed at suppressing the power of Hindu traders.
2. Alauddin Khalji implemented a system of land revenue collection based on measuring cultivated land to ensure equitable taxation.
3. The fixed prices enforced by Alauddin Khalji on essential commodities remained unchanged even during periods of famine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Barani suggests this motivation, the text indicates that Alauddin's market controls impacted both Hindu and Muslim traders. The goal was broader economic stability and army provisioning, not solely targeting a specific religious group. Statement 2 is correct; Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms involved measuring cultivated land to ensure fair revenue assessment, preventing the wealthy from shifting the tax burden onto the poor.  Statement 3 is correct; the text emphasizes that prices were strictly controlled, even during famines, showcasing the Sultan's determination to maintain price stability.  This question tests factual recall, analytical skills in interpreting historical interpretations (like Barani's perspective), and understanding the rationale behind Alauddin's policies.


**4. With reference to the economic impact of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the silver tanka and copper dirham led to a decline in trade and urbanization.
2. The Delhi Sultanate witnessed the flourishing of urban economies, with Delhi and Daulatabad being major commercial centers.
3.  Bengal and Gujarat were renowned for their high-quality textiles, contributing significantly to the Sultanate's economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the establishment of a sound currency system based on the tanka and dirham contributed to the *growth* of trade, not its decline.  Statement 2 is correct.  The text highlights the economic prosperity and growth of towns like Delhi and Daulatabad as a result of increased trade. Statement 3 is also correct, as the text specifically mentions the reputation of Bengal and Gujarat for their fine fabrics, showcasing their contribution to the Sultanate's economy.  This question tests factual recall and an understanding of the relationship between currency, trade, and urban development during the Delhi Sultanate.


**5. With reference to the social structure and conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The majority of slaves were employed in agriculture, forming a significant portion of the rural workforce.
2.  Slavery existed in India before the arrival of the Turks, and the Delhi Sultanate adopted and expanded existing practices.
3.  The condition of slaves was universally harsh and devoid of any rights or opportunities for social mobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that a large number of slaves were used for *personal service* in towns, not primarily in agriculture.  Statement 2 is correct; the text acknowledges the pre-existing practice of slavery in India and the Sultanate's adoption and expansion of this system. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text notes that while slavery was considered degrading, slaves could marry and own some personal property, and manumission (granting freedom) was considered a meritorious act, indicating variations in treatment and some possibilities for social mobility.  This question tests factual recall and nuanced understanding of social structures and the complexities of slavery within the Delhi Sultanate.


**6. Consider the following statements about the administrative reforms of Alauddin Khalji:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's revenue measures were successfully enforced throughout his entire empire.
2. Alauddin Khalji abolished the powers of provincial governors to centralize control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although Alauddin aimed for empire-wide implementation, the passage suggests that his revenue measures were more effectively enforced in certain regions, particularly the Doab. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Alauddin sought to curb the power of provincial governors, the text does not explicitly state that he completely abolished their powers.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions land measurement as a key component, but other methods of revenue collection likely coexisted.  The question tests detailed factual recall and an understanding of the limitations and complexities of Alauddin Khalji's administrative reforms.


**7. With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad was primarily driven by a desire to better control South India.
2. The introduction of token currency was a complete failure, leading to immediate and widespread economic instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text suggests that the move to Daulatabad was motivated by strategic considerations, including better control over South India. Statement 2 is incorrect. The token currency experiment initially faced resistance and ultimately failed, but the text doesn't suggest *immediate* and *widespread* economic chaos. The government recovered, and Ibn Battuta's account confirms this. Statement 3 is correct.  Muhammad Tughlaq's military actions did reach beyond the Indus, indicating his ambitions in Central Asia. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall and analyze the multiple facets of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign, distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful policies and their impact.


**8. With reference to the economic policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Zabti system, also known as Todar Mal's bandobast, was a permanent and inflexible land revenue system.
2.  The Dahsala system calculated the state's share of the produce based on average prices over the last ten years.
3. Akbar's land revenue system offered peasants a choice between cash and kind payment, irrespective of crop type.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Zabti system, while based on meticulous measurement and assessment, wasn't permanent; the state retained the right to modify it. Statement 2 is correct; the Dahsala system used ten-year average prices for cash assessment of the state's share. Statement 3 is incorrect. The state preferred cash payment, and cash payments were mandatory for certain crops (cash crops). The question tests detailed knowledge of Akbar's land revenue system, emphasizing specific features and clarifying common misconceptions.


**9. With reference to the Mansabdari system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mansab system was a completely new invention of Akbar, with no historical precedents.
2.  The Dagh system involved branding horses to ensure the quality and quantity of cavalry maintained by Mansabdars.
3.  Akbar's Mansabdari system enforced strict racial segregation within the army's contingents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mansabdari system, while unique in its developed form, drew inspiration from earlier systems, particularly the Mongol military organization. Statement 2 is correct; the Dagh system involved branding horses to verify the quality and number of cavalry maintained by Mansabdars. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Akbar initially favored certain groups, the system later moved towards mixed contingents to promote unity and avoid parochialism.  The question tests knowledge of the Mansabdari system's origins, its components, and its broader aims within Akbar's administrative framework.


**10. With reference to the Mughal army during Shah Jahan's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal cavalry was entirely composed of Mansabdars, with no other types of troopers.
2.  The Ahadis were a highly trusted corps recruited directly by the emperors, receiving higher salaries than other troopers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Besides Mansabdars, the Mughal army included Ahadis and other troopers. Statement 2 is correct; Ahadis were a trusted corps directly recruited by the emperor and enjoyed higher salaries. Statement 3 is incorrect. European accounts highlight the poor organization and discipline of the Mughal infantry compared to their European counterparts.  This question tests detailed knowledge of Mughal military organization, highlighting the different components of the army and their relative strengths and weaknesses.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall beyond easily accessible information.


**1. With reference to the Ghaznavid Empire and its impact on North India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's conquest of the Punjab and Multan significantly altered the political landscape of North India, making deeper incursions into the Gangetic heartland possible for subsequent Turkic invaders.
2. Following Mahmud's death, the Seljuk Empire's rise diminished the Ghaznavids' power, shrinking their empire to Ghazni and the Punjab, significantly reducing their military threat to India.
3. The Ghaznavid raids, while initially devastating, ultimately spurred the rise of several new North Indian states capable of resisting further incursions, thus indirectly contributing to the fragmentation of political power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ghaznavid Empire's impact on North India.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the strategic importance of the Ghaznavid conquests of Punjab and Multan.  These victories breached India's northwestern defenses, paving the way for future invasions and significantly changing the political dynamics of the region.  Statement 2 accurately describes the weakening of the Ghaznavid Empire after Mahmud's death due to the rise of the Seljuks. This shift in power dynamics reduced the Ghaznavids’ ability to pose a consistent and serious military threat to India. Statement 3 correctly notes the indirect consequence of the Ghaznavid raids—the emergence of stronger, more unified North Indian states capable of resisting further invasions. This rise of new powers ultimately contributed to a more fragmented political landscape in North India.  There's no contradiction or ambiguity in the statements; they represent distinct but interconnected aspects of the historical narrative.


**2. With reference to the Rajput states and their political organization during the 11th and 12th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajput social structure, based on clans tracing descent from common ancestors, fostered a sense of brotherhood and egalitarianism, but also led to frequent inter-clan feuds hindering unified resistance against external threats.
2.  While most Rajput rulers were champions of Hinduism, some also patronized Jainism, demonstrating a degree of religious tolerance and pluralism within the Rajput political landscape.
3. The Rajput kingdoms, despite their internal conflicts, were primarily characterized by a highly centralized administrative structure with strong royal authority over land and resources, preventing the rise of powerful regional chieftains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of Rajput society and polity. Statement 1 correctly points out the dual nature of the clan-based Rajput organization. The strong sense of brotherhood and egalitarianism within clans often led to intense rivalries and feuds between different clans, making it difficult to forge lasting alliances and present a unified front against external enemies like the Ghaznavids. Statement 2 accurately notes the religious tolerance within Rajput kingdoms. While Hinduism was the dominant religion, patronage of Jainism and other faiths was not uncommon, showcasing a degree of religious pluralism. Statement 3, however, is incorrect. The Rajput administrative structure was not consistently centralized. While the *rana* or *rajar* held supreme authority, significant power often resided with regional chiefs and clan leaders, limiting the extent of centralized control and leading to internal power struggles.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in North India during the period between the 10th and 13th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style of temple architecture, characterized by tall, curved, spiral roofs over the *garbhagriha*, was primarily confined to the regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan.
2. The Chandela rulers, known for their patronage of art and architecture, are credited with building the magnificent temples at Khajuraho, showcasing the Nagara style in its most elaborate form.
3. The Lingaraja temple in Orissa, a prominent example of the Nagara style, displays a distinct regional variation, incorporating elements of Dravidian architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct, while statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 accurately attributes the construction of the Khajuraho temples to the Chandelas and correctly identifies the Nagara style as their dominant architectural choice.  The Khajuraho temples are indeed considered prime examples of the Nagara style's richness and complexity. Statement 3 is also correct; the Lingaraja temple in Orissa is a significant example of the Nagara style, but it does exhibit regional variations and incorporates elements that differ from the typical Nagara style found in other regions of North India.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Nagara style was not limited to Gujarat and Rajasthan; it was prevalent across a wider area of North India.


**4. With reference to the political history of Gujarat during the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahmad Shah I, the grandson of Muzaffar Shah, shifted the capital from Patan to Ahmedabad, laying the foundation for a new architectural style that blended Gujarat's Jain traditions with Islamic influences.
2. Mahmud Begarha, known for his military prowess and expansionist policies, conquered Girnar and Champaner, two strategically important forts, thus consolidating his control over Saurashtra and South Gujarat.
3.  Mahmud Begarha's reign saw a decline in trade and commerce due to his aggressive military campaigns and neglect of economic development, leading to widespread economic hardship within the kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate, whereas statement 3 is incorrect. Statement 1 accurately describes Ahmad Shah I's contributions to Gujarat's development and architectural heritage. He did indeed shift the capital to Ahmedabad and fostered a unique architectural style that combined elements of Jain and Islamic aesthetics.  The Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad stands as a testament to this architectural fusion. Statement 2 correctly highlights Mahmud Begarha's military achievements and expansionist policies. His conquest of Girnar and Champaner significantly strengthened his control over crucial regions of Gujarat. Statement 3 is incorrect. Mahmud Begarha's reign, despite his military focus, actually witnessed a flourishing of trade and commerce. He invested in infrastructure like caravan sarais, ensuring safe passage for traders and contributing to the kingdom's economic prosperity.


**5. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and its disintegration, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a highly influential minister in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces, each governed by a *tarafdar*.
2. The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration was primarily caused by internal conflicts between the Deccanis (long-established residents) and the Gharibs (newcomers), leading to the emergence of five independent sultanates.
3. Mahmud Gawan's patronage of learning and the establishment of a magnificent madrasa in Bidar contributed significantly to the cultural development and intellectual flourishing of the Bahmani kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bahmani kingdom's history and its eventual disintegration. Statement 1 correctly describes Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms. His reorganization of the kingdom into eight provinces with appointed *tarafdars* aimed to improve governance and efficiency. Statement 2 accurately explains the main cause of the Bahmani kingdom's fragmentation—the deep-seated conflict between the Deccanis and the Gharibs. This internal strife ultimately led to the emergence of five independent sultanates. Statement 3 accurately notes Mahmud Gawan's contribution to the cultural scene. His patronage of learning and the establishment of the madrasa in Bidar significantly boosted the kingdom's intellectual and cultural life.  The statements are all factually accurate and present a coherent picture of the Bahmani kingdom's rise and fall.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its relations with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's expansion under Harihara II included the conquest of significant territories on the eastern coast, bringing them into conflict with the Reddis, the rulers of Warangal, and the Bahmani Sultanate.
2.  Deva Raya I's marriage alliance with the Bahmani Sultanate, while initially securing peace, did not prevent future conflicts, particularly over control of the Krishna-Godavari delta.
3. The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565 marked the definitive end of the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to its immediate collapse and the complete eradication of its political influence in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate, while statement 3 is incorrect. Statement 1 accurately describes the expansionist policies of Harihara II and the resulting conflicts with neighboring powers. His push towards the eastern coast inevitably brought him into conflict with the already established kingdoms of the Reddis and the rulers of Warangal, as well as the ambitious Bahmani Sultanate.  Statement 2 correctly notes the temporary nature of the peace achieved through the marriage alliance under Deva Raya I. While the alliance temporarily eased tensions, it did not resolve the underlying conflicts over crucial territories like the Krishna-Godavari delta. Statement 3 is incorrect because, while the Battle of Bannihatti was a devastating blow, the Vijayanagara Empire did not collapse immediately. It continued to exist, albeit in a much weakened state, for several more decades.


**7. With reference to the Chola Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's conquests extended the Chola empire's reach to encompass the Pandya and Chera kingdoms, as well as Sri Lanka, showcasing the empire's significant naval power.
2. The Chola administration was characterized by a highly centralized system with minimal local self-governance, ensuring efficient control over all aspects of the empire's administration.
3. The Chola rulers' extensive use of temple inscriptions as a means of recording their achievements and administrative decrees provides invaluable insights into their history and governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct, while statement 2 is incorrect. Statement 1 accurately reflects Rajaraja Chola I's military successes and territorial expansions. His conquests significantly broadened the Chola Empire's reach, demonstrating the empire's strong naval capabilities.  The conquest of Sri Lanka, in particular, highlights this naval dominance. Statement 3 is also correct. The Chola rulers' extensive use of temple inscriptions provides an unparalleled source of information on their history, administrative practices, and societal structures. These inscriptions offer detailed accounts of their military campaigns, economic policies, and social organization. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Chola administration, while possessing a centralized structure, also incorporated significant elements of local self-governance, particularly at the village level.  The *sabha* and *ur* assemblies played a crucial role in managing village affairs.


**8. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate and its challenges, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate faced continuous challenges from rebellious governors in Bengal and Bihar, who repeatedly asserted their independence, weakening the Sultanate's control over eastern India.
2. The Mongol invasions posed a significant threat to the Delhi Sultanate, requiring substantial military resources and diverting attention from internal affairs, thus contributing to internal instability.
3.  The Rajput rulers, despite their internal conflicts, consistently presented a unified and powerful opposition to the Delhi Sultanate, preventing its expansion into Rajputana and hindering its consolidation of power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct, while statement 3 is incorrect. Statement 1 accurately describes the persistent challenges posed by rebellious governors in Bengal and Bihar. These regions frequently defied the Sultanate's authority, diverting resources and attention, and weakening the Sultanate's overall power. Statement 2 is also correct. The Mongol invasions created a significant threat to the Delhi Sultanate, necessitating the deployment of considerable military resources to defend against them. This constant pressure from the north weakened the Sultanate's ability to focus on internal consolidation and expansion into other regions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Rajput rulers, while often resisting the Sultanate's advances, did not present a unified and consistently powerful opposition.  Internal conflicts and rivalries among the Rajput states frequently hampered their ability to mount a coordinated and effective challenge to the Sultanate.

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule marked a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing during his reign.
2.  His administration was characterized by the restoration of law and order and a liberal policy that included appointing Hindus to high offices, including his wazir.
3.  His military campaigns successfully brought the entire Brahmaputra valley, including Kamata and the Ahom kingdom, under complete and lasting control of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, fostering the flourishing of several notable Bengali writers.  This highlights the Sultan's patronage of arts and culture and its impact on linguistic development.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text emphasizes Alauddin Hussain Shah's restoration of law and order and his liberal policy of appointing Hindus to high positions within his administration. This demonstrates a degree of religious tolerance and pragmatic governance, which is a crucial aspect for understanding the socio-political dynamics of the period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah did successfully conquer Kamata and annex it to Bengal,  his subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom was unsuccessful and repelled. This demonstrates the limitations of his military power and the resilience of the Ahom kingdom, a key factor often overlooked in broader narratives of Bengal's expansion.  The assertion of complete and lasting control over the Brahmaputra valley is therefore inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The independent Sultans of Bengal consistently succeeded in their attempts to bring the Brahmaputra Valley under their control, mirroring the earlier successes of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji.
2.  The Ahom kingdom, originally a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, adopted Hinduism and established a powerful kingdom in the 13th century, resisting attempts at subjugation by the Bengal Sultans.

This highlights the challenges of expanding into relatively unknown territories and the resistance encountered from established local powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Ahom kingdom's origins, its Hinduization, and its successful resistance against the expansionist ambitions of the Bengal Sultans.  This showcases the complex interplay between different cultural and political entities in medieval India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Karatoya River initially served as a boundary, the passage notes that the rulers of Kamata regained territory east of the river, and the situation was fluid and dynamic, not static as the statement implies.  This emphasizes the complexities and shifting power dynamics in the region.  


**3. With reference to the cultural and religious aspects of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the passage highlights Alauddin Hussain Shah's religious tolerance, it does not imply a complete absence of conflict or tension.  The complexities of inter-religious relations in medieval India are not fully captured by such an absolute assertion.  The existence of other conflicts and tensions, such as those related to territorial expansion, is implicit in the passage.


**4. With reference to the architectural styles of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The architectural style prevalent in Mandu, the capital of Malwa, was characterized by massive structures, often elevated on lofty plinths, and incorporated the extensive use of colored and glazed tiles.

3. The death of Rana Kumbha of Mewar led to a period of immediate and sustained stability in Mewar, allowing Rana Sanga to consolidate his power without significant internal conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly points out that the ongoing rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa weakened both kingdoms, preventing them from becoming major players in North Indian politics. This illustrates the detrimental effects of continuous conflict and the importance of internal stability for regional dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that Malwa was plagued by internal dissensions throughout the 15th century, which were frequently exploited by neighboring powers.  This contradicts the statement's assertion of consistent strength and its role as a constant barrier to its neighbors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The death of Rana Kumbha was followed by a period of significant internal conflict in Mewar, involving factionalism and struggles for succession before Rana Sanga eventually assumed power.  This highlights the challenges of succession and the fragility of power even within seemingly strong kingdoms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that Muhammad bin Tughlaq's experiment with token currency failed due to widespread forgery and devaluation, highlighting the challenges of implementing such novel economic policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage describes Muhammad bin Tughlaq's attempt to shift the capital as a failure, as it did not improve his control over South India and created significant logistical problems and discontent.  This demonstrates the potential pitfalls of ambitious but poorly planned administrative changes.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's conflict with the Bahmani Kingdom primarily centered on the Tungabhadra Doab, the Krishna-Godavari delta, and the Marathwada region.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  Harihara II did expand towards the eastern coast, but the passage indicates that the process involved conflicts and that complete control was not achieved. The statement oversimplifies a complex process of expansion and competition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya's reign is described as a high point, the passage makes it clear that conflicts continued, and the empire eventually faced its downfall after his death.  The statement's assertion of sustained peace and an unparalleled expansion with no further challenges is inaccurate.  The Portuguese threat and internal succession issues are mentioned as ongoing problems.


**9. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a significant figure in the Bahmani Kingdom, carried out internal reforms including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces and the standardization of salaries and obligations for nobles.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's attempts to resolve the internal strife between the Deccanis and foreigners within the Bahmani nobility were completely successful, leading to a period of lasting political stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

1.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital from Patan to Ahmedabad, laying the foundation of the new city in 1413.
2.  His architectural style, drawing on Jain traditions, featured slender turrets, exquisite stone carving, and ornate brackets, exemplified by the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly supports all three statements. The shift of the capital, the distinctive architectural style, and the simultaneous destruction of Hindu temples and employment of Hindu ministers are all explicitly mentioned.  This demonstrates the complex nature of Ahmad Shah I's rule, combining religious intolerance with pragmatic governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is accurate. Akbar’s use of matrimonial alliances and appointments of Rajput nobles to high ranks is well documented. Statement 2 is incorrect; Haldighati involved a mix of Rajput and Afghan forces against the Mughals, not a simple Hindu-Muslim conflict. Statement 3 is also false; the passage highlights Rana Pratap's relative isolation in his resistance to Akbar.  Most Rajput states had accepted Mughal suzerainty.


**6. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar abolished the jizya tax in 1564, as well as the pilgrim tax and the practice of forced conversions.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for Muslim theological discussions, was later opened to people of all faiths.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All three statements accurately reflect Akbar's religious policies as described in the provided text. The abolition of taxes and forced conversions is explicitly mentioned. The Ibadat Khana's evolution from a space for Muslim scholars to a multi-faith forum is also detailed. Finally, Akbar's declaration asserting his right to choose among Quranic interpretations, though not explicitly termed a "Decree of Infallibility," is described in the passage.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text confirms all three statements regarding Sikandar Lodi's reign.  His religious intolerance, his patronage of learning and translation efforts, and his founding of Agra are all clearly mentioned.

2.  Jahangir was the first Mughal emperor to recognize the Marathas' importance in the Deccan.
3.  The Mughal nobility under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb consisted predominantly of foreigners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The text provides the approximate percentage of Hindus in Akbar's nobility and mentions Jahangir's recognition of the Marathas' significance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text states that the nobility under Jahangir and Shah Jahan increasingly consisted of those born in India, and while foreigners continued to come, they were assimilated.

1.  Mughal nobles often invested in commercial ventures, including lending money on interest, despite Islamic prohibitions against usury.
2.  The Mughal nobility's economic activities were limited to land ownership and did not significantly influence trade and commerce.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1 and 3 are accurate reflections of the text. The involvement of nobles in commercial activities, including lending money and participation in trade, is described.  The participation of members of the royal family in commerce is also documented.

**1. With reference to Muhammad Tughlaq's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad primarily aimed to improve control over the Deccan and Gujarat, and provide access to western and southern ports.
2.  The introduction of token currency, mirroring experiments in China and Iran, aimed to alleviate a silver shortage but ultimately failed due to widespread counterfeiting.
3.  Military expeditions, such as the Khurasan project and the Qarachil expedition in the Kumaon hills, aimed at establishing a "scientific frontier" and controlling strategic trade routes, respectively, but resulted in significant military setbacks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Muhammad Tughlaq's ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful policies.  The relocation of the capital to Daulatabad (Deogir) was a multifaceted strategy. While aiming to control the Deccan and Gujarat, access to western and southern ports was also a significant motive.  The token currency experiment, though innovative for its time, suffered from a crucial flaw: the inability to effectively control counterfeiting. This, combined with the existing shortage of silver, led to its collapse. The military expeditions, while aiming to secure strategic frontiers and trade routes, were marked by logistical challenges and resulted in heavy losses, highlighting Tughlaq's often-hasty decision-making.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one of these crucial and factually accurate aspects of Tughlaq's reign.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the motivations behind Tughlaq's policies, as well as their consequences.


**2. With reference to the Mughal nobility under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy of incorporating Hindus into the nobility, predominantly Rajputs, initially involved a relatively small percentage (around 16% in 1594), but significantly increased their influence and power.
2.  The inclusion of Rajputs strengthened the nobility's aristocratic character, but simultaneously provided avenues for advancement to individuals from lower social strata, including Kayasthas and Khatris.
3.  The Mughal nobility under Akbar remained primarily composed of foreign elements (Iranis, Turanis), as evidenced by contemporary accounts, even with the inclusion of Hindus and Indian Muslims.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe Akbar's policies regarding the Mughal nobility.  While the initial percentage of Hindus was relatively small, their inclusion, especially Rajputs through strategic marriages and appointments, significantly increased their political power and influence within the empire.  The system simultaneously offered upward mobility to individuals from lower castes like Kayasthas and Khatris. Statement 3 is incorrect. While foreign elements were present, Akbar's policies actively promoted the integration of Indian Hindus and Muslims into the ruling class. Contemporary accounts, while sometimes exaggerating the foreign element, do not support the assertion that they remained the dominant group.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills in understanding the complexities of Akbar's policies towards the nobility.



**3. With reference to the economic and social life under the Mughals, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal economy experienced significant commercial expansion due to political integration, improved infrastructure (roads and sarais), and a standardized currency (the silver rupee).
2.  While the ruling classes prospered, the lives of peasants and workers remained largely unchanged, characterized by hardship and misery, reflecting a lack of trickle-down economic benefits.
3.  The Mughal ruling class actively embraced and promoted advancements in Western science and technology, contributing to India’s overall technological progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict the economic and social realities under the Mughals.  The Mughal empire's political unification and infrastructural improvements undeniably fostered commercial growth, aided by the standardized silver rupee.  However, the benefits of this expansion largely bypassed the peasantry and working class, whose lives continued to be marked by poverty and hardship, a crucial aspect often overlooked in discussions of Mughal prosperity.  Statement 3 is fundamentally incorrect. The Mughal ruling class, while engaging in extensive trade with Europeans, largely failed to adopt or adapt Western scientific and technological advancements. This technological stagnation would later prove to be a significant factor in India's vulnerability to European colonization. The question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the uneven distribution of economic benefits during the Mughal period.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  The crisis in the jagirdari system, exacerbated by the Deccan wars, led to a shortage of jagirs and increased pressure on the nobility, sometimes forcing them into private agreements with Maratha sardars.
2.  Aurangzeb's policies, including a virtual ban on new recruitment to conserve resources, led to dissatisfaction among the sons and sons-in-law of existing nobles vying for mansabs and jagirs.
3.  The decline of the Mughal nobility was primarily due to a cessation of immigration from Central Asia, weakening the "vivifying stream" of competent administrators and soldiers, as argued by some historians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the challenges faced by the Mughal nobility during Aurangzeb's reign.  The jagirdari system, the backbone of the Mughal military and administrative structure, faced a severe crisis due to Aurangzeb's Deccan wars and his policies. This shortage of jagirs and the resulting financial pressures led nobles to make compromises, even with their adversaries like the Marathas.  Aurangzeb's recruitment freeze further exacerbated the situation, causing resentment among the next generation of nobles waiting for appointments.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The decline of the Mughal nobility was not primarily due to a halt in Central Asian immigration.  By Aurangzeb's time, the nobility was largely composed of individuals born in India. The argument about Central Asian immigration is a historical misconception often used to justify colonial narratives.  This question tests factual recall, analytical skills, and the ability to differentiate between accurate and misleading historical interpretations.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Akbar's religious policies:**

1.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax, the pilgrim tax, and the practice of forcibly converting prisoners of war laid the foundation for a more inclusive empire based on religious tolerance.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for discussions among Muslim theologians, was later opened to people of all faiths, leading to broader religious debates but also generating controversies and rumors.
3.  Akbar's "Mazhar," a declaration asserting his right to interpret the Quran in cases of conflicting views among religious scholars, was essentially a "Decree of Infallibility," solidifying his religious authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) All three
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Akbar's religious policies.  The abolition of discriminatory taxes and practices was a cornerstone of his policy of religious tolerance, creating a more inclusive environment within the empire. The Ibadat Khana, while initially intended for Muslim scholars, became a space for interfaith dialogue, leading to both intellectual exchange and significant controversies among orthodox elements. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Akbar's Mazhar did not claim infallibility.  It asserted his right to choose among interpretations of the Quran when scholars disagreed, a claim based on his position as ruler and his commitment to the welfare of his subjects.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the nuances of Akbar's religious policies, differentiating between accurate and potentially misleading interpretations of his actions.

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate reflections of Mahmud Begarha's reign. Statement 1 correctly states his long rule and continuation of expansionist policies.  Statement 2 accurately describes his military successes against Idar and several Rajput states. However, Statement 3 is inaccurate. While the text mentions some Hindus in his government, it doesn't portray his policies as consistently marked by religious tolerance, pointing to his destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's policies. Statement 1 correctly assesses the intention and failure of the capital shift. Statement 2 correctly identifies the reason for the failure of the token currency experiment. However, Statement 3 is inaccurate. While the text mentions military campaigns reaching the Jhelum and beyond, it does not claim the establishment of *Mughal* control up to Peshawar.

2. Daulat Khan Lodi consistently supported Babur's ambitions in India, providing crucial military assistance.
3. The Battle of Panipat (1526) primarily involved Babur's artillery and the Ottoman tactic against Ibrahim Lodi's larger army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's capture of Bhira and Sialkot, strategically important gateways to Hindustan, significantly weakened Ibrahim Lodi's hold on the Punjab.  This success paved the way for Babur's subsequent advances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Daulat Khan Lodi's allegiance was fickle and opportunistic. While initially inviting Babur, he later switched sides, attempting to regain control of territories lost to Babur. His shifting alliances demonstrate the unstable political landscape of the time.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Battle of Panipat is notable for Babur's innovative use of artillery and the Ottoman (Rumi) tactical formation, which proved decisive against Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior but less strategically organized forces. While Babur's bowmen also played a significant role, the artillery and tactical formation were key to breaking the Lodi army.


**2. With reference to the reign of Babur, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur’s primary motivation for invading India was to acquire the vast wealth of the Delhi Sultanate.
2. The Rajput rulers unanimously supported Babur's invasion of India to overthrow Ibrahim Lodi.
3. The Battle of Khanwa (1527) was fought against Rana Sanga, who sought to expel Babur from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the wealth of India was a factor, Babur's motivations were multifaceted.  He sought a secure base of operations against the Uzbeks, and the weak political situation in Northwest India presented a ripe opportunity. The meagre resources of Kabul were a significant factor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Rajput rulers were divided in their response to Babur's invasion. Some, like Rana Sanga, initially saw Babur as a potential ally against Ibrahim Lodi but later opposed him. Others remained neutral or even supported Ibrahim Lodi.  There was no unified Rajput front against Babur.

Statement 3 is correct. The Battle of Khanwa was a crucial battle in which Babur decisively defeated Rana Sanga, who had assembled a large coalition of Rajput and Afghan forces to repel the Mughal advance. This victory solidified Babur's control over much of North India.


**3. With reference to Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 established a centralized, uniform administrative structure throughout his vast empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's division into twelve subas was a significant step towards administrative efficiency, it didn't lead to a completely uniform structure.  Local variations and challenges persisted. The administrative structure was based on checks and balances rather than complete uniformity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy was not solely based on matrimonial alliances. While these alliances were important for securing the loyalty of powerful Rajput rulers, Akbar also employed other strategies like granting high offices and integrating Rajput warriors into his army.  The policy was multifaceted.

Statement 3 is correct. The abolition of the jizya tax was a landmark decision demonstrating Akbar's policy of religious tolerance. It removed a discriminatory tax that had historically been a source of tension between Hindu and Muslim subjects.  This action was a key element in Akbar's efforts to build a more inclusive and harmonious society.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

It caused immense hardship and widespread discontent among the population due to the long distance and difficult conditions.  The intended improvement in administrative control over the south did not materialize.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The introduction of token currency was a major economic failure.  It led to widespread inflation and economic disruption due to widespread counterfeiting, which the government could not control. This experiment demonstrated a lack of understanding of the practical implications of monetary policy.

Statement 3 is correct. Muhammad Tughlaq's agrarian reforms, though well-intentioned, failed due to several factors including poor planning, inadequate implementation by corrupt officials, and the occurrence of a severe famine.  The reforms highlighted the challenges of implementing large-scale economic policies without adequate infrastructural support and honest officials.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to test factual recall, analysis, and understanding of the administrative, economic, and social structures of the Delhi Sultanate and related periods.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *pargana*, a sub-unit of the province, was headed by an official known as the *amil*, responsible for revenue collection at the local level.
2.  Villages were traditionally grouped into units of 100 or 84 households (*chaurasi*), forming the basis of the *pargana* administrative structure.
3. The *muqti*, responsible for a specific territory (*iqta*), was directly accountable to the central government for all revenue collected, irrespective of local expenditures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the *pargana* was headed by the *amil*, responsible for land revenue collection.  Statement 2 is also correct; the text mentions the traditional grouping of villages into units of 100 or 84 households as the foundation of the *pargana* system.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. While the *muqti* was responsible for revenue collection within their *iqta*, the text clarifies that towards the end of the Sultanate, Firuz Tughlaq relaxed the strict system of remitting the balance after meeting expenditures. The initial system was far more demanding than what statement 3 describes. The auditing process, while initially harsh, was not always a straightforward deduction of expenditure from revenue. The text highlights the complexity of the revenue system, making statement 3 an oversimplification.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of ordinary people, including prices of commodities and agricultural practices.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, evidenced by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay, which were significant centers of trade.
3.  The introduction of the silver *tanka* and copper *dirham* created a stable currency system, facilitating the growth of internal and external trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account provides valuable information on various aspects of Indian life, including products and some prices, it does not offer extensive details on the economic conditions of ordinary people. The text highlights that historians of the period focused more on courtly events. Statement 2 is correct; the text explicitly mentions the growth of major cities and their role in a flourishing urban economy.  Statement 3 is also correct. The establishment of a sound currency system based on the silver *tanka* and copper *dirham* is explicitly mentioned as a factor in the growth of trade.


**3. With reference to the social structure and life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Peasants formed the vast majority of the population, with a significant portion being subsistence farmers facing hardships due to recurring famines and wars.
2.  A prosperous section of the rural population consisted of owner-cultivators who dominated village panchayats and enjoyed a higher standard of life than ordinary peasants.
3.  Alauddin Khalji's policies aimed to uplift the economic condition of all peasants, irrespective of their social standing, by implementing stringent market controls and land revenue reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the text's description of peasant life during the Delhi Sultanate.  Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting the existence of a more prosperous section of owner-cultivators within the peasant class. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji did implement market controls and land revenue reforms, the text indicates these measures were primarily aimed at curbing the power of wealthy landowners (*khuts* and *mugaddams*) and ensuring a steady supply of food grains for the state and army, not necessarily at uplifting all peasants.  His policies, while impactful, were not designed to equally benefit all peasants.  The text emphasizes the harsh nature of these reforms and the resulting conflicts.


**4.  With reference to the policies of Firuz Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Tughlaq implemented policies to appease the nobility, the army, and the theologians, prioritizing the administration of areas easily controlled from the center.
2.  He successfully reasserted the Delhi Sultanate's authority over south India and the Deccan, reversing the trend of disintegration started during Muhammad Tughlaq's reign.
3.  His policy of making offices and *iqtas* hereditary, while initially successful in preventing rebellions, ultimately proved detrimental to the long-term efficiency and meritocracy of the administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects Firuz Tughlaq's approach to governance, prioritizing stability and control over territorial expansion. Statement 3 is also accurate; the text highlights that while his hereditary policy initially brought peace, it ultimately hampered the recruitment of competent individuals and led to the sultan's dependence on a narrow oligarchy.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Firuz Tughlaq did *not* attempt to reassert Delhi's authority over south India and the Deccan, accepting their independence.  His reign, while peaceful, was marked by the continued fragmentation of the empire.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the economic policies of Alauddin Khalji:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's market control measures were primarily aimed at punishing Hindu traders who allegedly engaged in profiteering.
2.  His land revenue reforms in the Doab region involved direct collection by the state, eliminating the *iqta* system and assessing revenue based on land measurement.
3.  The success of Alauddin Khalji's market controls and agrarian reforms led to a large and efficient cavalry, enabling him to repel Mongol attacks effectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While Barani suggests a motive of punishing Hindu traders, the text indicates that Alauddin's market controls affected both Hindu and Muslim traders.  Statement 2 is correct; Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms in the Doab involved direct state collection and measurement-based assessment. Statement 3 is also correct; the text directly links Alauddin's policies to the raising of a large, efficient cavalry and the successful defense against Mongol incursions.  The text emphasizes the importance of these reforms in strengthening the Sultanate's military capabilities.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempts to reclaim territories south of the Krishna River resulted in a stalemate, maintaining existing borders.
2.  Deva Raya II received tribute from rulers of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim, indicating Vijayanagara's significant influence.
3.  Nicolo Conti's account of Vijayanagara in 1420 described a vast city with a large army, highlighting its power and wealth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Deva Raya I's military campaigns to recover lost territories south of the Krishna River ended inconclusively, with both sides agreeing to maintain the existing frontiers. This highlights the limitations of Vijayanagara's power despite its strength.  Statement 3 is also correct.  Nicolo Conti's account, as cited in the text, provides a detailed and impressive description of Vijayanagara's size, military strength, and the power of its king. This account corroborates the empire's significant influence in the region.  However, statement 2 requires careful analysis. While the text mentions Deva Raya II receiving tribute, it also expresses doubt about the regularity and extent of this tribute, particularly from Pegu and Tenasserim. The tribute may have been occasional gifts or symbolic gestures rather than consistent payments.  Therefore, statement 2 is not entirely accurate. The assertion of tribute needs to be qualified. The other options are incorrect because they either include the inaccurate statement 2 or omit the accurate statements 1 and 3.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign was marked by significant Hindu participation in the administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's leadership expanded the Bahmani Kingdom's territory, including the conquest of western coastal areas like Dabhol and Goa.
3.  The Bahmani Kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five independent principalities: Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bahmani Kingdom's history. Statement 1 correctly points out Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of including Hindus in the administration, particularly in revenue administration, a significant departure from typical Sultanate practices. This policy aimed at creating a balance against foreign influence and utilizing the expertise of the local population. Statement 2 accurately describes Mahmud Gawan's significant contributions to the kingdom's expansion, particularly his military successes on the western coast which significantly impacted Vijayanagara's trade.  His administration also led to internal reforms, improving the kingdom's efficiency and stability.  Statement 3 correctly summarizes the ultimate fate of the Bahmani Kingdom, its fragmentation into five successor states that continued to be significant players in Deccan politics for centuries.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of all three statements.  These statements highlight the Bahmani Kingdom's complex internal dynamics and its lasting impact on the Deccan region.


**3. With reference to the reign of Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's military campaigns resulted in the restoration of Vijayanagara territories up to the Krishna River and a decisive victory against Bijapur.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya is known for his contributions to Telugu and Sanskrit literature and his patronage of poets from various South Indian languages.
3.  Foreign accounts describe Krishna Deva Raya's reign as characterized by efficient administration, prosperity, and religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of Krishna Deva Raya's reign. Statement 1 correctly depicts his significant military achievements, including recovering territories up to the Krishna River and decisively defeating Bijapur.  This restored Vijayanagara's dominance in the region after a period of internal strife and external challenges. Statement 2 highlights his literary contributions and patronage.  The text mentions his literary works in Telugu and Sanskrit and his support for poets from different South Indian languages, showcasing his role in cultural advancement. Statement 3 accurately reflects the views of foreign travelers who described his rule as efficient, prosperous and marked by religious tolerance.  Accounts from Barbosa, Paes, and Nuniz, as mentioned in the text, support this assessment. The other options are incorrect because they fail to encompass the totality of Krishna Deva Raya's achievements and the accuracy of the three statements. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific ruler's achievements across military, literary, and administrative domains.


**4. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The death of Aurangzeb marked a period of rapid decline, characterized by factional fighting among nobles and the rise of independent provincial governors.
2.  Aurangzeb's policies, particularly his Deccan campaigns, significantly weakened the empire's resources and contributed to its decline.
3.  Economic factors, including slow growth in agricultural and industrial production, and rising prices, contributed to the Mughal Empire's weakening.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the Mughal Empire's decline. Statement 1 accurately describes the immediate consequences of Aurangzeb's death, emphasizing the internal instability that followed. The ensuing factionalism among nobles and the emergence of independent provincial governors directly undermined the empire's authority and centralized control. Statement 2 rightly points to Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns as a major factor in the empire's weakening. The prolonged and costly wars drained the empire's resources, both financially and militarily, leaving it vulnerable to internal and external pressures. Statement 3 correctly identifies economic factors that contributed to the empire's decline. Slow growth in agricultural and industrial production, coupled with rising prices, created widespread economic hardship and social unrest, further destabilizing the empire.  The other options are incomplete, failing to account for the multifaceted nature of the decline and the interplay of political, military, and economic factors.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the complex reasons behind the Mughal Empire's decline.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the length constraints of the prompt and the complexity of creating high-quality, difficult questions, the number of questions generated will be limited.  Each question attempts to incorporate multiple cognitive skills and plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara kingdom was divided into Rajyas or Mandalams (provinces), further subdivided into Nadus (districts), Sthalas (sub-districts), and Gramas (villages).
2.  The provincial governors, initially royal princes, later included vassals and nobles, enjoyed significant autonomy, including the right to issue their own coinage.
3.  Village self-government, inherited from the Cholas, remained largely unaffected by the Vijayanagara system, retaining its independence and initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the hierarchical administrative structure of the Vijayanagara Empire, mirroring a common pattern in South Indian kingdoms.  The division into provinces, districts, and villages facilitated efficient governance and revenue collection.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While initially held by royal princes, the provincial governorships were later bestowed upon members of vassal families and nobles. This decentralized structure granted governors considerable autonomy in local administration, including the right to mint low-denomination coins.  This reflects a balance between centralized control and regional autonomy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Chola traditions of village self-government were considerably weakened under Vijayanagara rule. The rise of hereditary Nayakships curtailed the freedom and initiative of villages, illustrating a shift in power dynamics.  This demonstrates a key aspect of Vijayanagara governance.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The land tax in Vijayanagara varied according to crop type, soil quality, and irrigation methods, with kuruvai rice taxed at one-third of the produce.
2.  Besides land tax, the Vijayanagara kingdom imposed taxes on property, sales, professions, marriages, and levied military contributions during emergencies.
3.  The Vijayanagara peasantry generally enjoyed a high standard of living, reflected in their well-constructed houses and ample access to luxury goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the differentiated land tax system in Vijayanagara. The varying rates based on crop type, soil, and irrigation methods demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of agricultural economics.  The specific example of kuruvai rice taxation further substantiates this.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text clearly mentions a range of taxes beyond land revenue, including those on property, sales, professions, and marriages, along with emergency military levies. This diversified taxation system is a hallmark of many medieval kingdoms.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text portrays the peasantry as having a relatively modest standard of living, characterized by thatched houses and limited clothing.  While the upper classes enjoyed luxury, this stark contrast highlights the significant economic disparity within the kingdom. The statement misrepresents the socioeconomic reality of the peasantry.



**3. With reference to the political relationships of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara emperors maintained control over vast territories through direct administration in some areas and through subordinate rulers in others.
2.  The Nayakas or Palegars, military chiefs granted land (gmaram) by the king, formed a powerful section, sometimes challenging central control.
3. The Vijayanagara Empire maintained peaceful, cooperative relationships with all its neighboring kingdoms, avoiding conflict and maintaining stable borders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the dual approach of the Vijayanagara Empire to maintaining control over its vast territories.  Direct administration was implemented in core regions, while defeated but restored rulers were allowed to govern their territories under Vijayanagara suzerainty. This strategy reflects a pragmatic approach to managing a large and diverse empire.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  The Nayakas, powerful military chiefs granted land in return for military service, frequently wielded significant influence and occasionally challenged the central authority. Their power and potential for rebellion represent a significant internal challenge to Vijayanagara stability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text highlights the frequent conflicts between Vijayanagara and its neighbors, particularly the Bahmani Sultanate and the kingdom of Orissa.  These conflicts, coupled with internal tensions, ultimately contributed to the decline and fall of the empire. The statement ignores the significant military conflicts that characterized Vijayanagara's external relations.


**4. With reference to the reign of Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign is considered a golden age in Telugu literature, marking a shift from Sanskrit imitation to independent works.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's book on polity emphasizes the king's role in protecting the good and punishing the wicked, while advising moderate taxation.
3. Krishna Deva Raya successfully maintained a strong navy which enabled him to extract tribute from distant kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the flourishing of Telugu literature during Krishna Deva Raya's rule. His patronage fostered the creation of original Telugu works, marking a significant cultural shift.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Krishna Deva Raya's treatise on polity emphasizes the king's responsibilities, including just governance and moderate taxation, reflecting a balanced approach to kingship.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the text mentions that some kingdoms paid tribute to Deva Raya II, there is no mention of Krishna Deva Raya having a strong navy or of him receiving tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim.  The statement incorrectly attributes naval power and tribute collection to Krishna Deva Raya.  The text suggests that he may have neglected naval development compared to previous rulers.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to Akbar's reign and its impact on Northwest India, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 facilitated trade along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab.
2. The death of Abdullah Uzbek in 1598 marked the end of the Uzbek threat to the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier.
3. Raja Birbal's death during an expedition against rebellious tribesmen in the Khyber Pass significantly hampered Akbar's efforts to secure the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text explicitly states that Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 opened up trade routes down the Indus River, directly benefiting Punjab. This demonstrates Akbar's strategic understanding of linking military conquest with economic advantage.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage clearly indicates that Akbar's stay in Lahore until 1598 was directly linked to the threat posed by Abdullah Uzbek.  His death finally removed this significant external threat to the northwestern frontier of the empire.  This highlights Akbar's long-term strategic planning and his ability to manage external threats.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Raja Birbal did indeed die during an expedition in the Khyber Pass, the text doesn't suggest that his death significantly hampered Akbar's overall efforts to secure the northwest.  The passage emphasizes that the Afghan tribesmen were *gradually* forced to submit, implying that Akbar's strategy was successful despite the loss of Birbal.  This underscores the resilience of Akbar's military and administrative strategies.  The death of a single, albeit important, figure didn't derail the broader campaign.


**2. With reference to Akbar's religious policies and the Ibadat Khana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana initially included only Muslim theologians and mystics, leading to disorderly debates that displeased Akbar.
2.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and pilgrim tax was a precursor to his more inclusive approach at the Ibadat Khana.
3. The Ibadat Khana's expansion to include people of all faiths led to widespread praise and strengthened Akbar's image as a religiously tolerant ruler.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the initial phase of the Ibadat Khana. The text describes the initial meetings as disorderly and marked by wrangling among Muslim scholars, which ultimately led Akbar to broaden the discussions. This demonstrates Akbar’s initial approach and subsequent shift in strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's early actions of abolishing the jizya and pilgrim taxes were significant steps towards religious tolerance, setting the stage for the more inclusive environment he later fostered in the Ibadat Khana. This shows a clear progression in Akbar's religious policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Ibadat Khana, despite its inclusive nature, brought "growing discredit" to Akbar rather than strengthening his image universally.  Various interpretations of Akbar's actions led to rumors and dissent among religious groups. This illustrates the complexity of Akbar's religious policies and their reception by different segments of the population.  The Ibadat Khana's impact was not uniformly positive.


**3. With reference to the administrative and cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, known as "Friend of the Poor," composed the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a book of songs set to various ragas.
2.  The Charminar, built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, is known for its four minarets, each 48 meters high.
3.  The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, built in 1660, features the largest single dome ever constructed and is renowned for its acoustics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements are supported by the provided text. Statement 1 correctly identifies Ibrahim Adil Shah II's title, his interest in music, and his authorship of *Kitizb-i-Nawras*.  This highlights the Sultan's patronage of arts and culture.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Charminar and its key features, including the height of its minarets. This showcases the architectural achievements of the Golconda Sultanate.

Statement 3 correctly describes the Gol Gumbaz and its unique acoustic properties, along with the accurate construction date. This underscores Bijapur's architectural prowess and innovation.  The accurate details in all three statements demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of Deccan cultural contributions.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of North India during the 15th and early 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Khanwa (1527) between Babur and Rana Sanga resulted in the death of Rana Sanga on the battlefield.
2. Mahmud Khalji of Malwa, known for his ambition, engaged in conflicts with various neighbors, including the rulers of Gujarat and Mewar.
3.  The Jauhar ceremony, where Rajput women immolated themselves to avoid capture, occurred during the Mughal siege of Chanderi under Babur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rana Sanga was decisively defeated at Khanwa, the text states he escaped and was subsequently poisoned by his own nobles. This demonstrates the political complexities and internal rivalries within Rajput states.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly details Mahmud Khalji's ambitious nature and his involvement in numerous conflicts with his neighbors, including Gujarat and Mewar. This illustrates the volatile political environment of the time.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions the Rajput women of Chanderi performing Jauhar during its capture by Babur's forces. This highlights the desperate measures taken by Rajput communities to resist Mughal conquest and uphold their honor.  The accuracy of statements 2 and 3, contrasted with the inaccuracy of statement 1, highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding this period.


**5. With reference to the reign of Jahangir and its impact on Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rebellion of Khusrau, Jahangir's eldest son, was a brief affair, quickly quelled by Jahangir near Lahore.
2.  Islam Khan, appointed governor of Bengal, effectively suppressed the Afghan rebellion and established Dacca as the provincial capital.
3.  Jahangir's policy in Bengal focused solely on military conquest, disregarding the need to secure the goodwill of the local population.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly mentions that Khusrau's rebellion was short-lived, ending with his capture and imprisonment after a battle near Lahore. This illustrates the challenges faced by Jahangir even after a relatively peaceful succession.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage details Islam Khan's successful campaign against the Afghan rebels in Bengal and the subsequent shift of the provincial capital to Dacca. This demonstrates Jahangir's effective administrative response to rebellion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Jahangir initially focused on military action, the text explicitly states that he later understood the importance of securing the goodwill of the people, treating defeated Afghan chiefs with consideration and releasing many prisoners.  This shows a nuanced approach combining military might with political pragmatism. The statement misrepresents Jahangir's overall strategy in Bengal.

The passage highlights discontent among officials and tribes under Ibrahim Lodi's rule as a significant factor driving invitations to Babur.  A high-ranking official in Punjab harboring resentment towards the ruler's policies fits this narrative perfectly. Options (a), (b), and (c) present specific familial relationships and grievances, none of which are explicitly mentioned in relation to Alam Khan. The UPSC often tests the ability to infer information from the given context, and option (d) represents the most logical deduction based on the available details. The other options present plausible but ultimately unsubstantiated claims about specific individuals and their grievances.


**2. The battle of Dharmat was fought between:**

(a) Muhammad Ghori and Jai Chand
(b) Babur and Afghans
(c) Aurangzeb and Dara Shukoh
(d) Ahmad Shah Durrani and the Marathas

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question specifically asks about the Battle of Dharmat.  Option (a), Muhammad Ghori and Jai Chand, correctly identifies the combatants of this significant historical battle. The other options list other important battles but not the Battle of Dharmat.  Option (b) refers to various battles fought by Babur against Afghan forces during his conquest of India.  Option (c) pertains to the conflict between Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh for the Mughal throne. Option (d) describes a battle between Ahmad Shah Durrani and the Marathas, a later event in Indian history.  The accuracy of option (a) is crucial for understanding the broader context of the early Turkish invasions of India and the establishment of the Ghurid Empire. The other options represent battles occurring in different periods and involving different rulers, demonstrating the importance of precise historical knowledge.


**3. The motive behind Shah Jahan’s Balkh campaign was to:**

(a) Secure a friendly ruler in Balkh and Badakshan which bordered Kabul
(b) Conquer Samargand and Ferghana, the Mughal homelands
(c) Fix the Mughal frontier on the ‘scientific line’ the Amu Daria
(d) Expand the Mughal Empire beyond the sub-continent

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While Shah Jahan's ambitions might have included elements of options (b), (c), and (d), the primary motive behind the Balkh campaign, as described in the provided text, was to secure a friendly ruler in Balkh and Badakhshan. These regions were strategically important because of their proximity to Kabul, a key area for the Mughal Empire.  Options (b), (c), and (d) present plausible but secondary objectives. The conquest of Samarkand and Ferghana (option b) was a long-standing Mughal aspiration, but it wasn't the immediate goal of the Balkh campaign.  Similarly, establishing a defined frontier along the Amu Darya (option c) was a strategic consideration but not the primary driver.  Expanding beyond the subcontinent (option d) was a broader imperial goal, but the Balkh campaign was a regional initiative primarily focused on border security and regional influence. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the nuances of Mughal foreign policy and the specific strategic context of the Balkh campaign.


**4. Which among the following ports was called Babul Mecca (Gate of Mecca) during the Mughal Period?**

(a) Calicut
(b) Bharuch
(c) Cambay
(d) Surat

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Surat, option (d), is correctly identified as the port known as Babul Mecca (Gate of Mecca) during the Mughal period.  This designation highlights its significant role as a major port for pilgrims traveling to Mecca. The other options represent other important ports in India during the Mughal era, but they didn't hold the same religious and symbolic significance as Surat. Calicut (option a) was a prominent port on the Malabar Coast, Bharuch (option b) was an ancient port on the Narmada River, and Cambay (option c) was a major trading center in Gujarat. However, none of these were specifically known as the "Gate of Mecca." This question tests knowledge of Mughal-era trade and the religious importance of specific ports. The correct answer shows familiarity with the unique role of Surat in facilitating pilgrimage.


**5. Which one of the following Muslim rulers was hailed as the ‘Jagadguru’ by his Muslim subjects because of his belief in secularism?**

(a) Hussain Shah
(b) Zain-ul-Abidin
(c) Ibrahim Adil Shah
(d) Mahmud II

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur is correctly identified as the ruler who earned the title 'Jagadguru' due to his secular policies. This title, usually associated with Hindu religious leaders, reflects his inclusive approach and respect for diverse religious communities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other Muslim rulers, but the text doesn't associate them with the 'Jagadguru' title or a similar level of secularism.  The question assesses knowledge of the religious tolerance and policies of various Muslim rulers in India. The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the specific context of Ibrahim Adil Shah II's reign and his unique position in promoting religious harmony.


**6. Who among the following streamlined the Maratha administration after Shambhaji?**

(a) Rajaram
(b) Balaji Viswanath
(c) Ganga Bai
(d) Nanaji Deshmukh

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Balaji Viswanath is accurately identified as the individual who significantly streamlined the Maratha administration after the death of Shambhaji. He played a crucial role in restructuring the administrative system and strengthening the Maratha state. Rajaram (a), Ganga Bai (c), and Nanaji Deshmukh (d) were all significant figures in Maratha history, but they did not play the primary role in reforming the administration post-Shambhaji. The question tests knowledge of Maratha political history and administrative reforms. The correct answer demonstrates understanding of Balaji Viswanath's pivotal role in shaping the Maratha state.


**7. Match List-I with List-II and select the correct answer using the codes given below the lists:**

List-I:
A. Iqta  1. Marathas
B. Jagir 2. Delhi Sultans
C. Amaram 3. Mughals
D. Mokasa 4. Vijayanagar

Code:
A B C D
(a) 3 2 1 4
(b) 2 3 4 1
(c) 2 3 1 4
(d) 3 2 4 1

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct matching is: A (Iqta) - 2 (Delhi Sultans), B (Jagir) - 3 (Mughals), C (Amaram) - 1 (Marathas), D (Mokasa) - 4 (Vijayanagara). This question assesses knowledge of different land revenue systems prevalent in various historical periods and empires in India.  Iqta was a land grant system under the Delhi Sultanate, Jagir was a similar system under the Mughals, Amaram was a land tenure system in the Maratha Empire, and Mokasa was a land grant system in the Vijayanagara Empire.  The correct answer shows a clear understanding of the different land revenue systems and their association with specific historical periods.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

Assertion (A): During the time of Akbar, for every ten cavalrymen, the mansabdars had to maintain twenty horses.

Reason (R): Horses had to be rested while on March and replacements were necessary in times of war.

Code:
(a) Both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
(b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not a correct explanation of (A).
(c) (A) is true, but (R) is false.
(d) (A) is false, but (R) is true.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).  Akbar's mansabdari system required mansabdars to maintain a certain number of horses, exceeding the number of cavalrymen.  This was primarily due to the need to rotate horses during campaigns to ensure sufficient strength and stamina for battles and long marches.  The assertion accurately reflects the system's requirements, while the reason provides the logical basis for those requirements. The correct option demonstrates an understanding of the Mughal military organization and the logistical considerations behind the mansabdari system.


**9. Consider the following statements: Aladis were those troopers who:**

1. offered their services singly
2. did not attach themselves to any chief
3. had the emperor as their immediate colonel
4. attached themselves to Mirzas

Which of these statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 3 and 4 are correct
(b) 1, 2 and 3 are correct
(c) 2 and 3 are correct
(d) 1 and 4 are correct

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct statements are 1, 2, and 3.  Aladis were independent troopers who offered their services directly to the emperor, without being attached to any specific noble or commander.  This is reflected in statements 1, 2, and 3. Statement 4 is incorrect as Aladis were not associated with Mirzas. The question tests knowledge of Mughal military organization and the different types of troops employed.  The correct answer demonstrates familiarity with the unique characteristics of Aladis within the Mughal army structure.


**10. The loss of Qandahar was a big blow to the Mughal empire from the viewpoint of:**

(a) Natural resources
(b) Buffer territory
(c) Communication
(d) Strategic stronghold

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Qandahar's loss was primarily a strategic blow to the Mughal Empire.  It served as a crucial stronghold on the northwestern frontier, safeguarding the empire from external threats. While it might have offered some natural resources and played a role in communication, its primary significance lay in its strategic location as a defensive buffer.  The other options, while not entirely irrelevant, do not capture the primary strategic significance of Qandahar. This question tests understanding of Mughal geopolitics and the strategic importance of specific territories. The correct answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the strategic ramifications of losing Qandahar.


**UPSC Style MCQs based on Target Content:**

**11. With reference to Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquests of Kashmir, including Ladakh and Baltistan, were primarily aimed at securing the trade routes to Central Asia.
2. The death of Raja Birbal during an expedition against rebellious tribesmen in the Khyber Pass marked a turning point in Akbar's Northwest Frontier policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of events and their consequences during Akbar's reign.  Statement 1 correctly highlights that securing control over Kashmir, Ladakh, and Baltistan was crucial for blocking potential threats from the Uzbeks and securing trade routes. Statement 2 accurately notes the significance of Raja Birbal's death in the Khyber Pass, but it's not necessarily a "turning point" in the broader sense; however, it reflects the challenges involved in securing the Northwest Frontier. Statement 3 correctly points out that the conquest of Sindh and the resulting control over the Indus River significantly boosted trade for the Punjab region.  The question tests knowledge of Akbar's military campaigns and their economic and strategic implications.  The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the interconnectedness of military actions, trade, and regional development under Akbar's rule.



**12. With reference to Akbar's administrative and cultural policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax aimed primarily to foster religious harmony and promote social equity.
2. The Ibadat Khana, initially intended for religious discussions among Muslim theologians, eventually evolved into a space for interfaith dialogue.
3. Akbar's policy of incorporating able Hindus into the nobility was solely motivated by political expediency and consolidating his power.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Akbar's policies. The abolition of the jizya tax was a significant step towards religious tolerance and equality, although it also had political implications. The Ibadat Khana's evolution from a space for Muslim theological discussions to interfaith dialogue reflects Akbar's growing interest in religious pluralism.  Statement 3 is incorrect because Akbar's policy of incorporating Hindus into the nobility was not *solely* motivated by political expediency. While political gains were undoubtedly a factor, his genuine interest in religious harmony and his personal relationships with Hindu nobles also played significant roles. The question assesses the multiple facets of Akbar's policies and their motivations. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of Akbar's multifaceted approach to religious and political integration.



**13. With reference to the Mughal Empire's expansion under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Man Singh's conquests in the east extended Mughal control to Dacca and other parts of East Bengal.
2. Mirza Aziz Koka's conquest of Kathiawar marked the beginning of significant Mughal expansion into the Deccan.
3. Akbar's consolidation of the Northwest Frontier involved both military campaigns and diplomatic efforts to secure a scientific frontier for the empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Raja Man Singh's conquests significantly expanded Mughal influence into East Bengal. Akbar's Northwest Frontier policy involved a combination of military campaigns and diplomatic initiatives to create a secure and stable border.  Statement 2 is incorrect because Mirza Aziz Koka's conquest of Kathiawar was in the west, not the Deccan.  The Mughal expansion into the Deccan happened later and involved different campaigns and personalities.  This question tests knowledge of Akbar's territorial expansion and the specific contributions of various generals. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the geography and chronology of Akbar's conquests.


**14. With reference to the Mughal-Persian relations during Shah Jahan's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's Balkh campaign was primarily aimed at securing a friendly ruler in Balkh and Badakhshan to stabilize the Kabul region.
2. The loss of Qandahar to the Persians was a significant blow to Mughal prestige and prompted multiple unsuccessful attempts to recapture it.
3. Shah Jahan's foreign policy was primarily focused on aggressive expansion beyond the Northwest Frontier, leading to numerous conflicts with neighboring empires.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect the dynamics of Mughal-Persian relations during Shah Jahan's reign.  The Balkh campaign was indeed focused on securing a friendly ruler to stabilize the Kabul region.  The loss of Qandahar and the subsequent attempts to recapture it represent a significant event in Mughal foreign policy. Statement 3 is incorrect; Shah Jahan's foreign policy wasn't primarily focused on aggressive expansion beyond the Northwest Frontier. While there were conflicts, his policy was more nuanced, involving a mix of diplomacy and military action aimed at maintaining stability on the frontier and protecting existing territories. The question assesses understanding of Mughal foreign policy and its regional context. The correct answer demonstrates a grasp of the complexities of Mughal relations with Persia and the strategic considerations involved.


**15. With reference to the Deccan and its interactions with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deccani states' expansionist policies in the south, particularly after the 1636 treaties with the Mughals, led to the weakening of their internal cohesion.
2. The rise of the Marathas as a significant force in Deccan politics predates the significant Mughal involvement in the region.
3. The cultural contributions of the Deccani states include significant advancements in music, literature, architecture, and painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Deccan history and its relationship with the Mughal Empire. The expansionist policies of the Deccani states did lead to internal instability as ambitious nobles sought greater power. The Marathas had already emerged as a significant power in the Deccan even before the Mughals became heavily involved in the region. The Deccani states made notable contributions to various art forms. The question tests knowledge of Deccan history, its internal dynamics, and its cultural contributions. The correct answer shows a comprehensive understanding of Deccan's political and cultural landscape.


**16. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's initial approach to the Deccan involved a combination of military pressure and diplomatic efforts to secure the submission of Bijapur and Golconda.
2. The capture of Bijapur and Golconda marked the end of significant resistance in the Deccan against the Mughal Empire.
3. Aurangzeb's execution of Sambhaji was a tactical success that effectively ended the Maratha resistance to Mughal rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Aurangzeb's early Deccan policy involved a mixture of military and diplomatic strategies.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect because the capture of Bijapur and Golconda did not end all Deccan resistance, and the execution of Sambhaji, while a significant event, did not effectively end the Maratha resistance; instead, it intensified it. This question assesses the complexities of Aurangzeb's Deccan policy and its outcomes. The correct answer demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the challenges Aurangzeb faced in the Deccan and the long-term consequences of his actions.


**17. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal nobility under Akbar included a significant proportion of Hindus, primarily Rajputs, who held high mansabs and wielded considerable influence.
2. The mansabdari system, while providing high salaries, also entailed significant expenses for the nobles, leading many into debt.
3. The Mughal nobility, despite its diversity, remained largely a cohesive and unified group with little internal conflict or competition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Mughal nobility.  Akbar's policy did incorporate a significant number of Hindu nobles, especially Rajputs. The mansabdari system, while offering high salaries, also involved substantial expenses, often leading nobles into debt.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Mughal nobility was not entirely cohesive. There were frequent internal conflicts, rivalries, and power struggles among different groups within the nobility. The question tests knowledge of the Mughal nobility's composition, its economic aspects, and its internal dynamics. The correct answer demonstrates an awareness of the complexities of the Mughal nobility's structure and functioning.


**18. With reference to the later Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal administration, despite setbacks in the Deccan, retained considerable strength and vigor in northern India, particularly at the district level.
2. The Mughal dynasty, even after Aurangzeb's death, retained a significant hold on the imagination and loyalty of the people throughout India.
3. The decline of the Mughal Empire was primarily due to Aurangzeb's religious policies, which alienated both Hindus and Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. While the Mughal Empire faced challenges in the Deccan, its administration in northern India remained relatively strong, particularly at the local level.  Statement 2 is partially true; the Mughal dynasty did retain some influence, but it was not a "significant hold" across all of India.  Statement 3 is an oversimplification. Aurangzeb's religious policies contributed to the decline, but it was a complex process involving multiple economic, political, and social factors that were far more significant in the long run.  This question assesses the reasons for the Mughal Empire's decline.  The correct answer demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the complex factors leading to the empire's downfall and avoids oversimplifying the historical narrative.


**19. With reference to Akbar's daily routine and administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's appearance at the jharoka darshan allowed him to connect directly with his people and receive petitions.
2. The twelve subas created in 1580 were each governed by a subedar, with a diwan responsible for revenue collection.
3. Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was a complete success in forging lasting bonds and eliminating all conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administration and daily routine. The jharoka darshan was a crucial part of his public image and allowed direct interaction with his subjects. The twelve subas had the mentioned administrative structure.  Statement 3 is an overstatement. While Akbar's matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers were significant, they did not eliminate all conflict.  The question assesses knowledge of Akbar's administrative structure, his public image, and his relations with Rajput rulers. The correct option demonstrates understanding of the practical aspects of Akbar's rule and avoids oversimplifying the complexities of his relationships with Rajput rulers.


**20. With reference to Babur's invasion of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's initial campaigns in India were primarily motivated by the limited resources and unstable political situation in Kabul.
2. The Battle of Panipat (1526) marked a decisive turning point, leading to the immediate and complete establishment of Mughal rule throughout India.
3. Babur's victory at Khanwa (1527) secured his position in the Delhi-Agra region but did not entirely eliminate the threat from Afghan forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Babur's initial campaigns in India were indeed driven by the precarious situation in Kabul. The Battle of Khanwa did secure his position in the Delhi-Agra region, but the threat from Afghan forces persisted. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Battle of Panipat did not immediately establish Mughal rule throughout India; further battles and campaigns were necessary.  This question assesses knowledge of Babur's motivations and the strategic context of his early campaigns in India. The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the challenges Babur faced and the gradual nature of the Mughal conquest of India.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's daily routine included a public appearance at the jharoka and a midday darbar for addressing public petitions.
2.  Confidential consultations with ministers generally took place in a chamber near Akbar's bathing apartment, eventually called the Ghusal Khana.
3.  Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each with a governor (Subedar) and other key officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative system. The jharoka darshan (public appearance) and the open darbar were integral parts of Akbar's strategy to maintain direct contact with his subjects and address their grievances. The Ghusal Khana, initially a chamber near Akbar's bathing area, evolved into a space for private consultations with ministers, highlighting the importance of both public and private channels of governance. The division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580, with the specified provinces and officials, demonstrates Akbar's focus on establishing a structured, decentralized administrative system with checks and balances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial elements of Akbar's administrative structure and daily routine, which were meticulously planned and executed to ensure efficient governance and accessibility.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal, ruler of Amber, in 1562, was solely motivated by strategic political alliances, neglecting personal or familial considerations.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy involved only matrimonial alliances with powerful Rajput rulers to consolidate his power.
3.  Akbar's policy towards the Rajputs included granting complete religious freedom to his Hindu wives and elevating their families within the Mughal nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 correctly describes a key aspect of Akbar's Rajput policy. While strategic alliances were certainly a factor in his marriages,  the text suggests a more nuanced approach involving personal relationships and respect for the religious beliefs of his Hindu wives.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it oversimplifies the motivations behind Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, overlooking the personal and familial dimensions.  Statement 2 is also incorrect as Akbar's Rajput policy was not limited to matrimonial alliances; he also employed other strategies, such as granting autonomy and high positions to Rajput rulers regardless of marriage.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately captures a significant element of Akbar's successful Rajput policy.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire's relations with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's acquisition of Qandahar in 1595 was primarily to establish a defensible frontier against potential Uzbek invasion, rather than as part of a partition agreement with the Uzbeks over Persian territories.
2.  Shah Abbas I of Persia's cordial relations with the Mughals remained unaffected by the Mughal conquest of Qandahar in 1595.
3.  Jahangir's loss of Qandahar to Shah Abbas I in 1622 stemmed from his diplomatic isolation and military unpreparedness, exacerbated by Prince Shah Jahan's reluctance to participate in the defense.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the dynamics of Mughal foreign policy.  The acquisition of Qandahar was primarily a strategic move to secure the northwestern frontier against Uzbek threats, and not the result of any formal partition agreement.  The loss of Qandahar under Jahangir was indeed due to his unpreparedness and diplomatic isolation, compounded by Prince Shah Jahan's actions. Statement 2 is incorrect because while there was an attempt to maintain cordial relations after the conquest of Qandahar, the event did create tension in the relationship, ultimately leading to the loss of Qandahar under Jahangir. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete and inaccurate.


**4. With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is considered a masterpiece of architecture, representing a culmination of earlier styles and a starting point for new architectural trends.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's new city on the banks of the Yamuna near Delhi, of which only the Purana Qila and its mosque survive, was built primarily to establish a strong military presence.
3. Sher Shah Suri's religious policy was characterized by strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy and a discriminatory approach towards non-Muslims.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Sher Shah Suri's architectural achievements and urban planning. His tomb at Sasaram is widely recognized for its architectural significance. The construction of a new city near Delhi, with the Purana Qila as a key surviving structure, reflects his ambition for urban development.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri was a Muslim ruler, the text explicitly states he was not a bigot and did not initiate new discriminatory policies against non-Muslims, although the Jizya tax remained in place. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are demonstrably true.


**5.  With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and pilgrim tax was primarily motivated by his conversion to a syncretic faith.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a place for Muslim theological discussions, was later opened to people of all faiths, leading to debates on various religious and philosophical issues.
3.  Akbar's Mazhar, a declaration asserting his right to interpret religious matters in case of conflicting views among religious scholars, was widely accepted without any opposition from orthodox religious elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately reflects Akbar's actions regarding the Ibadat Khana.  The Ibadat Khana's evolution from a space for Muslim theological discussions to one inclusive of all faiths is well-documented.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while his religious views evolved, the abolition of taxes was primarily for administrative and social harmony, not solely due to a conversion. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Mazhar, while asserting Akbar's authority, did meet significant opposition from orthodox religious elements who viewed it as a challenge to their authority.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a specific aspect of Akbar's religious policies.


**6. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus constituted a significant portion of the Mughal nobility, with Rajputs forming the largest group, significantly impacting the nobility's overall composition.
2.  The Mughal mansabdari system, refined under Jahangir and Shah Jahan, ensured orderly promotions and recruitment within the nobility, contributing to its stability.
3.  The Mughal nobility's high salaries and lavish lifestyles led to financial instability and widespread debt among its members, hindering economic development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe key features of the Mughal nobility.  The inclusion of Hindus, especially Rajputs, significantly altered the nobility's composition under Akbar. The mansabdari system, while not eliminating all issues, did create a more structured and stable system for managing the nobility under Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Statement 3 is incorrect; while nobles spent lavishly, the text indicates that their involvement in commerce and land ownership contributed to the economy, with only some nobles falling into debt. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete or inaccurate.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda was achieved swiftly and decisively due to the superior military strength of the Mughal army and Aurangzeb's effective military strategies.
2. The execution of Sambhaji, the Maratha king, was a strategic mistake by Aurangzeb, which further fueled Maratha resistance and decentralized their leadership, making them more difficult to subdue.
3. Aurangzeb's prolonged campaigns in the Deccan resulted in the draining of Mughal resources, weakening the empire's overall strength and contributing to its decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately represent Aurangzeb's Deccan policy's consequences.  The execution of Sambhaji was a significant miscalculation, strengthening Maratha resistance.  The protracted Deccan campaigns depleted Mughal resources and manpower, weakening the empire.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the conquests of Bijapur and Golconda were long and arduous, involving sieges and significant resistance, underlining the challenges Aurangzeb faced.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete or inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the early Ghaznavid incursions into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's repeated raids into India were primarily motivated by the desire to acquire wealth and plunder, with little strategic or political objective.
2. The Ghaznavid conquests of the Punjab and Multan significantly altered the political landscape of North India, paving the way for future Turkish incursions into the Gangetic heartland.
3.  The Ghaznavid Empire's decline was primarily caused by internal conflicts and the rise of the Seljuk Empire, reducing their ability to launch major incursions into India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the Ghaznavid impact and decline. The Ghaznavid conquests of the Punjab and Multan significantly changed the political dynamics of North India, weakening existing powers and making further incursions easier.  The Ghaznavid decline was indeed due to internal conflicts and the rise of the Seljuk Empire.  Statement 1 is an oversimplification; while plunder was a significant motive, Mahmud's actions also had political and strategic implications, establishing a foothold in India.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 provide a more complete and accurate picture of the Ghaznavid period.



**9. With reference to the Rajput states in the 11th and 12th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajput states, characterized by a strong clan-based social structure, were united under a single powerful ruler, effectively resisting the Ghaznavid incursions.
2. The architectural achievements of the Rajput period, particularly temple construction in the Nagara style, reached a peak between the 10th and 12th centuries, evident in examples like Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar temples.
3. The continuous warfare among Rajput states, driven by rivalry and ambition, weakened their collective ability to effectively resist external threats like the Ghaznavids.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the Rajput situation in the 11th and 12th centuries.  The Nagara style of temple architecture flourished during this period, with Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar being prime examples. The constant internal warfare among Rajput states hindered their ability to present a united front against external threats. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Rajput states were not united under a single ruler; they were characterized by internal conflicts and rivalries. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the Rajput states during this era.


**10. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's initial incursions into India were primarily driven by the desire to gain control of the lucrative Punjab region to improve the meagre financial resources of his Kabul kingdom.
2. Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat in 1526 was solely due to his superior military tactics and the effective use of gunpowder and artillery, surpassing the numerical superiority of Ibrahim Lodi's army.
3. Babur's victory at the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 against Rana Sanga marked the consolidation of Mughal power in North India, ending all significant resistance to his rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 accurately describes Babur's initial motivations. His desire for the economic benefits of the Punjab is clearly stated in the text. Statement 2 is incorrect because it oversimplifies the Battle of Panipat, overlooking the role of other factors such as flanking maneuvers and the morale of the troops.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the Battle of Khanwa was a significant victory, it did not end all resistance to Babur's rule, and further conflicts followed.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides an accurate and nuanced understanding of Babur's early campaigns in India.

**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Diwan-i-Am*, Akbar's public audience hall, was typically held in the afternoon.
2.  Akbar's private consultations with ministers often took place in a chamber near his bathing apartment, informally known as the *Ghusal Khana*.
3.  The twelve *subas* established in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Aimer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each governed by a team of officials headed by a *Subedar*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Akbar's open darbar (*Diwan-i-Am*) lasted until midday.  The rest of his day was dedicated to other administrative duties and private meetings.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Akbar's use of a chamber near his bathing apartment (*Ghusal Khana*) for confidential consultations with ministers, which eventually became known as the *Ghusal Khana*. This showcases Akbar's pragmatic approach to governance, utilizing existing spaces for efficient administration.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately lists the twelve *subas* established under Akbar in 1580 and describes the administrative structure of each province, highlighting the system of checks and balances implemented.  This demonstrates Akbar's ability to efficiently govern a vast and diverse empire.  The mention of a team of officials headed by a *Subedar* underscores the complexity and sophistication of his administrative machinery.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, solely aimed at consolidating his political power in Rajasthan.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy exclusively relied on matrimonial alliances to secure Rajput loyalty.
3.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor, despite not having matrimonial ties with Akbar, remained in his favor due to their military prowess.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the marriage undoubtedly strengthened Akbar's political position, the text suggests a more nuanced approach.  Akbar's relationship with Bharmal went beyond mere political expediency, showing respect for Rajput traditions and culture.  The fostering of Prince Danyal with Bharmal's wives also signifies the personal element in Akbar's Rajput policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Akbar did not insist upon matrimonial relations as a precondition for Rajput alliances.  The example of the Hadas of Ranthambhor demonstrates this, highlighting the flexibility and pragmatism of Akbar's approach.  This showcases Akbar's ability to adapt his policies based on the specific circumstances of each Rajput state.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly mentions that despite the absence of matrimonial alliances, the Hadas of Ranthambhor maintained a high position in Akbar's favour, indicating that his Rajput policy was not solely based on marriage. This demonstrates the multifaceted nature of Akbar's strategy, emphasizing loyalty, military strength, and political pragmatism.


**3. With reference to the Mughal administrative system in the Deccan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's treaty with Bijapur in 1636 resulted in the complete subjugation of Bijapur to Mughal authority.
2.  The treaty of 1636 between Shah Jahan and Golconda stipulated that Golconda would pay an annual tribute to Bijapur, in addition to the Mughal emperor.
3.  The treaties of 1636 with Bijapur and Golconda facilitated the expansion of these states southward into Karnataka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Shah Jahan's treaty with Bijapur in 1636 established Mughal suzerainty, but Bijapur retained a significant degree of autonomy.  Bijapur agreed to pay an indemnity and not interfere in Golconda's affairs, but it wasn't completely subjugated. This illustrates the complex power dynamics in the Deccan and Shah Jahan's pragmatic approach to diplomacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The treaty with Golconda stipulated that Golconda would *stop* paying tribute to Bijapur and instead pay a smaller tribute to the Mughal emperor.  This demonstrates Shah Jahan's ability to restructure the existing power balance in the Deccan to his advantage.

Statement 3 is correct. The treaties of 1636 created a period of peace, enabling Bijapur and Golconda to expand their territories southward into Karnataka.  This highlights the unintended consequences of Mughal policy and the complex interplay between diplomacy, war, and territorial expansion in the Deccan.  The subsequent internal conflicts within these expanded Deccan states are also a critical point for understanding the region's history.


**4. With reference to the composition of the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus constituted approximately 84% of the Mughal nobility.
2.  The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility significantly increased during Aurangzeb's reign, exceeding that of the Rajputs.
3.  Jahangir was the first Mughal emperor to recognize the Marathas' significance in the Deccan and attempted to integrate them into the Mughal nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that under Akbar in 1594, Hindus constituted only about 16% of the nobility. This highlights the initial limited integration of Hindus into the primarily Muslim Mughal elite.  The later increase in Hindu representation is a significant aspect of Mughal policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility did increase under Aurangzeb, it's misleading to say it exceeded that of the Rajputs.  While Marathas formed a significant portion of the Hindu nobles during Aurangzeb's reign, the text does not support the claim of exceeding the Rajputs in number.  This requires careful analysis of the numerical data provided.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text specifically mentions that Jahangir was the first Mughal emperor who recognized the Marathas' importance in the Deccan and attempted to win them over. This reflects the evolving Mughal strategy in dealing with powerful regional forces.  The inclusion of Maratha sardars, like Shahji, the father of Shivaji, in the Mughal service is a critical aspect of this policy.


**5.  With reference to the Mughal army, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Ahadis* were low-ranking foot soldiers in the Mughal army.
2.  The Mughal artillery under Aurangzeb was largely dependent on foreign expertise.
3.  The Mughal cavalry was the principal arm of the Mughal army, primarily supplied by the *mansabdars*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The *Ahadis* were actually gentlemen-troopers, a highly trusted corps directly recruited by the emperors and receiving high salaries. This shows the diversity within the Mughal military structure and the importance of elite units.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While initially, the Mughals employed Ottoman and Portuguese expertise in artillery, by Aurangzeb's reign, Mughal artillery had significantly improved, and foreign employment in this department decreased. This illustrates the Mughal's capacity for technological advancement and their gradual indigenization of military technology.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the cavalry was the principal arm of the Mughal army, overwhelmingly provided by the *mansabdars*. This highlights the central role of the *mansabdari* system in organizing and maintaining the Mughal military. The dependence on the *mansabdars* for cavalry also reveals the inherent link between the feudal land system and the military strength of the empire.


**6. With reference to Alauddin Khalji's agrarian and market policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures were primarily aimed at curbing the power of Hindu traders.
2. The land revenue in the Doab region under Alauddin Khalji was assessed based on the actual measurement of cultivated land.
3. Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms led to widespread peasant rebellions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Barani suggests this motivation, the policies impacted both Hindu and Muslim traders. Alauddin's focus was on price stability and ensuring sufficient resources for his army, not specifically targeting any religious group. This shows the complexity of Alauddin's motives and the limitations of interpreting historical sources.

Statement 2 is correct. Alauddin Khalji implemented a system of land measurement in the Doab to ensure fair and equitable taxation. This highlights Alauddin's attempts at reforming the land revenue system and preventing the exploitation of peasants by powerful landlords. The shift towards direct state collection of land revenue is a significant aspect of his reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not mention widespread peasant rebellions as a direct result of Alauddin's policies. While his reforms were harsh, they were not so burdensome as to incite large-scale uprisings. This demonstrates the need for nuanced understanding of the impact of economic policies on different social groups.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's initial Deccan policy focused on a rapid, all-out conquest of Bijapur and Golconda.
2. The execution of Sambhaji, the Maratha king, was a strategic blunder that intensified Maratha resistance.
3.  The conquest of Bijapur and Golconda effectively ended the Maratha threat to the Mughal Empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's initial Deccan policy was more cautious, involving a combination of diplomacy and military action.  He initially avoided a direct confrontation, aiming to weaken the Deccan sultanates through a combination of alliances and smaller-scale military engagements. This illustrates Aurangzeb's calculated and pragmatic approach to warfare.

Statement 2 is correct.  The execution of Sambhaji is widely considered a strategic mistake that fueled Maratha resistance and made a unified Maratha opposition more difficult to manage.  This was a critical turning point in the Mughal-Maratha conflict.  This act eliminated a potential negotiating partner and provided the Marathas with a powerful rallying point.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The conquest of Bijapur and Golconda did not end the Maratha threat. Instead, it led to a more widespread and resilient form of resistance under new leaders. This demonstrates the limitations of military conquest and the complexities of dealing with a decentralized guerrilla movement. The subsequent Maratha expansion highlights the failure of Aurangzeb's strategy.


**8. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's initial incursions into India were primarily motivated by his desire to acquire the wealth of the Punjab.
2. Daulat Khan Lodi consistently supported Babur in his campaigns against Ibrahim Lodi.
3. Babur's victory at Panipat was primarily due to his superior cavalry tactics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Babur's campaigns were driven by the need to secure resources and a more stable base of power. The meagre resources of Kabul and the threat from the Uzbeks made the acquisition of the wealth of the Punjab a strategic imperative. This illustrates the economic and strategic considerations underlying Babur's invasion of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Daulat Khan Lodi’s allegiance shifted several times, initially opposing Babur and then supporting him for opportunistic reasons.  This demonstrates the complex political landscape of the time and the shifting alliances among the various power players.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Babur's cavalry played a role, his victory at Panipat was significantly influenced by his use of artillery and innovative battlefield tactics like the cart-based fortifications.  This highlights the importance of military technology and strategic thinking in shaping the outcome of the battle.  The use of artillery was a critical element in Babur's victory.


**1. With reference to the Deccan region during the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's treaty with Bijapur involved Bijapur's recognition of Mughal suzerainty and payment of an indemnity.
2.  The treaty with Golconda stipulated the inclusion of Shah Jahan's name in the khutba and the cessation of Golconda's tribute to Bijapur.
3.  Following the 1636 treaties, Bijapur and Golconda experienced a period of internal cohesion, consolidating their hold over conquered territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Shah Jahan's policy in the Deccan focused on Bijapur, offering a combination of military pressure and diplomatic negotiation. The treaty resulted in Bijapur acknowledging Mughal supremacy and paying a substantial indemnity. This reflects Shah Jahan's strategic approach to consolidating Mughal influence in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The treaty with Golconda similarly aimed at bringing this Deccan Sultanate under Mughal influence. The Qutb Shah agreed to include Shah Jahan's name in the khutba (Friday sermon), a clear symbol of allegiance, and ceased paying tribute to Bijapur, instead paying a reduced tribute to the Mughal emperor.  This demonstrates Shah Jahan's success in restructuring the power dynamics in the Deccan.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the treaties of 1636 initially led to expansion for Bijapur and Golconda, this rapid expansion ultimately weakened their internal cohesion.  Ambitious nobles like Shahji and Mir Jumla started carving out their own spheres of influence, undermining the stability of both states. This internal strife contradicts the assertion of consolidated power and lasting peace.  The text explicitly states that rapid expansion weakened internal cohesion, setting the stage for future conflicts.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the outcomes of Shah Jahan's Deccan policy.


**2. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah II of Bijapur is known for his patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi literature and his invitation of Catholic missionaries.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II's musical compositions, documented in the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, integrated elements of Hindu devotional music.
3.  The Golconda Sultanate is renowned for its patronage of Urdu literature, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah being a notable poet who introduced secular themes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Ali Adil Shah I (note the correction of the ruler's number) as a figure who fostered religious tolerance and cultural exchange. His patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi, along with his invitation of Catholic missionaries, showcases his open-mindedness and interest in diverse cultural influences.  This stands in contrast to some other Deccan rulers of the time who were less tolerant.

Statement 2 accurately describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II's passion for music and his contribution to the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*. The integration of Hindu devotional elements into his musical compositions reflects the religious syncretism prevalent in the Deccan. This demonstrates the cultural blending and artistic innovation of the period.

Statement 3 is also accurate.  Golconda under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was a center of literary activity, particularly the development of Dakhini Urdu.  The Sultan's own poetic works, which incorporated secular themes alongside religious ones, played a significant role in the evolution of Urdu literature. This highlights the flourishing of a unique literary tradition in the Deccan that drew upon various linguistic and cultural influences.  Therefore, all three statements accurately depict the cultural contributions of the Deccan states.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire's administrative and political developments in the first half of the 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jahangir and Shah Jahan followed Akbar's administrative system, maintaining alliances with Rajputs and expanding their political base through alliances with Afghans and Marathas.
2.  The Mughal emperors of this period focused primarily on internal consolidation, neglecting external relations with neighboring Asian powers.
3.  Despite the growing prosperity of the ruling classes, the lives of peasants and workers remained largely unchanged and characterized by hardship.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jahangir and Shah Jahan, while adding their own styles, largely continued the administrative structures established by Akbar.  They maintained diplomatic and, in some cases, marital alliances with Rajput rulers, a key element of Akbar's policy of integrating powerful regional elites into the Mughal system.  They also sought to broaden their political base by forging alliances with other groups, including Afghans and Marathas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Mughal emperors during this period did not neglect external relations. The text highlights the Mughals' efforts to maintain stable relations with neighboring powers like Iran, the Uzbeks, and the Ottoman Turks. This was crucial for trade and to prevent external threats to the empire's stability.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly notes the disparity between the growing wealth and prosperity of the ruling classes and the persistent hardship faced by the majority of the population – peasants and workers. This highlights the social and economic inequalities inherent in the Mughal system. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**4. With reference to Akbar's land revenue system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *zabt* system, implemented in areas from Lahore to Allahabad, involved measuring the land and assessing revenue based on average produce and prices over a five-year period.
2.  The *batai* system involved a fixed proportion of the produce being shared between the peasant and the state, requiring a large number of officials to be present during harvest.
3.  The *rasag* system, also known as *kankut*, was a new system of assessment based solely on the inspection of crops and estimation of the village's total payable amount.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the *zabt* system did involve land measurement and assessment based on average produce and prices, the period was ten years, not five.  The core of the *zabt* system was accurate measurement and a fair assessment based on historical data, aiming for greater equity and predictability in revenue collection.

Statement 2 is correct. The *batai* system, a sharecropping arrangement, involved a pre-determined division of the harvest between the peasant and the state.  This system indeed required a significant presence of officials during harvest to ensure fair division, although not necessarily "a large number" as stated.  The accuracy of the division was crucial for the system's success.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The *rasag* system, also called *kankut*, was not a new system, and it wasn't based solely on crop inspection. It was an older, rough estimation method primarily based on past payments, though it could incorporate some elements of crop inspection. It was a less precise method compared to the *zabt* system.  Thus, only statement 2 accurately describes a feature of Akbar's land revenue systems.


**5. With reference to Akbar's religious policies and the Ibadat Khana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar initially exhibited orthodox Muslim beliefs but later became influenced by mysticism and liberal ideas, leading to the establishment of the Ibadat Khana.
2.  The Ibadat Khana initially involved discussions only among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives of various religions, sparking controversies among orthodox elements.
3.  The dismissal of Abdun Nabi, the Chief Sadr, due to corruption and bigotry, strengthened Akbar's position in implementing his religious policies and further distanced him from orthodox religious figures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's evolving religious views.  He started with orthodox Muslim beliefs but gradually embraced a more syncretic and tolerant approach, influenced by Sufism and his interactions with diverse religious scholars. The establishment of the Ibadat Khana was a direct outcome of this shift.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ibadat Khana initially focused on discussions among Muslim theologians, but Akbar later opened it to representatives of other faiths. This inclusive approach, while intended to foster religious understanding, generated considerable opposition from orthodox Muslims who saw it as a threat to their religious beliefs and practices.

Statement 3 is likewise accurate. The removal of Abdun Nabi due to corruption and religious intolerance strengthened Akbar's position to pursue his liberal religious policies.  Abdun Nabi's actions represented the very kind of religious bigotry Akbar sought to counteract, and his dismissal served as a powerful symbol of Akbar's commitment to religious tolerance and efficient governance. Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's religious policies and the role of the Ibadat Khana.


**6. With reference to Akbar's consolidation of the Northwest Frontier and relations with Central Asian powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's campaigns in Kashmir and Baluchistan aimed to secure the Northwest Frontier and prevent Uzbek incursions into Mughal territory.  
2.  Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 facilitated trade along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab, and the death of Abdullah Uzbek removed a significant threat from the north.
3.  Akbar's relations with Iran remained strained due to disputes over Qandahar, despite efforts to maintain cordial ties and a shared concern about the Uzbek threat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's campaigns in Kashmir and Baluchistan were strategically crucial for securing the northwestern frontier of his empire.  These actions aimed to establish a strong defensive perimeter against potential incursions from Central Asian powers, particularly the Uzbeks, who posed a consistent threat to the Mughal territories. The marriage alliance further cemented these gains.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The conquest of Sindh provided access to the Indus River, significantly boosting trade and commerce between Punjab and other regions.  The death of Abdullah Uzbek, a powerful Central Asian ruler, indeed removed a major threat to the Mughal empire's northwestern stability. This allowed Akbar to focus his attention on other areas of his empire.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While disputes over Qandahar did exist, Akbar's relations with Iran were not consistently strained.  The text indicates that despite the territorial conflict, Akbar and Shah Abbas I sought to maintain cordial ties, recognizing the mutual threat from the Uzbeks. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**7. With reference to Babur's conquest of the Punjab and the First Battle of Panipat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's initial conquests in the Punjab were facilitated by the weakened state of the Lodi Sultanate and the ambition of Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of the Punjab.
2.  The First Battle of Panipat saw Babur's superior artillery and tactical formations, including the use of the "Ottoman device," decisively defeat Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior army.
3.  Babur's victory at Panipat immediately led to the consolidation of his rule over all of North India, securing his long-term control of the region without further conflict.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Babur's successful inroads into the Punjab were significantly aided by the internal weaknesses of the Lodi Sultanate.  The ambitions and shifting loyalties of Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab, created opportunities for Babur to exploit the existing divisions and gain a foothold in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Babur's victory at Panipat was achieved through a combination of factors, including superior artillery and innovative tactical formations.  The "Ottoman device" – a defensive arrangement of carts and breastworks – played a crucial role in protecting his army and countering Ibrahim Lodi's larger force. The effective use of gunpowder weaponry also proved decisive.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Babur's victory at Panipat, while a significant turning point, did not immediately result in the complete and unchallenged consolidation of his rule over all of North India.  He faced further resistance and fought subsequent battles, notably against Rana Sanga at Khanwa, before securing more substantial control over the region.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.



**8. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's emphasis on improving trade and commerce included the restoration of the Grand Trunk Road, the construction of numerous sarais, and the standardization of weights and measures.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system involved the accurate measurement of land, the establishment of a fixed crop rate, and the option for peasants to pay in either cash or kind.
3.  Sher Shah Suri's military reforms included the continuation of tribal levies under tribal chiefs and the introduction of a new system of military pay based on land grants instead of cash.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Sher Shah Suri's focus on economic development is evident in his infrastructure projects and economic policies. The restoration and improvement of the Grand Trunk Road, the construction of numerous sarais (roadside inns) to facilitate trade and travel, and the standardization of weights and measures all aimed to boost economic activity and enhance the empire's connectivity.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system represented a significant improvement over earlier systems.  It emphasized accurate land measurement to ensure fair assessment, established a fixed crop rate for determining the state's share, and offered peasants the flexibility to pay in either cash or kind, promoting efficiency and fairness in revenue collection.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sher Shah Suri's military reforms did *not* involve the continuation of tribal levies.  He moved away from relying on tribal chiefs and their levies, instead opting for a more centralized and standardized military structure.  Further, the assertion that his military pay was based on land grants is incorrect; he emphasized a system of regular cash payments to soldiers, improving their loyalty and efficiency. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms.


**1. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a significant example of the transition between architectural styles.
2. The Purana Qila in Delhi is a surviving structure from a new city built by Sher Shah Suri.
3. Sher Shah Suri's reign saw the completion of the Padmavat, a notable work in Hindi literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Sher Shah Suri's reign. His tomb at Sasaram is indeed a remarkable architectural achievement, representing a blend of pre-existing styles and foreshadowing later developments.  The Purana Qila (Old Fort) in Delhi is a testament to his urban planning, a surviving remnant of a larger city he constructed near the Yamuna River.  Finally, the completion of Malik Muhammad Jaisi's Padmavat during his reign highlights his patronage of literature and the flourishing of Hindi literary works.  There's no ambiguity or misleading information in these statements; they are all well-established historical facts.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one of these demonstrably true facts about Sher Shah Suri's rule.  The question tests factual recall of significant details about Sher Shah Suri's contributions to architecture, urban development, and cultural patronage.


**2. With reference to the early life of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's birth occurred during Humayun's retreat from Bikaner, while seeking refuge in Amarkot.
2.  Akbar's uncle, Kamran, held him captive for a significant period after Humayun fled to Persia.
3. Akbar's coronation took place at Agra following the decisive Battle of Panipat against Hemu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate depictions of Akbar's early life.  Akbar was indeed born in Amarkot in 1542 while Humayun was in retreat, having received shelter from the Rana of Amarkot.  Following Humayun's flight to Persia (Iran), young Akbar was indeed captured by his uncle, Kamran.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Akbar's coronation actually took place at Kalanaur in the Punjab, not Agra, and it preceded the Battle of Panipat. The Battle of Panipat was crucial in securing Akbar's claim to the throne, but the coronation happened before the battle. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correct statement while including an incorrect one. The question assesses the examinee's knowledge of chronologically significant events in Akbar's early life, testing their capacity for factual recall and chronological understanding.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Panipat (1556), consider the following statements:**

1. Hemu, the Afghan commander, had an undefeated record of twenty-two battles before Panipat.
2. Hemu's army comprised a significantly larger number of cavalry and elephants than the Mughal forces.
3. The Mughal victory was primarily due to Bairam Khan's strategic maneuvers and Hemu's accidental injury.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the Battle of Panipat in 1556. Hemu, before his encounter with Akbar's forces, had indeed won twenty-two consecutive battles, establishing his reputation as a formidable military commander. His army significantly outnumbered the Mughals in terms of cavalry and elephants, presenting a formidable challenge.  The Mughal victory was a result of a combination of factors, including Bairam Khan's astute leadership and strategic decisions, as well as the fortuitous event of an arrow striking Hemu in the eye, leading to his incapacitation and the subsequent collapse of the Afghan army.  The other options are incomplete, failing to capture the totality of the factors contributing to this pivotal battle.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details of the battle and understand the interplay of factors that led to the Mughal victory.


**4. With reference to Akbar's early reign and his relationship with Bairam Khan, consider the following statements:**

1. Bairam Khan, Akbar's tutor and regent, was accused of favoring Shia Muslims in appointments to high offices.
2. Akbar's dismissal of Bairam Khan was a calculated move to consolidate his own power, though Bairam Khan initially intended to submit.
3. Bairam Khan's assassination occurred in Mecca after he chose to retire there following his rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately portray the complex dynamics between Akbar and Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan, while known for his relatively liberal religious views, faced accusations of favoring Shia Muslims in his appointments.  Akbar's decision to dismiss Bairam Khan was indeed a strategic move aimed at asserting his authority as the emperor.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Bairam Khan was assassinated on his way to Mecca, at Patan near Ahmedabad, not in Mecca itself. The assassination was carried out by an Afghan who held a personal grudge against him.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus inaccurate due to the inclusion of the false statement about Bairam Khan's death location. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the political maneuvering and power dynamics during Akbar's early reign, particularly the relationship between the young emperor and his powerful regent.


**5. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system, but later switched to an annual assessment due to the complexities of a fixed central price schedule.
2.  The 'dagh' system, involving branding horses, and strict accounting of jagirdar incomes, contributed to significant rebellions during Akbar's reign.
3. The abolition of the jizya tax by Akbar was primarily a measure to improve revenue collection efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative reforms.  Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system, but later shifted to an annual assessment due to the difficulties of maintaining a fixed central price schedule that was fair and efficient across the diverse regions of his empire.  The strict enforcement of the 'dagh' system, a system of branding horses to prevent fraud, and the rigorous accounting of jagirdar incomes did indeed lead to significant rebellions, as many nobles resented this tightening of control over their resources. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The abolition of the jizya tax was not primarily an economic measure but a significant step towards religious tolerance and the fostering of a more unified empire.  The other options are therefore incomplete or inaccurate, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of Akbar's administrative policies and their impact.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Akbar's administrative reforms and their consequences, requiring both factual recall and analytical understanding.


**6.  With reference to Akbar's relations with the Rajputs, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, was primarily a strategic alliance to secure Rajput support.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati was a decisive victory for the Mughals, leading to the immediate submission of Rana Pratap.
3. Akbar's Rajput policy involved not only matrimonial alliances but also the appointment of Rajputs to high administrative and military positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate representations of Akbar's Rajput policy. The marriage to Harkha Bai was a significant strategic move, strengthening the alliance with the powerful Amber state.  Akbar's policy also involved appointing Rajputs to high positions, integrating them into the Mughal administration and military. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Battle of Haldighati, while a significant engagement, was not a decisive Mughal victory that led to Rana Pratap's immediate submission. Rana Pratap continued his resistance through guerrilla warfare for many years after the battle. The other options, therefore, incorrectly include the false statement about the Battle of Haldighati's outcome. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the complexities of Akbar's Rajput policy, its strategic dimensions, and its long-term impact on the Mughal empire.


**7.  With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana, initially a place of Muslim theological discussions, was later opened to people of all faiths.
2. Akbar's Mazhar, often misinterpreted as a "Decree of Infallibility," asserted his right to choose among differing interpretations of the Quran.
3.  The dismissal of Abdun Nabi, the Chief Sadr, was primarily due to his incompetence in managing charitable lands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Akbar's religious policies.  The Ibadat Khana, initially intended for discussions among Muslim theologians, was subsequently opened to representatives of various faiths, reflecting Akbar's pursuit of religious understanding and tolerance.  Akbar's Mazhar did indeed assert his right to choose among differing interpretations of the Quran, particularly in cases of conflict, but this was not a claim of infallibility, as is often wrongly interpreted.  However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Abdun Nabi's dismissal was partly due to his mismanagement of charitable lands, it was also significantly influenced by his bigotry and tyrannical actions against Shias and Hindus.  The other options, therefore, either include the inaccurate statement 3 or omit one or both of the correct statements. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of Akbar's religious policies, their evolution, and their historical context, requiring both factual recall and analytical interpretation.


**8. With reference to the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier during Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquest of Qandhar in 1595 was primarily a defensive measure against the threat posed by the Uzbeks.
2. The death of Mirza Hakim, Akbar's half-brother, led to the annexation of Kabul into the Mughal Empire.
3.  The agreement between Akbar and Abdullah Khan Uzbek established the Amu Darya River as the definitive boundary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe events on the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier during Akbar's reign.  Akbar's conquest of Qandhar was indeed a primarily defensive measure, aimed at securing the empire's northwestern flank against the potential threat of Uzbek expansion. The death of Mirza Hakim did lead to the annexation of Kabul into the Mughal Empire. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement between Akbar and Abdullah Khan Uzbek did not establish the Amu Darya River as the boundary; it was the Hindu Kush mountain range. The other options are therefore incomplete or inaccurate. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the geopolitical context of Akbar's reign, particularly the challenges posed by the Uzbeks and the strategic decisions Akbar made to secure the empire's frontiers.


**9. With reference to Jahangir's reign and his relationship with Nur Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1. Nur Jahan's influence on Jahangir's court led to a significant increase in the prestige of Persian art and culture.
2. The rebellion of Khusrau, Jahangir's eldest son, occurred shortly after Jahangir's succession to the throne.
3. Nur Jahan's family, including her father Itimaduddaula and brother Asaf Khan, held significant positions in Jahangir's administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect events and relationships during Jahangir's reign. Nur Jahan's influence indeed led to a rise in the prestige of Persian art and culture at the Mughal court.  Khusrau's rebellion did take place shortly after Jahangir's ascension to the throne.  Nur Jahan's family members, particularly her father and brother, held powerful positions within Jahangir's administration. Therefore, all statements are historically accurate and provide a nuanced understanding of the political and cultural landscape of Jahangir's court.  The other options fail to capture the complete picture of these interconnected events.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the political and cultural dynamics of Jahangir's reign and the significant role played by Nur Jahan.


**10. With reference to Shah Jahan's reign and the Deccan, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's treaties with Bijapur and Golconda in 1636 established Mughal suzerainty over the Deccan.
2. The conquest of Ahmadnagar was a major factor in the treaties concluded between Shah Jahan and the Deccan Sultanates.
3.  Shahji Bhonsle's activities in Bijapur were a significant concern for Shah Jahan, leading to diplomatic efforts to manage his influence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect Shah Jahan's Deccan policy. His treaties with Bijapur and Golconda did establish Mughal suzerainty over the Deccan, bringing a period of relative peace and stability to the region. The conquest of Ahmadnagar was a significant event that reshaped the power dynamics in the Deccan and influenced the terms of the treaties.  Shahji Bhonsle's activities within Bijapur were indeed a concern for Shah Jahan, prompting diplomatic efforts to manage his influence and prevent potential conflict.  The other options fail to encompass the full complexity of Shah Jahan's policy in the Deccan.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the political situation in the Deccan during Shah Jahan's reign, requiring knowledge of specific events and their interrelationships.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question aims for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of Mughal and Deccan history.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's division of the empire into twelve Subas in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each governed by a Subedar, Diwan, Bakhshi, Sadr, Qazi, and Waqia-navis.
2.  The Ghusal Khana, initially Akbar's bathing apartment, evolved into a chamber for confidential consultations with ministers.
3. The Jharoka Darshan, Akbar's daily public appearance, was primarily intended to showcase imperial power and grandeur, rather than facilitate direct interaction with the populace.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Akbar's administrative reforms included the crucial division of his empire into twelve Subas, each with a defined administrative structure to ensure efficient governance and a system of checks and balances.  The listed Subas and officials are correctly mentioned.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ghusal Khana's evolution from a bathing chamber to a private consultation room highlights the informal yet effective ways Akbar managed his court and interacted with his ministers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Jharoka Darshan certainly projected imperial power, its primary function was to provide accessibility to the emperor for the common people to present petitions and grievances.  This direct interaction was a key element of Akbar's image and governance. The statement misrepresents the purpose of this practice.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber, was solely a strategic political move, lacking any personal affection or respect for the Rajput ruler.
2.  The policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was unprecedented in the history of India, representing a novel approach to consolidating Mughal power.
3.  Akbar's religious tolerance, exemplified by the abolition of the Jizya tax, was instrumental in securing the loyalty and cooperation of Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the marriage had political dimensions, the text suggests Akbar held Bhara Mal in high regard, evidenced by the subsequent elevation of Bhara Mal and his family.  The statement ignores the personal element in the relationship.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that marriages between Muslim rulers and Hindu daughters were not unusual before Akbar; he expanded and refined the pre-existing practice.  The statement wrongly claims this was a unique approach.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar's religious tolerance and the abolition of the Jizya tax were significant factors in his successful Rajput policy.  This fostered a sense of inclusivity and reduced religious tensions, contributing to the integration of Rajput elites into the Mughal administrative structure.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Haldighati, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Haldighati was primarily a conflict between Hindus and Muslims, reflecting a broader religious divide in 16th-century India.
2.  Rana Pratap's forces at Haldighati comprised solely Rajput warriors; there were no Afghan or Bhil contingents.
3.  Rana Pratap's escape from the Battle of Haldighati marked the end of his armed resistance against the Mughals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes this, stating that the battle was not a religious conflict but involved diverse groups fighting on both sides.  The statement oversimplifies the complex political dynamics of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rana Pratap's army included significant Afghan and Bhil contingents, highlighting the diverse composition of his forces and the broader alliances forged against the Mughals.  The statement omits key components of Rana Pratap's army.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Rana Pratap escaped the battle, the text clearly states that he continued his resistance through guerrilla warfare, not ending his fight at Haldighati. The statement misinterprets the outcome of the battle and its effect on Rana Pratap’s strategy.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jai Singh's 1665 Bijapur campaign was successful in securing significant territorial gains and wealth for the Mughal empire.
2.  Aurangzeb's initial Deccan strategy focused on isolating Bijapur and Golconda from the Marathas through diplomacy and limited military interventions.
3.  The conquest of Bijapur and Golconda was a decisive victory for Aurangzeb, effectively ending the Maratha threat to the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jai Singh's Bijapur campaign failed to achieve its objectives, resulting in neither territorial gains nor significant wealth for the Mughals. The statement contradicts the factual outcome of the campaign.

Statement 2 is correct. Aurangzeb's early Deccan policy prioritized isolating the Deccani sultanates from the Marathas through a combination of diplomatic maneuvers and limited military actions.  The statement accurately reflects Aurangzeb’s initial strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb conquered Bijapur and Golconda, this did not end the Maratha threat; instead, it intensified the conflict, leading to a prolonged and devastating war.  The statement misrepresents the long-term consequences of Aurangzeb’s victories.


**5. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur is known for his patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi literature and his deep interest in music, as evidenced by his composition of the *Kitib-i-Nawras*.
2.  The Charminar, constructed by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, is a significant example of Indo-Islamic architecture.
3.  The Gol Gumbaz, built in Bijapur in 1660, is renowned for its harmonious proportions and the unique acoustic phenomenon within its main chamber.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of both Sanskrit and Marathi literature, along with his passion for music and the creation of the *Kitib-i-Nawras*, showcase the cultural synthesis and tolerance that characterized his reign.

Statement 2 is accurate. The Charminar, a prominent architectural landmark of Hyderabad, stands as a testament to the architectural achievements of the Golconda Sultanate and represents a blend of architectural styles.

Statement 3 is accurate. The Gol Gumbaz is celebrated not only for its architectural grandeur, with its massive dome and minarets, but also for its exceptional acoustics, where a whisper can be heard across the vast interior chamber.  The statement accurately describes the architectural and acoustic features of the Gol Gumbaz.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the Mughal Jagirdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The annexation of Bijapur and Golconda led to a shortage of easily manageable jagirs, forcing Aurangzeb to retain the best ones for direct management (Khalisa).
2.  Shah Jahan reduced the number of horses and sawars a mansabdar was expected to maintain to address the jagir shortage, leading to a salary equivalent to six or five months' pay annually.
3.  The conquest of the Deccan solved the jagir shortage problem by providing ample new land grants for mansabdars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Aurangzeb's annexation of Bijapur and Golconda resulted in a shortage of easily manageable jagirs.  He addressed this by keeping the best jagirs under direct royal control (Khalisa) to fund the war. This created a scarcity of suitable jagirs for distribution among his mansabdars.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly mentions Shah Jahan's attempt to mitigate the jagir shortage by reducing the military obligations (horses and sawars) of mansabdars. This resulted in a salary structure equivalent to six or five months' pay per year, a clear indication of financial adjustments to cope with the limited number of jagirs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The conquest of the Deccan, far from resolving the jagir shortage, exacerbated it.  The newly acquired territories were initially unstable and yielded little income.  Furthermore, Aurangzeb prioritized accommodating Deccani officials and Marathas, leaving fewer jagirs available for existing mansabdars. The text highlights the persistent issue of jagir shortage despite the Deccan conquests.



**2. With reference to Aurangzeb's policies and their impact on the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's execution of Sambhaji, the Maratha leader, strengthened the Maratha resistance by removing a potential figure for negotiation and creating a unifying cause for the Maratha sardars.
2. Aurangzeb's decision to conquer and annex the Deccan states (Bijapur and Golconda) ultimately weakened the Mughal Empire by overextending its administrative reach and opening its communication lines to Maratha attacks.
3. Aurangzeb's consistent policy of mistrust towards Maratha sardars, despite granting them high mansabs, prevented their integration into the Mughal political system, contributing to the empire's decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Aurangzeb's reign and their consequences.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the negative impact of Sambhaji's execution on the Mughal-Maratha conflict. Removing a potential negotiating partner and creating a sense of unified opposition among the Marathas were significant political miscalculations by Aurangzeb.

Statement 2 is supported by the text, which highlights the overextension of the Mughal administration in the Deccan after the conquests of Bijapur and Golconda. This overextension made it difficult to collect taxes and maintain control, weakening the empire's overall stability and leaving it vulnerable to Maratha attacks.

Statement 3 correctly points out Aurangzeb's failure to integrate the Marathas into the Mughal system despite granting them high-ranking mansabs. The lack of trust and the denial of key positions of responsibility fostered resentment and continued Maratha opposition, which ultimately harmed the empire.


**3.  With reference to the composition and role of the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility under Akbar initially consisted predominantly of Central Asian immigrants, with a gradual increase in the proportion of Indian-born nobles over time.
2.  The Mughal nobility was a heterogeneous group comprising various ethnic and religious backgrounds, including Rajputs, Afghans, and Indian Muslims, who often held high mansabs and positions of power.
3.  The decline of the Mughal nobility was primarily due to a cessation of immigration from Central Asia after Aurangzeb's death, leading to a decline in the quality of the administrative class.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mughal nobility initially included many Central Asians, the text clarifies that by Aurangzeb's reign, the majority were Indian-born. The initial composition gradually shifted to include more local recruits.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal nobility was remarkably diverse, encompassing Rajputs, Afghans, and Indian Muslims, all of whom held significant positions within the imperial structure.  This diversity is a key characteristic of the Mughal system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text directly refutes this claim, arguing against the simplistic explanation that the decline of the Mughal nobility was solely due to the end of Central Asian immigration. It emphasizes that the nobility's decline stemmed from internal factors like the jagirdari crisis and administrative decay.  The argument that a colder climate was superior is dismissed as a racialist claim by British historians.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the jizya tax was primarily motivated by economic considerations, aiming to bolster the imperial treasury during a period of financial strain.
2. Aurangzeb's policy towards temples involved a strict adherence to the sharia, allowing the repair of existing temples but prohibiting the construction of new ones.
3. Aurangzeb's actions regarding temples were consistently motivated by religious zeal, leading to widespread destruction of temples throughout his reign, regardless of their age or historical significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the jizya tax did generate revenue, the text indicates that Aurangzeb's motives were more complex, encompassing political and ideological factors.  It was intended to consolidate Muslim support and assert the Islamic character of the state, not solely to address financial issues.

Statement 2 is correct. Aurangzeb's policy regarding temples largely followed the existing sharia guidelines. The text highlights that he allowed repairs of existing structures but forbade the construction of new ones. This policy, while discriminatory, was not a radical departure from established practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Although Aurangzeb did order the destruction of some temples, the text points out that this was not a consistent or widespread policy throughout his reign. The destructions were often linked to political opposition or perceived subversion, rather than being solely driven by religious fanaticism.  The intensity of temple destruction varied across different periods of his reign.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding precise factual recall.

**1. With reference to the Mughal Empire's decline, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of Mughal artillery after Aurangzeb's death significantly hampered their ability to counter Maratha forces in the Deccan, but not in northern India.
2. Aurangzeb's miscalculation in dividing the Marwar state alienated both claimants and Mewar, damaging the Mughal's moral standing but not significantly impacting their military capabilities after 1681.
3. The economic and social factors, along with the neglect of modern science and technology by the Mughal ruling class, were primarily responsible for the empire's decline, while Aurangzeb's religious policies played a secondary role.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that while Mughal artillery's decline affected their ability to counter Marathas in the Deccan, their dominance remained in the northern plains.  This highlights the geographical disparity in the impact of military decline.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs nuance. The alienation of Marwar and Mewar did damage the Mughal's moral standing, as stated. However, the passage suggests that the military impact of this breach after 1681 was minimal, not insignificant. Therefore, this statement is a misleading simplification.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage concludes that the empire's decline was primarily due to economic, social, political, and institutional factors, including the neglect of science and technology. Aurangzeb's religious policies are presented as a contributing factor, not the primary cause. This emphasizes a multi-causal analysis, a crucial aspect of UPSC-style history questions.


**2. With reference to Aurangzeb's religious policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's strict adherence to Islamic law led to the destruction of numerous temples, thereby solidifying Muslim support and enhancing loyalty towards the empire.
2. The re-imposition of jizya, while intended to reinforce Islamic principles, alienated segments of the Hindu population, strengthening opposition to the Mughal empire.
3.  The abolition of jizya and easing of restrictions on temple building shortly after Aurangzeb's death significantly stemmed the rapid decline and disintegration of the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb was orthodox and enforced Islamic law, the passage states that his actions, including temple destruction, *did not* rally Muslim support or increase loyalty.  This contradicts the statement's assertion.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly indicates that Aurangzeb's policies, such as the re-imposition of jizya, alienated Hindus and strengthened opposition to the empire. This demonstrates an understanding of the unintended consequences of Aurangzeb's actions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the post-Aurangzeb changes to jizya and temple building policies had *no effect* on the empire's decline. This highlights that the decline's momentum was already too strong to be reversed by these measures.


**3. With reference to the Mughal nobility under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar in 1594 was significantly higher than 16%, reaching almost 30%, showcasing Akbar's inclusive policies.
2.  Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal were close companions of Akbar, while Raja Todar Mal held significant influence in revenue administration, yet these figures alone do not adequately reflect the overall influence of Hindus within the nobility.
3. Akbar's incorporation of Rajputs into the nobility, primarily Kachhwahas initially, strengthened the aristocratic character of the nobility but also provided avenues for advancement to individuals from lower social strata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the proportion of Hindus in Akbar's nobility in 1594 was approximately 16%, not significantly higher. This is a direct contradiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the close relationships between Akbar and Man Singh, Birbal, and Todar Mal's influence, while correctly noting the limitations of these examples in fully representing Hindu influence. This shows a nuanced understanding of the source material.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage correctly describes Akbar's Rajput recruitment policy, its impact on the nobility's aristocratic character, and the opportunities it provided for social mobility. This showcases knowledge of social dynamics within the Mughal court.


**4.  With reference to the Mughal administrative system at the district level, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal district-level administration under Aurangzeb displayed a lack of resilience, rapidly collapsing after his death, paving the way for the British administration.
2. The tenacity and survival of the Mughal district-level administration is noteworthy, with elements of it indirectly influencing the structure of the subsequent British administration.
3. Aurangzeb's administrative reforms at the district level were primarily focused on enhancing revenue collection and suppressing dissent, neglecting the overall welfare of the populace.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage highlights the *tenacity* and survival of the Mughal district-level administration, directly contradicting the statement. This tests the candidate's ability to identify direct contradictions.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that a considerable portion of the Mughal district-level administration survived and influenced the British system. This assesses factual recall and understanding of historical continuity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the passage mentions Aurangzeb’s focus on consolidating power, it doesn't specifically say his district-level reforms *primarily* focused on revenue and suppression.  This statement makes an unsupported assertion and tests the ability to discern unsupported conclusions.

1. Babur's victory at Panipat marked the complete and immediate subjugation of all opposition in North India, allowing for the rapid consolidation of his empire.
2. The Battle of Khanwa secured Babur's position in the Delhi-Agra region, but he faced continued challenges from Afghan resistance in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar even after his death.
3.  Babur's introduction of a new mode of warfare in India, combining artillery and cavalry effectively, led to the decline of small kingdoms and ushered in an era of larger, resource-rich empires.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, particularly factual recall and analytical ability.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Bahmani Kingdom:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a prominent figure in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented internal reforms including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces called 'tarafs'.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's most significant challenge stemmed from the consistent military threat posed by the Vijayanagara Empire.
3. The cultural legacy of the Bahmani kingdom significantly influenced the development of Mughal culture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms are well-documented, including the division into eight 'tarafs' and the standardization of noble salaries and responsibilities.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bahmani kingdom and the Vijayanagara Empire were regional rivals, the Bahmani kingdom's primary internal challenge wasn't the Vijayanagara Empire's constant military threat but rather factionalism among its nobles (Deccani vs. foreigners).  Statement 3 is correct. The Bahmani kingdom acted as a cultural bridge between north and south India, and its cultural traditions were indeed continued by its successor states and influenced Mughal culture.  The fusion of north and south Indian cultural elements is a key aspect of understanding the development of Mughal cultural practices.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The death of Deva Raya II triggered a series of civil wars and the rise of powerful ministers who exploited the populace.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign is characterized by internal stability, military victories against Orissa and Bijapur, and a flourishing of Telugu literature.
3. The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565 marked the absolute end of the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to its immediate and complete dissolution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the period of internal strife and the growing power of ministers following Deva Raya II's death. This internal weakness significantly contributed to the empire's decline. Statement 2 correctly highlights Krishna Deva Raya's achievements: restoration of order, military successes, and patronage of Telugu literature. His reign is considered a golden age for the empire. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Battle of Bannihatti was a devastating defeat, the Vijayanagara kingdom continued to exist, albeit in a much-reduced form, for almost a century after the battle.  The battle marked a significant turning point, but not the immediate and complete end of the empire. The persistence of the empire after this major defeat is a point often overlooked.



**3. With reference to the administrative policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's revenue reforms involved abandoning Sher Shah Suri's system of land measurement and adopting a system based solely on estimated yields.
2.  The Mansabdari system under Akbar strictly adhered to a purely hereditary principle, with positions passing automatically to the eldest son.
3. Akbar's Rajput policy involved strategic matrimonial alliances and the incorporation of Rajput elites into the Mughal nobility, fostering political stability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's system but later modified and improved it due to its shortcomings, not abandoning it completely.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While heredity played a role in the Mansabdari system, it wasn't strictly hereditary. Appointments were based on merit and loyalty, with promotions and demotions possible.  Statement 3 is correct. Akbar's Rajput policy was a masterful blend of political pragmatism and cultural integration, using marriages and appointments to incorporate Rajput power into the Mughal system.  The success of this policy is a significant aspect of understanding the consolidation of the Mughal empire.  The other options present misleading combinations of correct and incorrect statements.


**4. With reference to the cultural aspects of the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deccan Sultanates were characterized by strict religious orthodoxy, with little to no interaction or cultural exchange between different religious communities.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur was known for his patronage of music, literature (including the composition of *Kitab-i-Nawras*), and his tolerant policies towards different religious groups.
3. The Charminar in Hyderabad was constructed during the reign of Qutb Shahi Sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, and is a prominent example of Deccan architecture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Deccan Sultanates, particularly under rulers like Ibrahim Adil Shah II, were known for their relative religious tolerance and significant cultural exchange between Hindu and Muslim communities.  Statement 2 is correct. Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of arts and his tolerant policies are well-documented. His *Kitab-i-Nawras* showcases the blend of Persian and Indian musical traditions. Statement 3 is correct. The Charminar is a well-known landmark associated with Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah and represents a high point of Deccan architectural style. The other options incorrectly combine factual information with misleading or incorrect details.


**5. With reference to the reign of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies were characterized by a strict adherence to Sunni orthodoxy and a systematic dismantling of the earlier Mughal policy of religious tolerance.
2.  Aurangzeb's military campaigns were uniformly successful, leading to a significant expansion of the Mughal Empire without any setbacks or rebellions.
3. Aurangzeb's administrative reforms included the appointment of Muhtasibs to enforce moral and religious regulations, reflecting his emphasis on social control.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Aurangzeb's reign saw a shift towards a more orthodox interpretation of Islam, leading to policies that impacted the religious freedoms enjoyed under earlier Mughal rulers.  However, it's important to note that the complete dismantling of tolerance is debatable; some levels of religious freedom persisted. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb expanded the empire, his reign also witnessed significant rebellions and military challenges that ultimately weakened the empire.  Statement 3 is correct. The appointment of Muhtasibs to enforce social and religious norms is a well-known aspect of Aurangzeb's reign, illustrating his desire for moral and religious conformity.  The other options wrongly associate Aurangzeb's military success with his religious policies or misrepresent the nature of his administrative reforms.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the complexity of creating difficult and nuanced questions with plausible distractors while maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding source indicators, the number of questions generated may be fewer than initially anticipated within the token limit.

**1. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'Zat' rank determined a Mansabdar's position in the hierarchy and his salary, while the 'Sawar' rank indicated the number of horsemen he was obligated to maintain.
2.  Mansabdars holding a 'Sawar' rank of 1000 or more were designated as nobles (Umara) during the reign of Akbar.
3.  The month-scale system, introduced to address financial strain, directly impacted the jagir's income, leading to a decline in its revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Zat rank represented the Mansabdar's personal status and salary, while the Sawar rank specified his cavalry contingent responsibility.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While high Sawar ranks were associated with nobility, the specific threshold of 1000 was not consistently applied throughout the Mughal period; Akbar's reign saw variations in this threshold, and it changed over time.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The month-scale aimed to reduce the financial burden on the state without directly impacting jagir income. While it affected the number of horsemen a Mansabdar maintained, the jagir's assessed income (jama-dami) remained relatively stable, keeping pace with inflation during Shah Jahan's reign.  The month-scale applied to both jagir-based and cash salaries.


**2. With reference to the Mughal Army's composition, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal army primarily consisted of cavalry, with Mansabdars providing the majority of the force.  Ahadis, also known as gentlemen-troopers, were a highly trusted corps recruited directly by the emperor and received significantly higher salaries than other troopers.
2.  The Mughal infantry, comprising various elements like matchlock-bearers (bandugchi), porters, and servants, lacked the drill and discipline of European infantry, rendering it less effective.
3.  The Mughal artillery, initially relying on foreign expertise from the Ottomans and Portuguese, had significantly improved by Aurangzeb's reign, making it a formidable force in open battles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually accurate descriptions of the Mughal army's structure and capabilities. The Mughal army's reliance on cavalry and the elite Ahadi corps is well documented. The inferiority of the Mughal infantry compared to its European counterparts is also a recognized point of analysis by historians, often cited in relation to the later decline of the Mughal empire.  The evolution of the Mughal artillery, initially reliant on foreign expertise but later achieving a high level of competence, is also historically supported.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Jagirdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revenue department maintained a register indicating the assessed income (jama) of various areas in dams, a unit of currency equivalent to 1/40th of a rupee, called the jama-dami.
2.  The increasing number of Mansabdars and financial constraints led to modifications in the Jagirdari system, including the introduction of the month-scale to adjust salaries and reduce the required number of horsemen.
3.  The shortage of jagirs and the complexities of the system, particularly during Aurangzeb's reign, led to widespread discontent among the nobility and contributed to the weakening of the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Mughal Jagirdari system. The jama-dami register, the modifications due to financial constraints (including the month-scale), and the ultimate crisis and discontent caused by jagir shortages are all well-established historical details. The system's complexities and the resulting challenges to Mughal power during Aurangzeb's reign are frequently discussed in historical analyses.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal nobility:**

1.  Control over land was a crucial marker of social prestige within the Mughal nobility, despite the Mughal bureaucracy's attempts to regulate and control land ownership.
2.  The Mughal nobility, while diverse in its ethnic and religious composition, developed a composite culture, characterized by patronage of art, literature, and scholarship, both Persian and Hindustani.
3.  Although the Mughal nobility received extremely high salaries, their lavish lifestyles and significant expenditures frequently left them in debt, hindering their potential contributions to economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key characteristics of the Mughal nobility. The interplay between feudal land attachment and bureaucratic control is a central theme in understanding Mughal social structures. The nobility's composite nature and its patronage of arts and culture are well-documented.  Finally, the high salaries and extravagant lifestyles of the nobility, often leading to debt, are also consistent with historical accounts.  The combination of these factors is crucial to understanding the dynamics of the Mughal ruling class and its impact on the empire.


**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a prime minister of the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2. The Bahmani kingdom's most challenging problem was the internal strife between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afghans, also called gharibs).
3.  Mahmud Gawan established a renowned madrasa in Bidar, attracting scholars from Iran and Iraq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bahmani Kingdom's history. Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division into tarafs with tarafdars, are well-documented. The internal conflict between the Deccanis (long-established residents) and the foreigners (afghans or gharibs) was a major source of instability, ultimately contributing to the kingdom's fragmentation.  His establishment of a magnificent madrasa in Bidar, known for its size and the scholars it attracted, is also historically accurate.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit crucial details about the Bahmani kingdom's internal dynamics and Mahmud Gawan's contributions.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following Deva Raya II's death, a series of civil wars erupted among contenders for the throne, leading to the weakening of the empire.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya, a Tuluva dynasty ruler, is considered by some historians to be the greatest Vijayanagara ruler, known for his military prowess and administrative reforms.
3.  The Battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) in 1565, is generally considered the end of the Vijayanagara Empire's golden age, although the kingdom persisted for nearly a century afterward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate. The death of Deva Raya II triggered a period of intense internal strife and succession struggles, weakening the empire significantly.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign is widely acknowledged as a high point, marked by military victories and administrative achievements, although the assessment of "greatest ruler" remains a matter of historical interpretation.  The Battle of Bannihatti is a pivotal event signifying the decline of the empire's power and influence, despite the kingdom's continued existence for some time afterward.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all three statements, is the correct choice.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the complex history of the Vijayanagara Empire.


**3.  With reference to the 18th-century South Indian state of Arcot, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arcot dynasty's founders were Anwaruddin Khan and Chanda Sahib.
2. The state of Arcot witnessed prolonged conflicts between the French and the British East India Companies.
3. Decentralization was a significant characteristic of the Arcot state's administration during the 18th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Arcot state did see significant power struggles, the founders mentioned are not historically accurate. The correct founders are Daud Khan Panni and Saadatullah Khan.  Statement 2 is correct; Arcot was indeed a major site of conflict between the British and French East India Companies.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Arcot state's administration in the 18th century was not characterized by decentralization but rather by a centralized structure under the Nawabs. Thus, only statement 2 is correct making option (b) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect information about the founders and administrative structure.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's kings claimed to rule on behalf of the God Virupaksha.
2.  The Orissa rulers, after 1450, launched extensive raids into South India, reaching as far south as Madurai.
3. The Vijayanagara Empire maintained consistent control over the entire Tamil country (including the Cheras) until its fall.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Vijayanagara rulers did associate their rule with the deity Virupaksha. Statement 2 is also correct; Orissa's expansionist activities in South India after 1450 are well-documented.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did control significant parts of South India, including Tamil country, their control was not consistent or absolute over the entire region until their final defeat.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate, making (a) the correct option.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the false statement regarding consistent control over the entire Tamil country.


**5. With reference to the post-Shivaji Maratha succession, consider the following statements:**

1.  After Shivaji's death, the succession struggle primarily involved his son Sambhaji and his widow.
2.  The conflict for succession involved Sambhaji and Bajirao I.
3.  Rajaram, Shivaji's younger son, was not involved in the initial succession crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The immediate succession crisis after Shivaji's death mainly involved his son Sambhaji and the various claimants who saw an opportunity to take power, including factions supporting his widow.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Bajirao I was a later Maratha leader. Statement 3 is also incorrect; Rajaram played a significant role in the later stages of the succession struggles. Therefore, only Statement 1 is accurate and option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include inaccurate details about the timing and key players in the Maratha succession disputes.


**6.  With reference to the Mughal rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Peasant communities under Mughal rule were generally economically homogenous and united.
2.  The Mughal state primarily focused on revenue generation and encouraged crops that maximized this revenue.
3.  Most regions under Mughal rule produced only one crop annually.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; peasant communities were diverse and not uniformly united. Statement 2 is correct; the Mughal revenue system prioritized maximizing revenue, influencing crop choices. Statement 3 is incorrect; many regions produced multiple crops annually.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect assumptions about the homogeneity of peasant communities and the number of annual crops.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Vijayanagara Empire's economy:**

1. The Vijayanagara kingdom's revenue was primarily derived from land tax, with rates varying according to crop type and irrigation methods.
2.  The economic condition of the peasantry under Vijayanagara rule was characterized by widespread prosperity and high standards of living.

Statement 2 is correct; Mahmud Gawan’s tenure saw significant territorial expansion. Statement 3 is correct; the fragmentation of the Bahmani Kingdom resulted in the emergence of these five successor states.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate making (b) the correct option.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of the early Vijayanagara Empire's history. The Sultans of Madurai were indeed significant rivals in the south. The Tungabhadra doab was a crucial contested territory. Harihara II's reign did see expansion towards the east, resulting in conflicts.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) fail to fully capture the scope of the Vijayanagara Empire's early conflicts and territorial ambitions.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the political dynamics of medieval South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Orissa rulers, after 1450, significantly weakened the Vijayanagara Empire through extensive raids reaching as far south as Madurai.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's internal discord, following the death of Deva Raya II, was a major factor contributing to its decline.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom's internal strife, particularly between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afagis), led to its fragmentation into five principalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of medieval South Indian history.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the significant military pressure exerted by the Orissa kingdom on the Vijayanagara Empire after 1450, culminating in raids that reached Madurai. This external pressure exacerbated the internal weaknesses of the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 2 accurately identifies the internal strife within the Vijayanagara Empire following the death of Deva Raya II as a key factor contributing to its decline. The lack of a clear succession system led to prolonged civil wars and weakened the empire's overall strength. Statement 3 correctly describes the fragmentation of the Bahmani kingdom due to intense internal conflicts between the established Deccanis and the foreign (afagis) nobles. This internal conflict undermined the kingdom's unity and ultimately resulted in its disintegration into five successor states.  Therefore, all three statements are historically accurate and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the political landscape of medieval South India.


**2. With reference to the administrative reforms of Mahmud Gawan in the Bahmani kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan divided the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces, each governed by four tarafdars.
2.  The salaries of Bahmani nobles were fixed and could be paid either in cash or by assigning a jagir.
3.  Mahmud Gawan established a madrasa in Bidar, accommodating one thousand teachers and students, who received free food and clothing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Mahmud Gawan implemented significant administrative reforms, statement 1 is inaccurate.  He divided the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), but each taraf was governed by a single tarafdar, not four.  Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Mahmud Gawan implemented a system of fixed salaries for nobles, payable in cash or through jagirs (land grants). This aimed to create a more stable and efficient administrative structure. He also established a renowned madrasa in Bidar, providing free food and clothing to its one thousand teachers and students. This madrasa attracted some of the most celebrated scholars from Iran and Iraq, showcasing his patronage of learning and the arts. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the reign of Krishna Deva Raya in the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign saw the re-establishment of internal law and order after a period of civil war following the death of Deva Raya II.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya successfully repelled the Portuguese, preventing them from gaining significant influence in the Vijayanagara coastal regions.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Krishna Deva Raya successfully restored internal order and stability in the Vijayanagara Empire after a period of internal conflict. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya did engage with the Portuguese, he did not completely repel them; their influence continued to grow in the coastal regions. Statement 3 is partially correct. Krishna Deva Raya did defeat the Bijapur ruler and reclaimed territories up to the Krishna River after a seven-year war, but the statement of "complete defeat" is an oversimplification; Bijapur remained a powerful force. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are largely accurate, although with some nuances.


**4. With reference to the economic and administrative challenges faced by the Mughal Empire in the later part of Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The shortage of jagirs, partly due to Aurangzeb’s retention of productive lands in the khalsa, led to widespread discontent among the mansabdars.
2.  Aurangzeb's virtual ban on new recruitment to the army exacerbated the existing crisis in the mansabdari system.
3.  The annexation of Bijapur and Golconda significantly improved the Mughal Empire's financial stability and resolved the jagir shortage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the challenges faced by the Mughal Empire. The shortage of jagirs (land grants) was a major problem, exacerbated by Aurangzeb's policy of keeping the most productive lands under direct imperial control (khalsa). This shortage, coupled with a virtual ban on new army recruitment, caused significant unrest among the mansabdars (nobles), who relied on jagirs for their income and the maintenance of their troops.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the annexation of Bijapur and Golconda did not resolve the jagir shortage; instead, it created new problems.  The newly acquired Deccan territories were initially less productive and harder to manage, further straining the jagir system.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 correctly represent the economic and administrative pressures during Aurangzeb's later years.


**5. With reference to Akbar's administrative and political strategies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's daily routine involved a public audience (jharoka darshan) followed by a formal court session (darbar) to address public petitions.
2.  Akbar divided his empire into twelve subas in 1580, each administered by a team of officials implementing a system of checks and balances.
3. Akbar's Rajput policy relied solely on matrimonial alliances to secure their loyalty and integration into the Mughal administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Akbar's administrative practices.  Akbar's daily routine included a public appearance at the jharoka (palace balcony) for his subjects to present petitions, followed by a formal darbar (court session) to address these matters. He also implemented a decentralized administrative system by dividing his empire into twelve subas (provinces) in 1580, each governed by a team of officials with clearly defined responsibilities, establishing a system of checks and balances. Statement 3 is incorrect. While matrimonial alliances were a significant part of Akbar's Rajput policy, it was not the sole strategy.  He also employed other strategies, such as granting high offices and providing religious freedom, to foster loyalty and integration.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully accurate representations of Akbar's strategies.


**6. With reference to the treaties concluded by Shah Jahan in the Deccan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1636 treaties with Bijapur and Golconda formally established Mughal suzerainty over the entire Deccan region.
2.  The treaties required Bijapur and Golconda to cease interference in each other's affairs and to refer disputes to the Mughal emperor for arbitration.
3.  The treaties resulted in the immediate and complete subjugation of all Deccani kingdoms under Mughal rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of the outcomes of Shah Jahan's Deccan treaties. The treaties of 1636 with Bijapur and Golconda effectively established Mughal suzerainty over the Deccan, although they did not result in direct Mughal rule over those kingdoms. They also mandated that Bijapur and Golconda resolve their disputes through Mughal arbitration, thereby reducing direct conflict between these Deccani powers.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The treaties did not result in the immediate and complete subjugation of all Deccani kingdoms; Bijapur and Golconda retained a degree of autonomy. The treaties were a strategic move towards establishing Mughal dominance without immediate conquest. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are historically accurate.



**7. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur is known for his patronage of music and his composition of the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a book of songs set to various ragas.
2.  The Charminar in Hyderabad was constructed during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom's cultural influence was limited to the Deccan region and did not significantly impact the development of Mughal culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately highlight cultural achievements of the Deccan states. Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur was indeed a patron of music and composed the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, showcasing the flourishing musical traditions of the Deccan. The Charminar in Hyderabad is a well-known architectural landmark built during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bahmani kingdom played a significant role as a cultural bridge between North and South India, and its cultural traditions significantly influenced the development of Mughal culture. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**8. With reference to the Mughal army during the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal army primarily consisted of cavalry provided by mansabdars, supplemented by a corps of gentleman-troopers (ahadis).
2. The Mughal infantry (piyadgan) was a well-organized and highly disciplined force, comparable to European infantry.
3. Shah Jahan’s army included a large number of war elephants and a well-organized artillery, with both heavy and highly mobile light artillery units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the composition of Shah Jahan's army, with cavalry being the dominant force, provided largely by mansabdars, and supplemented by ahadis. Statement 3 is also accurate; Shah Jahan's army possessed a substantial number of war elephants and a well-developed artillery system with both heavy and light units. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Mughal infantry, while numerous, lacked the organization, discipline, and training of contemporary European infantry.  Their effectiveness was significantly lower. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**9. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari system under Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mansabdari system's efficiency depended on the proper functioning of the dagh (branding) system and the jagirdari system.
2. The month-scale system of salary payment was primarily implemented to address the declining income of jagirs.
3.  The mansabdari system under Shah Jahan was characterized by lax discipline, frequent corruption, and widespread disaffection among the nobles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The efficient operation of the Mughal mansabdari system relied heavily on the dagh (branding of horses) system to prevent fraud and the jagirdari system for land revenue collection.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The month-scale system was not primarily designed to address declining jagir income; it was a means of adjusting the number of troopers a mansabdar was obligated to maintain based on his salary, regardless of whether that salary was paid in cash or through jagirs. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While challenges existed, the mansabdari system under Shah Jahan was generally considered efficient due to his meticulous attention to administrative details and selection of competent officials.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the mansabdari system under Shah Jahan.


**10. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's initial conquest of the Punjab was primarily motivated by the desire to secure a refuge from the Uzbeks and expand his meagre resources from Kabul.
2. Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of the Punjab, consistently supported Babur's campaign against Ibrahim Lodi.
3. The Battle of Panipat (1526) was a decisive victory for Babur due to the effective use of artillery and a strategically sound battlefield position.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Babur's invasion of India was driven by a desire for greater resources than his limited holdings in Kabul provided, also to escape the threat from the Uzbeks. Statement 3 is also accurate. Babur's victory at Panipat was due to a combination of superior battlefield tactics, effective use of artillery, and a well-defended position. Statement 2 is incorrect. Daulat Khan Lodi's support for Babur was inconsistent; he switched allegiances multiple times.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate.


**11. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system was based on accurate measurement of land and a fixed share of the produce for the state.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms included the establishment of new provinces and a complete overhaul of the existing administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate.
3. Sher Shah Suri's construction of sarais along major roads significantly improved trade and communication throughout his empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri implemented a land revenue system based on accurate land measurement and a fixed share of the produce (one-third) for the state. Statement 3 is also correct.  His construction of numerous sarais (roadside inns) along major roads facilitated trade and communication.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sher Shah Suri did not completely overhaul the administrative structure; he made improvements to the existing system of parganas and sarkars, but it was not a complete overhaul.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**12.  With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Chittor marked the beginning of the complete subjugation of all Rajput states under Mughal rule.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati saw Rana Pratap decisively defeat the Mughal forces led by Raja Man Singh.
3.  Akbar's Rajput policy involved a combination of military pressure, matrimonial alliances, and religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. Akbar's Rajput policy was a multifaceted strategy involving military pressure, strategic matrimonial alliances, and a policy of religious tolerance to integrate Rajput rulers into the Mughal administration. Statement 1 is incorrect; while Akbar subjugated many Rajput states, not all were completely under Mughal control during his reign. Statement 2 is incorrect; Rana Pratap did not decisively defeat the Mughals at Haldighati; while the battle was hard-fought, the Mughals ultimately prevailed, though Pratap continued his resistance through guerrilla warfare.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the events and policies of the early Mughal period.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's daily routine included a public appearance at the jharoka, followed by an open darbar (diwan-i-am).
2.  Confidential consultations with ministers generally took place in a chamber near Akbar's bathing apartment, later known as the ghusal khana.
3.  The twelve subas established in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each headed by a governor (subedar) and other key officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative system.  The jharoka darshan was a crucial part of Akbar's public image and accessibility, allowing direct interaction with his subjects. The ghusal khana evolved into a chamber for private consultations with ministers, highlighting the importance of informal channels in decision-making. The division of the empire into twelve subas, with a defined administrative structure in each province, shows Akbar's focus on centralized control and efficient governance, a key feature of his reign.  There's no evidence to suggest any of these statements are incorrect.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber, was solely motivated by political expediency and had no lasting impact on relations between the Mughals and Rajputs.
2. The Mughal policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, initiated by Humayun, aimed to soothe the minds of powerful zamindars and consolidate Mughal power.
3. Akbar’s Rajput policy was entirely dependent on matrimonial alliances;  no Rajput rulers remained in his favor without such an alliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  Humayun's and Akbar's matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers were a significant part of their strategy to integrate powerful Rajput clans into the Mughal empire.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai did indeed have lasting consequences, leading to the elevation of Bhara Mal and his family within the Mughal nobility.  Statement 3 is also false; Akbar maintained cordial relations with several Rajput rulers without matrimonial alliances, demonstrating a more nuanced approach than solely relying on marital ties.


**3. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax was primarily driven by a desire to improve the Mughal treasury, as the tax was a significant source of revenue.
2.  The abolition of the pilgrim tax and the practice of forcible conversion of prisoners of war demonstrated Akbar’s commitment to religious tolerance.
3. The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for Muslim theological discussions, was later opened to representatives of various faiths, fostering interfaith dialogue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Akbar's abolition of the pilgrim tax and forcible conversions signified his commitment to religious tolerance and his rejection of religiously motivated coercion. The Ibadat Khana's evolution into a space for interfaith dialogue reflects Akbar's intellectual curiosity and desire for religious harmony. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the jizya tax did generate revenue, its abolition was primarily motivated by Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his aim to create a more unified empire. The tax was not a significant source of revenue compared to the land revenue.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal nobility:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus constituted approximately 84% of the Mughal nobility.
2.  Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal were close confidantes of Akbar, while Raja Todar Mal held significant influence in revenue administration.
3. The Mughal nobility, while diverse in ethnicity and religion, remained largely a feudal class with land as its primary source of income.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Man Singh, Birbal, and Todar Mal's roles highlight the inclusion of Hindus in Akbar's court and administration. The Mughal nobility's feudal nature, with land as its main source of income, is well-documented.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the proportion of Hindus in the nobility under Akbar was significantly lower than 84%, closer to 16% according to some calculations, though their influence belied their numerical representation.


**5. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1. The mansabdari system, while initially having a single rank, was later divided into 'zar' and 'sawar' components, signifying personal status and the number of cavalrymen to be maintained, respectively.
2. The 'dagh' system involved branding horses with imperial marks to ensure the quality and authenticity of the cavalry.
3. The 'month-scale' system, introduced to address financial constraints, reduced the number of troopers a mansabdar had to maintain but did not directly affect the jagir's income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Mughal administrative system. The evolution of the mansabdari system from a single rank to the 'zar' and 'sawar' components is well-documented. The 'dagh' system was crucial for maintaining the quality and accountability of the Mughal cavalry.  The 'month-scale' system aimed to manage financial constraints by reducing the number of troopers a mansabdar had to maintain without directly impacting the jagir's income, though it did indirectly affect a mansabdar's ability to fully support his contingent.


**6. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The crisis in the jagirdari system, characterized by shortages of jagirs and difficulties in revenue collection, significantly contributed to the weakening of the Mughal nobility.
2. Aurangzeb's policy of virtual ban on new recruitment exacerbated the existing tensions within the nobility, leading to discontent among the aspiring nobles.
3. The decline of the Mughal Empire was primarily due to the cessation of immigration from Central Asia, leading to a lack of competent administrators and soldiers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the challenges faced by the Mughal Empire during Aurangzeb's reign. The jagirdari crisis severely strained the Mughal nobility, and the lack of new recruitment fueled discontent. Statement 3 is incorrect; the decline was not primarily due to the end of Central Asian immigration, but rather a combination of internal factors, including the jagirdari crisis, Aurangzeb's religious policies, and his prolonged Deccan campaigns.  By the time of Aurangzeb, the bulk of the nobility consisted of those born in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative structure and daily routine. The jharoka darshan was a crucial part of Akbar's public image, allowing direct interaction with his subjects.  The ghusal khana evolved into a chamber for private consultations with ministers, showcasing the emperor's structured approach to governance. The division of the empire into twelve subas with a defined hierarchy of officials represents a key administrative reform, establishing a system of checks and balances within the provinces.  This decentralized yet controlled system facilitated efficient governance across a vast empire. There is no inaccuracy in any statement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit crucial elements of Akbar's administrative system.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal, ruler of Amber, was solely motivated by strategic political gain, rather than any personal affection.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 is a well-documented example of his policy of religious tolerance.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while the marriage had strategic benefits, it's inaccurate to assume it lacked personal elements.  Akbar's relationship with his Rajput wives and their families was complex and went beyond mere political expediency.  Statement 2 is false because Akbar's Rajput policy was multifaceted.  While matrimonial alliances played a role, he also accepted the submission of Rajput rulers without such alliances, demonstrating a pragmatic approach beyond just marriage.

**3. With reference to the Mughal-Rajput relations during Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Haldighati was primarily a religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims.
2.  Rana Pratap's defiance of Akbar continued even after most Rajput states had accepted Mughal suzerainty.
3.  Akbar's success in consolidating his alliance with Rajput rulers was solely due to his military prowess.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. Rana Pratap's resistance to Akbar persisted even after many other Rajput states had submitted, showcasing his unwavering commitment to independence. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Battle of Haldighati was not solely a religious conflict. It involved diverse groups, including Afghans and Bhil tribes, highlighting the complex political dynamics of the time.  Statement 3 is false because Akbar's success with the Rajputs resulted from a combination of factors, including military might, diplomatic skill, religious tolerance, and strategic matrimonial alliances. His approach was multifaceted, not solely reliant on military strength.  Option (b) accurately reflects the only completely true statement.


**4.  With reference to the Deccan and South India during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's treaties with Bijapur and Golconda in 1636 established complete Mughal control over the entire Deccan region.
2.  The treaties of 1636 resulted in the immediate cessation of all conflicts and internal strife within Bijapur and Golconda.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is completely accurate. The Deccani states fostered a rich cultural environment with notable achievements in various art forms. Statement 1 is incorrect because while the treaties of 1636 significantly expanded Mughal influence in the Deccan, they did not immediately result in complete control.  Internal conflicts and power struggles continued within the Deccani states even after the treaties. Statement 2 is false because internal conflicts and power struggles persisted within Bijapur and Golconda despite the treaties.  Option (a) correctly identifies the only fully accurate statement.



**5. With reference to the Mughal administrative system during the reign of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility under Jahangir and Shah Jahan was entirely composed of foreigners.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The Mughal nobility enjoyed high salaries but also faced significant expenses maintaining lavish lifestyles. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Mughal nobility was not exclusively composed of foreigners.  It included a significant proportion of Indians, both Hindus and Muslims, who rose to prominence through service. Statement 2 is false because while the mansabdari system aimed for efficiency, it wasn't purely meritocratic.  Factors like ethnicity, family connections, and loyalty to the emperor also influenced promotions and appointments. Option (b) accurately highlights the single correct statement.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Akbar's religious evolution from orthodoxy to a more inclusive approach is well-documented. The Ibadat Khana initially focused on Muslim scholars but later expanded to include representatives from various faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The 'ahadis' were a trusted corps with diverse functions. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Mughal army's core strength was its cavalry, not infantry.  The infantry was less organized and efficient compared to European counterparts. Statement 2 is false because the Mughal artillery, while improving, was not consistently superior to European artillery during the seventeenth century. European advancements in firearms and artillery tactics gradually surpassed the Mughals. Option (a) correctly identifies the only fully accurate statement.


**8. With reference to the economic and social conditions during the Mughal empire, consider the following statements:**

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The Mughal nobility actively participated in commercial activities, including trade and moneylending. Statement 1 is incorrect because the prosperity of the ruling classes did not significantly translate into improved living conditions for the peasant and worker classes.  A vast disparity existed between the rich and the poor. Statement 2 is false because new land ownership rights could be acquired in Mughal India through cultivation of wasteland.  Hereditary rights were important, but not the only way to gain land ownership. Option (a) accurately identifies the single correct statement.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, demanding a deep understanding of the historical context and avoiding easily guessable answers.


**1. With reference to Shivaji's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shivaji's coronation at Raigarh signified his elevation above other Maratha chiefs and established him as an independent ruler capable of negotiating treaties on equal footing with the Deccan Sultans.
2.  The Karnataka expedition, though initially successful with a treaty securing a substantial subsidy, ultimately strained relations with the Qutb Shah due to Shivaji's refusal to share the spoils.
3.  Shivaji's administrative system, while borrowing from Deccan states, featured the Ashtapradhan, a powerful council of ministers each directly accountable to the ruler.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's coronation at Raigarh was a pivotal moment, elevating his status beyond a mere jagirdar and solidifying his position as an independent king. This allowed him to engage in diplomatic interactions with the Deccan sultanates as an equal rather than a rebellious subordinate.  The coronation also aimed to quell dissent among other Maratha chiefs who viewed him as an upstart.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Karnataka expedition initially yielded a favorable treaty with the Qutb Shah, including a significant annual subsidy. However, Shivaji's breach of the agreement by not sharing the conquered territories and booty created a rift and damaged the relationship.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Shivaji's administration did borrow from the Deccan, the Ashtapradhan was not a council in the traditional sense. Each minister was directly responsible to Shivaji, not to a collective body.  The system lacked the checks and balances of a true council of ministers.  The description of the Ashtapradhan's roles and responsibilities presented in the text accurately reflects the individual responsibilities of the ministers, but misrepresents their collective function.


**2. With reference to Akbar's reign and policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's daily schedule involved a public appearance at the jharoka, followed by an open darbar, and then private consultations with ministers in the ghusal khana.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy involved only matrimonial alliances, strengthening his ties with powerful Rajput rulers and ensuring their loyalty through family bonds.
3.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for religious discussions among Muslim theologians, was later opened to people of all faiths, leading to debates on fundamental religious tenets and ultimately causing disillusionment among orthodox elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's daily routine, highlighting his efforts to be accessible to both the public and his ministers.  The jharoka darshan was a crucial element of his public image, while the ghusal khana served as a space for confidential discussions with his advisors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances as a significant tool in his Rajput policy (marrying into prominent Rajput families), it wasn’t his *only* strategy. He also employed other methods, such as granting high mansabs and positions of power to Rajput nobles regardless of marriage, showcasing his pragmatic approach to consolidating power and forging alliances.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ibadat Khana initially functioned as a space for discussions among Muslim theologians. However, Akbar later expanded its scope to include representatives of various faiths, fostering interfaith dialogues. This broadened approach, while intended to promote religious harmony and understanding, ultimately alienated orthodox Muslim elements who viewed Akbar's actions as a threat to Islamic orthodoxy.


**3. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bahmani kingdom's internal strife among Deccani and foreign nobles led to its fragmentation into five independent sultanates, including Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar.
2.  Mahmud Gawan, a significant figure in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented administrative reforms including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) and a standardized salary system for nobles.
3.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked a peak in Vijayanagara's power, with military victories against Orissa and Bijapur, but he neglected naval development, leaving the empire vulnerable to Portuguese influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the downfall of the Bahmani kingdom, highlighting the role of internal conflicts between established Deccani nobles and foreign newcomers in its disintegration into smaller, independent sultanates. This internal power struggle weakened the kingdom's central authority, paving the way for its fragmentation.

Statement 2 accurately portrays Mahmud Gawan's significant contributions to the Bahmani kingdom's administration. His reforms included the creation of a standardized salary system for nobles, along with the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) to improve governance and administration. These reforms aimed to streamline revenue collection and strengthen the kingdom's administrative structure.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the achievements and shortcomings of Krishna Deva Raya's reign.  His military successes against Orissa and Bijapur were significant, but his neglect of naval development proved to be a strategic weakness, exposing the empire to growing Portuguese influence. This oversight highlights the limitations of his focus on land-based power and his failure to counter the growing naval dominance of the Portuguese.


**4. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a masterpiece of architecture, representing a blend of earlier and later architectural styles.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system involved a detailed measurement of cultivated land and a crop-wise assessment of peasant dues, later adopted and modified by Akbar.
3.  Sher Shah Suri's religious policy was characterized by extreme religious intolerance and persecution of non-Muslims, exemplified by the collection of jizya and the destruction of Hindu temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is indeed a remarkable architectural achievement, showcasing a transition between architectural styles. It's considered a significant landmark in the history of Indian architecture.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system was notable for its emphasis on accurate measurement of cultivated land and a detailed assessment of peasant dues based on crop yields. This system was later adopted and further refined by Akbar, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri did collect jizya from non-Muslims, his religious policy wasn't marked by extreme intolerance or widespread persecution of Hindus. The text mentions that he was not a religious bigot, and while he didn't initiate any new liberal policies, the description lacks evidence of temple destruction or widespread persecution.  The statement presents an overly negative and inaccurate portrayal of his religious policies.



**5. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and its impact on the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's negotiations with the Marathas regarding the release of Shahu, Shivaji's son, ultimately failed due to his uncertainty about the Marathas' intentions.
2. The decline of the Mughal Empire after Aurangzeb's death was solely due to the incompetence and infighting among his successors and had no relation to the policies adopted during his reign.
3. Aurangzeb's religious policies, while orthodox, led to the alienation of some Hindu sections and did not enhance the loyalty of Muslims to the empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Aurangzeb's attempts to reconcile with the Marathas by releasing Shahu were unsuccessful due to his mistrust of their intentions. This highlights the complexities of his relationship with the Marathas and his inability to forge a lasting peace.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the incompetence and infighting among Aurangzeb's successors undoubtedly contributed to the Mughal decline, it's inaccurate to attribute the decline solely to post-Aurangzeb events.  His own policies, particularly his religious policies and the resulting alienation of certain segments of the population, significantly weakened the empire's foundations.

Statement 3 is correct. Aurangzeb's religious policies, while rooted in his orthodox beliefs, caused significant resentment among some Hindu groups.  The re-imposition of jizya and the destruction of temples alienated a significant portion of the population.  Furthermore, his policies did not effectively bolster the loyalty of the Muslim population to the empire, highlighting the limitations of his approach.  The statement accurately reflects the complex and multifaceted nature of his religious policies and their significant impact on the empire's stability.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; the marriage to Harkha Bai strengthened the Mughal-Kachwaha alliance. Statement 3 is also correct; while many Rajput states accepted Mughal suzerainty, Rana Pratap's resistance was a significant factor in the overall political landscape. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy was multifaceted; while matrimonial alliances were important, they were not the sole method employed to garner Rajput support.  Akbar also used other strategies like granting high mansabs and showing religious tolerance to win over Rajput rulers.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate depictions of Akbar's religious policies.  The abolition of the jizya tax is well-documented, demonstrating his commitment to religious tolerance. The Ibadat Khana's evolution from a Muslim-only theological discussion forum to a space inclusive of all religions reflects his open-mindedness.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Akbar engaged in religious debates and displayed syncretic tendencies, he never formally claimed prophethood.  This statement serves as a critical distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of Akbar's religious stance and avoiding generalizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The mansabdari system, while primarily military, did include high-ranking civil officials.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the system encompassed both military and civil officials.  Statement 3 is also incorrect because mansabdars held positions across various ranks within the administration, not exclusively high positions. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuanced nature of the mansabdari system, requiring precise knowledge to differentiate between the various aspects of this crucial Mughal administrative institution.


**7. With reference to the relations between the Mughal Empire and the Rajput states, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of Mughal-Rajput relations.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor remained loyal to Akbar even without marriage alliances, showing the diversity of Akbar's strategies.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax is historical fact.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Mewar, under Rana Pratap, notably resisted Mughal suzerainty. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the various Rajput states' responses to Akbar's policies, requiring specific knowledge rather than broad generalizations about Rajput-Mughal relations.


**8. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of the cultural contributions of the Deccan states.  Ali Adil Shah II's patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi showcases the syncretic nature of the Deccan's cultural landscape.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II's musical contributions are well-documented through his work, the Kitab-i-Nawras. Golconda's role in the development of Dakhini Urdu is also historically established.  The question demands factual recall of specific rulers and their cultural contributions, assessing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Deccan's cultural history.


**9. With reference to  Mughal relations with Central Asia, consider the following statements:**

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The Hindu Kush mountains functioned as a practical border, although not formally agreed upon.  Shah Jahan's Balkh campaign was directly responding to Uzbek threats to Kabul.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Akbar's acquisition of Qandhar was primarily a strategic and defensive move, not part of a formal agreement to partition Persia. The question requires the candidate to understand the complex geopolitical dynamics of the Mughal Empire's relationship with Central Asia, requiring specific knowledge of the motivations and outcomes of various military campaigns.

(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The approximate percentage of Hindus in Akbar's nobility is supported by historical data.  The increase in Hindu representation within the nobility during Aurangzeb's reign is also verifiable. Statement 2 is incorrect; while there was a significant influx of foreigners, the Mughal nobility eventually became largely composed of individuals born in India. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the composition and evolution of the Mughal nobility, demanding precise knowledge of the proportions of different groups at various points in Mughal history, countering potential misconceptions.


**1. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram represents a culmination of pre-Mughal architectural styles and a precursor to later Mughal styles.
2. The Purana Qila in Delhi, a remnant of Sher Shah Suri's city, showcases a blend of Afghan and pre-existing Indian architectural elements.
3. Sher Shah Suri's architectural patronage primarily focused on grand mosques, neglecting other public works like gardens or water structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a significant architectural achievement, blending earlier styles to create a unique structure that influenced subsequent architectural developments.  It's considered a transition point between pre-Mughal and Mughal styles, reflecting a synthesis of existing techniques and aesthetics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Purana Qila (Old Fort) in Delhi, built by Sher Shah Suri, is a testament to his architectural vision. While much of his planned city is lost, the fort and its mosque stand as evidence of his incorporation of existing structures and his own architectural preferences, resulting in a blend of styles.  It demonstrates the interaction between Afghan architectural influences and the pre-existing architectural traditions of the region.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the text highlights Sher Shah's mosque within the Purana Qila, it also mentions his patronage of learned men and the completion of significant literary works during his reign. This suggests a broader patronage extending beyond solely religious architecture, indicating a more holistic approach to cultural development.  The statement wrongly limits his architectural focus.


**2. With reference to the early Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's birth occurred during Humayun's exile in Persia, significantly impacting his early life and upbringing.
2. Bairam Khan, Akbar's tutor and regent, consolidated the Mughal territories after Humayun's death, significantly expanding the empire's reach.
3. Hemu's defeat at the Second Battle of Panipat was a decisive victory for Akbar, effectively securing his control over the empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's birth took place in Amarkot, not during Humayun's exile in Persia. While Humayun's exile did shape Akbar's early life, the location of his birth is crucial to understanding his initial years and the political context surrounding his birth.  The statement incorrectly places his birth in Persia.

Statement 2 is correct.  After Humayun's death, Bairam Khan played a vital role in consolidating the Mughal empire. He acted as regent during Akbar's minority and successfully led Mughal forces against the Afghans, expanding the empire's control across various regions.  His strategic military and political decisions were crucial to the empire's stability.

Statement 3 is correct. The Second Battle of Panipat was a pivotal moment in the consolidation of Akbar's rule. Hemu's defeat marked a significant turning point, effectively ending the Afghan challenge and paving the way for Akbar to establish his authority across North India.  The battle's outcome was instrumental in shaping the future trajectory of the Mughal Empire.


**3. With reference to Akbar's reign and policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax demonstrated his commitment to religious tolerance and equality among his subjects, regardless of faith.
2.  Akbar's marriage alliances with Rajput rulers solely aimed at strengthening his military power and expanding his territorial control.
3. The Ibadat Khana's establishment primarily served as a platform for religious debates and discussions, fostering Akbar's intellectual curiosity and religious syncretism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The abolition of the jizya tax was a significant step towards religious tolerance and demonstrated Akbar's commitment to treating all his subjects equally, irrespective of their religious beliefs. This policy aimed at promoting social harmony within his vast and diverse empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Akbar's Rajput alliances did strengthen his military and expand his influence, the marriages also served other purposes, including establishing political stability and fostering cultural exchange between different communities.  The statement oversimplifies the complexities of Akbar's diplomatic strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ibadat Khana, or Hall of Prayer, was established by Akbar to facilitate debates and discussions on religious and philosophical matters. It reflected his keen interest in intellectual pursuits and his desire to understand different religious perspectives, contributing to the development of his unique religious syncretism.


**4. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mansabdari system, a crucial element of the Mughal administration, primarily focused on efficient revenue collection and land management.
2. The Subas, or provinces, were governed by Subedars who enjoyed absolute autonomy, independent of the central government's control.
3.  The Diwan, Bakhshi, and Sadr were key administrative officials in the Mughal provinces, responsible for finance, military, and religious affairs, respectively.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mansabdari system did contribute to revenue collection indirectly through the assignment of land revenue responsibilities to Mansabdars, its primary function was the organization and management of the Mughal military and nobility. The system involved assigning ranks (Mansabs) and responsibilities, including military command and administrative duties, to officials.  The statement misrepresents the primary function of the Mansabdari system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Subedars, while governors of the provinces, were not entirely autonomous. They were subject to the central government's oversight and accountable for their actions and performance. The Mughal administration maintained a centralized structure, with the emperor wielding ultimate authority.  The statement incorrectly portrays the Subedars as having unlimited power.

Statement 3 is correct. The Diwan, Bakhshi, and Sadr held crucial administrative positions within the Mughal provinces. The Diwan managed the finances, the Bakhshi oversaw military affairs, and the Sadr handled religious matters. These officials played key roles in maintaining order and administering the provinces under the emperor's overall authority.  The statement accurately describes the roles of these key officials.


**5. With reference to the Rajput policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy primarily relied on military conquest and subjugation, with little emphasis on diplomatic alliances or inter-marriage.
2. The Battle of Haldighati resulted in Rana Pratap's decisive defeat and the complete subjugation of Mewar under Mughal rule.
3.  Akbar's success in integrating Rajput rulers into his administration involved granting them significant autonomy and high positions of authority.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy was a multifaceted approach combining military might with astute diplomacy and strategic alliances through marriage and other concessions. While military actions were employed, diplomacy and strategic partnerships played an equally important role in integrating Rajput states into the Mughal Empire.  The statement ignores the diplomatic aspect of Akbar’s policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Battle of Haldighati was a significant engagement, it did not result in Rana Pratap's complete defeat or the immediate subjugation of Mewar.  Rana Pratap continued his resistance against the Mughals through guerrilla warfare even after Haldighati.  Mewar remained largely independent despite Mughal pressure.  The statement misrepresents the outcome of the battle.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar successfully integrated many Rajput rulers into his administration by granting them high positions, significant autonomy within their territories, and treating them with respect and honor. This policy fostered loyalty and cooperation, strengthening the Mughal Empire's political and military standing. The statement accurately reflects the key elements of Akbar’s successful Rajput integration strategy.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history and architecture.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the architectural innovations introduced during the early Turkish period in North India:**

1. The widespread use of the arch and dome in Turkish architecture was a unique invention of the Turkic or Muslim world.
2.  The arabesque style of decoration, characterized by geometrical and floral designs combined with Quranic inscriptions, completely eschewed any pre-existing Indian motifs.
3. The construction of large halls with clear views, facilitated by arches and domes, was primarily employed in mosques and had limited application in palaces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. Statement 1 is false because the arch and dome, while extensively used and developed by the Turks in India, were not their invention.  They were adopted and adapted from earlier Roman and Byzantine traditions, passed down through the Arab world. Statement 2 is incorrect as the arabesque style, while predominantly featuring geometric and floral patterns and Quranic verses, did incorporate pre-existing Hindu motifs like the bell motif, the 'el' motif, swastika, and lotus.  The integration of these elements demonstrates a cultural exchange rather than a complete rejection of Indian artistic traditions. Statement 3 is also false; while mosques benefited from the architectural advantages of arches and domes, creating spacious prayer halls, the same features were also employed in palaces to create large, open spaces for assemblies and gatherings. The clear view offered by these architectural elements was beneficial in both contexts.


**2. With reference to the Qutub Minar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Qutub Minar was originally constructed as a Sufi shrine dedicated to Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki.
2.  The construction of the Qutub Minar was solely attributed to Qutbuddin Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate.
3. The unique aesthetic effect of the Qutub Minar arises from the skillful integration of balconies, the use of red and white sandstone and marble, and a ribbed effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. The Qutub Minar was initially built as part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, not as a Sufi shrine dedicated to Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki, refuting statement 1.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; while Aibak initiated the construction, Iltutmish completed it, highlighting a collaborative effort rather than sole attribution to Aibak. Statement 3 correctly identifies the key elements contributing to the Minar's distinctive aesthetic appeal: the projecting yet integrated balconies, the contrasting use of red and white sandstone and marble, and the visually striking ribbed effect. These features showcase the sophisticated architectural skills of the period.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent during the Tughlaq period in the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "batter," a characteristic feature of Tughlaq architecture, involves sloping walls to enhance the building's visual appeal and aesthetic grace.
2. Firuz Tughlaq's buildings notably incorporated the "batter" technique extensively, demonstrating a continuation of the architectural style established by his predecessors.
3. The Tughlaq period witnessed a unique architectural fusion, combining arch principles with lintel and beam construction methods, particularly evident in Firuz Tughlaq’s buildings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  Statement 1 accurately describes the "batter" technique—sloping walls used in Tughlaq architecture, contributing to an impression of strength and solidity, not just visual appeal. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the batter was used by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and Muhammad Tughlaq, Firuz Tughlaq's structures notably *lacked* this feature, marking a departure from the earlier Tughlaq style.  Statement 3 correctly points out the innovative combination of arch and lintel-beam construction methods, a hallmark of Firuz Tughlaq’s architecture, reflecting a blend of different architectural traditions.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was always a prerequisite for securing their allegiance and ensuring their submission to Mughal authority.
2.  The abolition of the jizya tax under Akbar was primarily motivated by his personal religious beliefs and had no significant political implications for consolidating his empire.
3.  Akbar's special relationship with the Kachhwaha ruler, Bhara Mal, was solely based on matrimonial alliances and did not extend to other forms of political patronage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is false because while Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances strategically, it wasn't an absolute precondition for Rajput submission.  Some Rajput rulers remained loyal without such alliances. Statement 2 is incorrect; the abolition of the jizya tax was a significant political move, aimed at fostering goodwill and reducing discontent among the Hindu population, thereby strengthening the Mughal empire. It wasn't solely based on religious conviction. Statement 3 is also false; Akbar's relationship with Bhara Mal involved various forms of patronage beyond marriage, including high offices for Bhara Mal's family, showcasing a multifaceted approach to consolidating his alliances with the Rajputs.


**5. With reference to the religious movements of the period 800-1200 CE in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and ritualistic worship, rejecting emotional devotion and personal connection with the divine.
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava, strongly advocated for the continuation of the caste system and traditional Vedic rituals.
3.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to both Buddhism and Jainism by emphasizing the oneness of God and the created world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Bhakti movement emphasized emotional devotion, love, and a personal relationship with God, directly contrasting with austere practices. Statement 2 is false because the Lingayat movement, a significant reformist movement, actively opposed the caste system and rejected many traditional Vedic rituals. Statement 3 accurately reflects Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, which indeed challenged Buddhism and Jainism through its non-dualistic philosophy and emphasis on the unity of Brahman (God) and Atman (self).  This philosophical framework offered a powerful counter-narrative to the prevalent Buddhist and Jain concepts.


**1. With reference to Chola architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style of temple architecture, characterized by multiple storeys above the garbhagriha,  flourished primarily in South India during the Chola period.
2.  The Brihadiswara Temple at Thanjavur, also known as the Rajaraja Temple, exemplifies the Dravida style and features the installation of royal images in the courtyards.
3.  Chola temples often incorporated mandapas, pillared halls with elaborately carved pillars and flat roofs, serving as audience halls and spaces for ceremonial dances performed by devadasis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Chola temple architecture.  The Dravida style, with its distinctive multi-storied vimana above the sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha), is a defining characteristic of Chola architecture and was largely confined to South India. The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by Rajaraja I, stands as a prime example of this style, showcasing its grandeur and complexity.  The inclusion of royal images in temple courtyards was a common practice under the Cholas, further reinforcing the temple's role as a symbol of royal power and piety. Finally, the presence of mandapas, serving as versatile spaces for both religious and secular activities, is a key feature found in many Chola temples. The devadasis, women dedicated to temple service, played a significant role in these ceremonial spaces.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all three statements is the correct answer.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola Empire's extensive network of royal roads facilitated both trade and military movements.
2.  The Chola rulers primarily relied on land tax as their sole source of revenue.
3. Gigantic trade guilds within the Chola empire engaged in extensive overseas trade, reaching as far as Java and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola administration invested significantly in building a network of royal roads that proved crucial for both trade and the swift movement of the army, ensuring efficient administration and economic activity throughout the empire. Statement 2 is incorrect. While land tax was a significant source of revenue for the Chola rulers, they also collected revenue through tolls on trade, taxes on professions, and importantly, through the plunder of neighboring territories. This diversified revenue stream contributed significantly to the empire's wealth and enabled large-scale construction projects. Statement 3 is correct. The Chola period witnessed the rise of powerful trade guilds that actively participated in extensive overseas trade, establishing trade links with regions as distant as Java and Sumatra.  These guilds played a vital role in the empire's economic prosperity, connecting it to wider regional and international trade networks. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Chola administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola army consisted solely of infantry, armed primarily with spears.
2. The basic unit of Chola administration was the Nadu, comprising several villages with close kinship and social ties.
3. The Chola state was divided into four Mandalams or provinces, sometimes governed by princes of the royal family.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Chola infantry was a significant component of their military, their army also included elephants and cavalry, reflecting a more complex military structure than solely infantry-based.  Statement 2 is correct. The Nadu served as the fundamental administrative unit in the Chola empire, encompassing multiple villages bound together by kinship ties and shared social structures. This decentralized administrative approach was effective in managing the vast expanse of the empire. Statement 3 is correct. The Chola kingdom was divided into four Mandalams or provinces, a significant administrative division.  The appointment of princes as governors of these provinces was a common practice, reinforcing royal authority and ensuring efficient control over the outlying regions. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate, making option (b) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Chola capital, Gangaikondacholapuram, consider the following statements:**

1. Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajendra I, served as a significant port city facilitating extensive maritime trade.
2.  Detailed architectural plans and blueprints of the palaces within Gangaikondacholapuram have survived.
3.  Gangaikondacholapuram is currently a small village near Thanjavur, with only limited remnants of its former grandeur.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gangaikondacholapuram was a significant city built by Rajendra Chola I to commemorate his victory over the Ganga, its primary function wasn't as a major port city for maritime trade.  The Chola maritime trade was largely centered around other coastal cities. Statement 2 is incorrect. Unfortunately, no detailed architectural plans or blueprints of the palaces within Gangaikondacholapuram have survived. The passage explicitly mentions the lack of surviving palaces from the Chola period. Statement 3 is correct. Gangaikondacholapuram, once a major Chola capital, is now reduced to a small village near Thanjavur, with only scattered ruins remaining to indicate its past magnificence. This reflects the passage of time and the erosion of historical sites. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to Chola cultural life, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola period witnessed a decline in the popularity of Sanskrit literature.
2. The Chola rulers actively patronized the arts and letters, with Sanskrit retaining its status as a language of high culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While regional languages gained prominence, Sanskrit continued to hold significant importance as a language of high culture and scholarship during the Chola period, receiving royal patronage. Statement 2 is correct. The Chola rulers were known for their patronage of arts and letters, with Sanskrit remaining a prestigious language used by scholars and the court.  Statement 3 is correct. The Chola period is regarded as a golden age for Tamil literature, largely due to the works of Kamban, whose Ramayana is considered a monumental achievement in Tamil classical literature.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Chola Empire's religious landscape:**

1.  The Chola rulers primarily patronized the construction of Buddhist monasteries.
2.  The Chola rulers erected numerous Siva and Vishnu temples, often documenting their victories through inscriptions on temple walls.
3.  Temples in the Chola Empire served solely as places of worship and held no social or economic significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cholas did interact with Buddhists (as seen in their relationship with Srivijaya), their primary religious patronage was directed towards the construction of Shaivite and Vaishnavite temples. Statement 2 is correct. The Chola rulers were renowned for their extensive temple-building programs, dedicating numerous structures to Siva and Vishnu.  A key feature of these temples was the practice of inscribing their walls with detailed accounts of military victories and royal achievements, providing invaluable historical records. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Chola temples were far more than mere places of worship. They served as significant centers of social and economic activity, holding land grants, engaging in business, and supporting various community initiatives.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the right answer.


**7. With reference to the Chola's relationship with other kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola Empire maintained consistently peaceful relations with the Chalukyas of Kalyani.
2. Rajendra I led Chola armies on an expedition across Kalinga to Bengal, defeating local kings and adopting the title "Gangaikondachola."
3. The Chola navy dominated the Bay of Bengal, leading to the conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and other places in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cholas had a complex and often conflictual relationship with the Chalukyas of Kalyani, engaging in prolonged struggles for control over territories like Vengi.  This rivalry significantly impacted the political landscape of South India. Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's expedition to Bengal, crossing the Ganga river and defeating local rulers, was a significant military achievement that led to his adoption of the title "Gangaikondachola." This title commemorates his conquest and expansion of the Chola empire. Statement 3 is correct. The Chola navy was a powerful force, establishing dominance over the Bay of Bengal. This naval strength enabled the conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and other territories in Southeast Asia, extending the Chola influence across the maritime trade routes. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


**8.  With reference to Chola governance, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chola king held supreme authority, they did not rule alone. They were assisted by a council of ministers who provided advice and guidance on matters of governance. This council played a crucial role in the administration of the empire. Statement 2 is correct. The Chola empire is known for its sophisticated system of village self-governance, with assemblies like the Sabha (in Brahman villages) and the Ur (in other villages) playing a crucial role in local administration. These assemblies managed village affairs, collected taxes, and maintained law and order. Statement 3 is correct.  The Chola rulers implemented detailed land surveys to accurately assess landholdings and determine the government's share of the revenue.  However, the exact proportion of the revenue collected by the state remains uncertain due to limited surviving records.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Temple building activity did not cease after the Chola decline; it continued under successor dynasties like the Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Hoysalas.  Statement 2 is correct.  Both the Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Hoysalas were significant patrons of temple architecture. The Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid is a particularly outstanding example of this continued tradition, showcasing exquisite craftsmanship and intricate detailing. Statement 3 is incorrect. While both the Hoysala and Chola styles share some similarities in temple construction, the Hoysalesvara Temple is considered a prime example of the Chalukyan style, not the Dravidian style. The Chalukyan style is characterized by its ornate sculptures and intricate detailing. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the historical, artistic, and cultural aspects of the Chola, Vijayanagara, and Bahmani periods.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style, prevalent during the Chola period, primarily featured single-storied structures with a central garbhagriha.
2. The Brihadisvara Temple at Tanjore, built by Rajaraja I, is a prime example of the Nagara style of temple architecture.
3.  Chola temples often included mandapas, pillared halls used for various activities including ceremonial dances performed by devadasis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Chola temples are renowned for their mandapas, elaborately carved pillared halls serving as audience halls and spaces for ceremonial dances by devadasis (women dedicated to temple service).  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Dravida style, prominent during the Chola period, is characterized by *multiple* storeys above the garbhagriha (innermost chamber), forming the vimana.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Brihadisvara Temple at Tanjore exemplifies the Dravida style, not the Nagara style which is associated with North India. The question plays on the potential confusion between architectural styles and the specific features of Chola temple construction.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's primary naval rival in the 14th century was the Sultanate of Delhi.
2.  The city of Vijayanagara, as described by contemporary travelers, was characterized by a highly organized urban layout based on caste and profession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is accurate. Accounts from foreign travelers highlight Vijayanagara's well-organized urban structure, with distinct quarters for different castes and professions, reflecting traditional Indian city planning. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Vijayanagara Empire's main naval rivals were primarily regional powers in South India, such as the Sultanate of Madurai, not the distant Sultanate of Delhi. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the Vijayanagara Empire had contact with these regions, the assertion of regular tribute payments is questionable and likely an exaggeration of diplomatic exchanges or occasional gifts rather than consistent tribute. The question tests knowledge of the empire's geographical reach and administrative structure, contrasting it with potential misconceptions about its naval power and the extent of its tributary system.


**3. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a significant decline in the influence of Hindu administrators within the Bahmani administration.
2. Mahmud Gawan, a prime minister of the Bahmani Kingdom, significantly expanded the kingdom's control over the western coastal areas, including Goa.
3. The Bahmani Kingdom's disintegration led directly to the immediate rise of the Mughal Empire in the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's tenure as prime minister saw considerable expansion of Bahmani territory, particularly along the western coast, including the crucial port of Goa.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Firuz Shah Bahmani, in contrast, is known for significantly *increasing* the involvement of Hindus, particularly Deccani Brahmins, in the administration. Statement 3 is incorrect; the disintegration of the Bahmani Kingdom resulted in the emergence of several independent Deccan sultanates (Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda, etc.), not the immediate rise of the Mughal Empire, which occurred much later. This question tests knowledge of key Bahmani rulers and their policies, distinguishing between factual accounts and potential chronological errors or misinterpretations of political succession.


**4. With reference to the religious and cultural developments in North India (circa 1000-1200), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Shiva, rejecting the Vedic traditions and emphasizing the equality of all castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  The Sufi movement is known to have incorporated certain yogic and ritualistic elements from existing Hindu practices. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Bhakti movement did emphasize the equality of all castes and devotional worship, it wasn't solely focused on Shiva;  it encompassed the worship of both Shiva and Vishnu.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Nath Panthi movement actually challenged the Brahmanical social hierarchy and Vedic rituals, aligning more with the Bhakti movement in its rejection of rigid caste distinctions. This question differentiates between the nuanced aspects of various religious movements, avoiding simplistic generalizations and testing the ability to distinguish between similar but distinct socio-religious reformations.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Chola temples were not merely religious centers but also significant economic players, receiving land grants and participating in various business ventures.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Chola economy was significantly boosted by its powerful navy and extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asia and other regions. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while Sanskrit was a language of high culture, the Cholas also greatly patronized Tamil literature, which flourished during this period.  The question contrasts the commonly known aspects of the Chola empire with potential misconceptions about its economic base and literary patronage.


**6. With reference to the architecture of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Alai Darwaza demonstrates a significant improvement in the scientific principles applied to dome construction during the Khalji period. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Qutab Minar was initially part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, not a Sufi shrine dedicated to Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Tughlaqs are known for using more readily available and less expensive greystone, while the Lodis, though also using greystone, sometimes incorporated features from other architectural styles. The question tests knowledge of specific architectural structures and styles, contrasting them with potential misconceptions about their original purpose and the materials used in their construction.  It also highlights the evolution of architectural techniques over time.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara-Bahmani conflicts, consider the following statements:**

1. The conflict between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani kingdom primarily centered on religious differences between Hinduism and Islam.
2. The battle of Bannihatti (Talikota) marked a decisive victory for the Bahmani kingdom, leading to the immediate collapse of the Vijayanagara Empire.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The Krishna-Godavari delta was a highly contested region due to its economic importance and strategic location. Statement 1 is incorrect; while religious differences existed, the conflicts were primarily driven by political and economic factors, such as control over fertile lands and trade routes. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the battle of Bannihatti was indeed a devastating defeat for Vijayanagara, but the empire continued to exist, albeit in a weakened state, for several more decades.  The question challenges the simplistic understanding of the conflicts, highlighting the complex interplay of political, economic, and strategic factors that shaped them.


**8. With reference to the Bhakti movement in North India during the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

Guru Nanak's teachings laid the groundwork for Sikhism, but his primary goal was not to establish a distinct religion, but rather to promote religious harmony. Statement 1 is incorrect; Ramananda is known for his inclusive approach, transcending caste barriers in his teachings and acceptance of disciples. This question tests the understanding of key figures and their ideologies within the Bhakti movement, highlighting their diverse approaches and the complexities of their social and religious impact.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text portrays Zain-ul-Abidin as a ruler who reversed the earlier policies of religious persecution, actively conciliating Hindus, restoring temples, and bringing back those who had fled.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text specifically mentions Zain-ul-Abidin's patronage of scholarship and his commissioning of translations of important Sanskrit works into Persian.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that Zain-ul-Abidin abolished the jizya tax and cow slaughter, demonstrating a policy of religious tolerance and respect for Hindu sentiments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2
(c) 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the Satnamis as a group that did *not* observe caste distinctions and included people from various backgrounds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While religious slogans might have been used, the Jat uprisings were deeply rooted in socio-economic grievances related to land revenue and zamindari rights.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text correctly identifies the Raushanai movement's emphasis on ethical life and devotion to a pir (spiritual guide) as part of the context of the Afghan uprisings.



**8. Consider the following statements about the economic condition of India between 800-1200 CE:**

1. Historians unanimously agree that this period witnessed a significant decline in both domestic and foreign trade.
2. The virtual absence of gold coins until the 10th century is considered definitive proof of economic stagnation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that there is debate among historians about the economic situation of this period, with some arguing for stagnation while others point to continued trade and economic activity.  A unanimous view is not supported by the passage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text notes that the absence of gold coins is used as *evidence* for stagnation but does not claim it to be *definitive proof*.  The lack of coinage does not necessarily equate to a complete absence of economic activity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text directly refutes this, stating that the Byzantine and Sassanid empires actively engaged in trade with India and the Indian Ocean region, thus mitigating the impact of the Roman Empire's fall.


**9. With reference to the literary developments during the period 1300-1500 CE, consider the following statements:**

1. The production of Sanskrit literature decreased significantly during this period due to the decline of Brahmanical influence.
2. Amir Khusrau, a prominent writer of the period, expressed a strong sense of attachment to India and its culture.
3.  Little to no attempt was made to translate Islamic works or Persian literature into Sanskrit during this period.

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that Sanskrit literature continued to be produced prolifically during this period, with works in various fields such as philosophy, poetry, drama, and law.  A significant decline is not supported.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text highlights Amir Khusrau's love for India and his pride in being an Indian, showcasing the integration of cultural identities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight tarafs, each under a tarafdar.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the significant internal strife within the Bahmani kingdom, particularly the conflicts between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afrans/gharibs).

Statement 3 is correct. The text highlights Mahmud Gawan's patronage of learning and describes his madrasa at Bidar as a grand institution that housed a large number of teachers and students, attracting scholars from various parts of the Islamic world.  While the exact number might be an exaggeration, the madrasa's scale and reputation are emphasized.


**1. With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Buland Darwaza, a half-dome portal, exemplifies the Mughal adoption of architectural elements from Iran.
2.  The use of pietra dura, a decorative technique involving semi-precious stones, was extensively employed by Shah Jahan in the Taj Mahal.
3. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram represents a pre-Mughal architectural style, marking the transition to a new Mughal style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mughal architecture.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is a prime example of Mughal architecture's incorporation of Iranian design elements, specifically the half-dome portal. This technique, borrowed from Iran, became a characteristic feature in subsequent Mughal buildings.  The statement correctly identifies this significant architectural detail and its origin.

The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan, showcases the exquisite pietra dura technique, where semi-precious stones are inlaid to create intricate floral designs.  This lavish decorative style was a hallmark of Shah Jahan's reign and significantly contributed to the aesthetic grandeur of Mughal architecture. The statement accurately highlights this specific decorative element and its association with Shah Jahan.

Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is indeed a remarkable example of pre-Mughal architecture, representing a culmination of earlier styles.  It's historically significant as a bridge between pre-Mughal and the emerging Mughal architectural styles, showcasing a transition in design and construction techniques. This statement correctly places the mausoleum within its historical architectural context.  Therefore, all three statements are factually correct.


**2. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal school of painting significantly influenced Pahari, Rajasthani, and Kangra painting styles.
2.  Under Jahangir's patronage, Mughal painting saw a peak in portraiture and animal painting, with Mansur being a prominent artist.
3.  Akbar's painting workshop incorporated both Hindu and Muslim artists, leading to a fusion of Indian and Persian styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of Mughal painting.  The Mughal style had a profound influence on regional schools like Pahari, Rajasthani, and Kangra, resulting in a distinctive blend of styles and techniques. This demonstrates the widespread impact of the Mughal artistic tradition across India.

Jahangir, known for his discerning eye, fostered the development of Mughal painting.  His reign witnessed a flourishing of portraiture and animal painting, with Mansur emerging as a master in depicting the natural world with remarkable detail and accuracy.  This statement correctly identifies a key development and prominent artist during Jahangir's reign.

Akbar's patronage of painting resulted in a unique artistic environment. His workshop brought together Hindu and Muslim artists, leading to a synthesis of Indian and Persian artistic traditions. This fusion of styles is evident in the themes, colors, and techniques employed in Mughal paintings. This statement rightly highlights the inclusive nature of Akbar's artistic patronage and its impact on the evolution of the Mughal style.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are all correct.


**3. With reference to the architecture of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Qutub Minar, begun by Aibak and completed by Iltutmish, was originally part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque.
2. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq's tomb is notable for its elevated platform and marble dome, representing a new architectural trend.
3.  The Tughlaq style, characterized by sloping walls ("batter"), is prominently featured in the buildings of Firuz Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of Delhi Sultanate architecture. The Qutub Minar, a towering structure, was indeed initially part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque complex, highlighting the integration of architectural elements in the early Delhi Sultanate.  The statement accurately describes the historical context and the initial purpose of the structure.

Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq's tomb does indeed feature a raised platform and a marble dome, innovative features for its time. This architectural style marked a shift in the design and construction of tombs within the Sultanate period.  The statement accurately depicts the architectural features and their significance.

However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the "batter" technique (sloping walls) was a characteristic of some Tughlaq architecture, it's not a prominent feature in the buildings of Firuz Tughlaq. Firuz Tughlaq's architecture, unlike his predecessors, showed a departure from this style.  This statement presents a misconception about Firuz Tughlaq's architectural preferences. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**4. With reference to the economic and social life during the period 800-1200 CE in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of the Roman Empire significantly impacted India's trade with the West during this period.
2. The expansion of agriculture during this period led to the growth of small towns catering to local trade.
3.  The virtual absence of gold coins before the 10th century suggests a period of economic stagnation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The expansion of agriculture, facilitated by irrigation improvements and land grants, did lead to the growth of smaller towns focused on local trade and commerce.  This reflects the localized economic development spurred by agricultural growth during this period.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the fall of the Roman Empire was a significant historical event, it did not seriously disrupt India's trade with the West, as other empires like the Byzantine and Sassanid took over the trade routes and maintained trade links with India.

Statement 3 is an oversimplification. The absence of widespread gold coinage before the 10th century is a complex issue and doesn't necessarily indicate overall economic stagnation.  Other forms of currency and trade existed, making it inaccurate to solely link the lack of gold coins to a period of decline.  Therefore, only statement 2 provides a completely accurate representation of the economic and social dynamics of the period.


**5. With reference to Akbar's reign and policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 established a system of checks and balances in provincial administration.
2. Akbar's Rajput policy primarily relied on matrimonial alliances as a precondition for establishing alliances.
3.  The abolition of jizya tax in 1564 demonstrated Akbar's policy of religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect Akbar's policies. Akbar's administrative reforms, including the division of the empire into twelve subas with a clear hierarchical structure and a system of checks and balances, aimed to improve governance and strengthen the empire.  This statement correctly identifies a key element of Akbar's administrative strategies.

Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax, a discriminatory tax levied on non-Muslims, was a significant step in promoting religious tolerance and fostering harmony within his diverse empire.  This statement correctly highlights a major policy decision reflecting Akbar's religious tolerance.

However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, it wasn't a strict precondition for establishing alliances.  His policy was more nuanced and flexible, encompassing both matrimonial relations and other forms of diplomatic engagement to secure alliances with Rajput states.  This statement presents an oversimplified view of Akbar's Rajput policy.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully accurate.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style, prevalent during the Chola period, primarily featured multi-storied vimanas above the garbhagriha, with the number of storeys ranging from five to seven.
2.  The Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, is a prime example of the Chalukyan style of architecture, characterized by intricate carvings and depictions of daily life.
3. Gopurams, the lofty gates of Chola temples, became increasingly elaborate over time, leading to the temples resembling miniature cities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of Chola temple architecture: the multi-storied vimana above the garbhagriha.  The Dravida style, indeed, flourished under the Cholas, and the description of the vimana's structure and number of storeys aligns with historical accounts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur is a magnificent example of Chola architecture, it's specifically attributed to the Dravida style, not the Chalukyan style. The Chalukyan style, though contemporaneous and influential, had distinct characteristics.  The description of intricate carvings and depictions of daily life is more broadly applicable to South Indian temple architecture of the period, but not uniquely defining of the Chalukyan style.

Statement 3 correctly highlights the evolution of gopurams in Chola temples.  Over time, these gateways grew taller and more ornate, contributing to the overall complexity and grandeur of the temple complexes, transforming them into sprawling structures resembling small cities.


**2. With reference to Chola-era cultural achievements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola period saw the zenith of bronze image-making, particularly evident in the Nataraja sculptures, which are considered masterpieces of South Indian art.
2. Kamban, a renowned poet believed to have lived at the court of a Chola king, authored the Ramayana, a classic in Tamil literature, reflecting the growth of vernacular literature during the period.
3. The Tirumurai, a collection of eleven volumes of writings by Saivite saints, was compiled during the Chola period and is considered the fifth Veda, showcasing the religious fervor of the era.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate reflections of Chola cultural achievements. Statement 1 correctly points to the high quality of Chola bronze casting, exemplified by the Nataraja sculptures, which are highly regarded in the world of art history. Statement 2 accurately identifies Kamban and his contribution to Tamil literature, his Ramayana being a cornerstone of Tamil classics.  The connection to the Chola court further strengthens its relevance to the period.  Statement 3 accurately describes the Tirumurai, its compilation, and its significance in Saivite tradition, reflecting the religious landscape of the Chola era.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions of South India (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. The absence of gold coins until the tenth century indicates a period of economic stagnation and decline in long-distance trade, contradicting evidence of flourishing foreign trade.
2. The Chola rulers expanded agriculture by constructing irrigation systems (bunds, wells, etc.), which strengthened the position of local chiefs and contributed to regional self-sufficiency.
3.  The fall of the Roman Empire significantly impacted India's trade with the West, leading to a decline in gold and silver imports, despite the rise of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 presents a debatable interpretation of the lack of gold coins. While the absence of widespread gold coinage is a fact, it doesn’t automatically equate to economic stagnation.  The text mentions continued trade with the West, suggesting that the lack of gold coinage might be due to other factors, such as preference for using gold in other forms (jewelry, temple decoration, etc.). The statement is therefore misleading.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Chola rulers' efforts in agricultural expansion.  The construction of irrigation infrastructure directly contributed to increased agricultural productivity and strengthened the position of local chiefs, leading to a degree of regional self-sufficiency. This aligns with the evidence of economic activity mentioned in the text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the fall of the Roman Empire did *not* severely impact India's trade with the West due to the rise of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, which actively engaged in trade with India.  The statement contradicts the information provided.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal, the ruler of Amber, was a crucial step in consolidating his alliance with the Rajputs, leading to the elevation of Bhara Mal and his family to high positions in the Mughal nobility.
2. Akbar's Rajput policy was exclusively based on matrimonial alliances; states like Ranthambhor, which did not enter into such alliances, remained outside the ambit of his influence.
3. The abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 and the policy of religious toleration were integral parts of Akbar's broader strategy of integrating the Rajputs into the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of Akbar's Rajput policy. The marriage alliance with the Amber ruler was strategically significant, leading to the elevation of Bhara Mal and his descendants within the Mughal administration.  This exemplifies Akbar's use of matrimonial alliances as a tool for political consolidation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy wasn't solely dependent on matrimonial alliances.  The text explicitly mentions that while marriages were a significant tool, he didn't insist upon them as a precondition for alliances. The example of the Hadas of Ranthambhor, who remained in Akbar's favour despite the absence of a matrimonial alliance, directly refutes this statement.

Statement 3 correctly highlights the crucial role of religious tolerance and the abolition of the jizya tax. These policies were instrumental in winning over the Rajput rulers and fostering a sense of inclusion within the Mughal empire, contributing to broader political stability.


**5. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, known as 'Friend of the Poor,' was deeply interested in music and composed the Kitab-i-Nawras, a book of songs set to various ragas, reflecting the flourishing of music in the Deccan.
2. Golconda was a significant centre for Urdu literature, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah being a notable poet who introduced secular themes into Urdu poetry, drawing inspiration from Persian, Hindi, and Telugu.
3. The Charminar in Hyderabad, built by Ibrahim Adil Shah II, is a prime example of Bijapuri architecture, showcasing the unique style of the Deccan with its four minarets and intricate carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of music and his contribution to the literary and musical landscape of Bijapur. The Kitab-i-Nawras exemplifies the Deccan's rich musical tradition.

Statement 2 correctly highlights Golconda's contribution to Urdu literature and Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's influence on the development of the language and its secular themes.  His poetry reflects the cultural synthesis in the Deccan.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Charminar was built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, not Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur. While both states had distinct architectural styles, attributing the Charminar to the wrong ruler is a significant factual error.  The description of the Charminar itself is accurate, but its association with the wrong ruler makes the entire statement factually incorrect.


**6. With reference to the Mughal architectural style, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram represents a culmination of pre-Mughal architectural styles and a starting point for the subsequent Mughal style.
2.  Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri complex showcases a blend of architectural styles, including those of Gujarat and Bengal, alongside Persian and Central Asian influences, reflecting Akbar’s eclectic taste.
3.  The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan, incorporated pietra dura inlay work extensively, a decorative technique primarily associated with Rajput architecture and not seen in Mughal architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately positions Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum as a transitional point in architectural history, bridging pre-Mughal and Mughal styles.  This is a well-established fact in art history.

Statement 2 correctly describes the architectural diversity of Fatehpur Sikri, highlighting the syncretic nature of Akbar's patronage. The fusion of regional Indian styles with external influences is a hallmark of Akbar's architectural vision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Pietra dura inlay work, while possibly having some historical connections to various regional styles, was extensively used in Mughal architecture under Jahangir and Shah Jahan, as evidenced by the Taj Mahal itself. The statement misrepresents the historical usage of this decorative technique.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and its challenges, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign were primarily peasant revolts against oppressive land revenue policies, often involving clashes with Rajput zamindars who held intermediary positions in the land revenue system.
2. The Afghan uprisings were tribal in nature, fuelled by economic hardships and a desire for regional autonomy, with religious revivalist movements like the Raushanai providing an ideological backdrop.
3. Aurangzeb's conflict with the Sikhs began with his direct confrontation with Guru Tegh Bahadur, leading to a major religious war that significantly weakened the Mughal empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the nature of Jat uprisings. These were largely peasant revolts triggered by land revenue issues, often entangled with the complexities of the zamindari system and the conflicting interests of Jat peasants and Rajput zamindars.

Statement 2 accurately portrays the Afghan uprisings as a complex mix of tribal conflicts, economic grievances, and aspirations for regional independence.  The Raushanai movement is correctly identified as a contributing factor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's conflict with the Sikhs did not begin with a major war against Guru Tegh Bahadur. While there were conflicts, it wasn't the initial trigger for widespread conflict. The statement exaggerates the immediate and large-scale nature of Aurangzeb's conflict with the Sikhs.  The conflicts were more gradual and evolved over time.


**1. With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of running water in Mughal palaces and pleasure resorts was a unique feature.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mughal architecture.  The incorporation of running water features in palaces and gardens was indeed a distinctive element of Mughal design, showcasing their engineering prowess and aesthetic preferences.  Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is widely considered a significant transitional structure, bridging the gap between pre-Mughal and Mughal architectural styles. Its innovative design and construction techniques marked a high point in the preceding architectural tradition and influenced subsequent Mughal works.  Finally, Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri complex is renowned for its eclectic blend of architectural styles.  The integration of elements from Gujarat and Bengal, alongside Persian influences, demonstrates Akbar's patronage of diverse artistic traditions and his ability to synthesize various styles into a unique imperial aesthetic. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one of these factually accurate statements.


**2. With reference to Mughal Gardens, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Jahangir's keen interest in art and his refined aesthetic sense significantly shaped the development of Mughal painting, leading to its peak during his reign.  The introduction of European painting techniques, particularly foreshortening, under Akbar's patronage represents a crucial aspect of the evolution of Mughal painting, demonstrating a synthesis of different artistic traditions. Statement 1 is incorrect; Mughal painting, while highly influential, did not entirely supplant pre-existing Indian painting traditions. Instead, it engaged in a dynamic interplay with these styles, resulting in a unique hybrid form.  Options (a), (c), and (d) erroneously include the inaccurate statement 1.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative reforms.  The jharoka darshan, a daily public appearance, was a crucial element of Akbar's image-building and accessibility to the populace.  It allowed for direct interaction and the submission of petitions. The open darbar further facilitated the redressal of grievances and public administration.  The evolution of the Ghusal Khana into a private chamber for ministerial consultations highlights the careful division of Akbar's time between public duties and confidential policy discussions. The division of the empire into twelve subas with a defined hierarchy of officials represented a significant administrative restructuring aimed at decentralization with built-in checks and balances to prevent abuse of power.  This system ensured efficient governance across the vast empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. While Akbar did marry Harkha Bai to strengthen his alliance with Amber, the statement misrepresents the complexity of his relationship with his Rajput wives and their families.  His Rajput policy was multifaceted, involving both matrimonial alliances and other strategies to integrate Rajput elites into the Mughal system.  The assertion that his policy *exclusively* relied on marriage is false.  Statement 3 correctly emphasizes Akbar's policy of religious tolerance towards his Hindu wives and the significant elevation of their families, such as Bhara Mal's, to prominent positions within the Mughal court and administration. This shows his pragmatic approach to integrating powerful Hindu groups into his empire.



**3. With reference to the Mughal-Deccan relations during Shah Jahan's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's Deccan policy primarily focused on subduing Bijapur, offering Ahmadnagar's territories as concessions to secure alliances.
2. The treaties of 1636 with Bijapur and Golconda established Mughal suzerainty across India, while simultaneously allowing the Deccan states to expand southward.
3. Shah Jahan's policy towards the Deccan involved only military pressure, disregarding any diplomatic efforts or concessions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Shah Jahan's Deccan policy.  His strategy indeed focused on Bijapur as the key to controlling the Deccan, offering territorial concessions from Ahmadnagar to achieve this goal. The treaties of 1636 were a significant diplomatic achievement, establishing nominal Mughal suzerainty over the Deccan states.  Simultaneously, these treaties allowed Bijapur and Golconda to expand their territories southwards, a policy that ultimately destabilized the region. Statement 3 is incorrect as Shah Jahan's approach was a blend of military pressure and diplomatic maneuvering, utilizing a combination of "stick and carrot" strategies to achieve his objectives.


**4. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of music and the arts is reflected in his book, *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas.

3. Golconda was exclusively a center for Islamic scholarship and learning, with no significant patronage of Hindu scholars or traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly highlight the cultural contributions of the Deccan states. Ibrahim Adil Shah II's *Kitizb-i-Nawras* showcases his patronage of music and his interest in the integration of Hindu and Muslim cultural elements, as he freely invoked Saraswati, the goddess of music and learning, in his compositions. The Charminar, built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, is a prominent example of Deccan architecture, though it primarily reflects the Deccani style, and not a direct blend of Mughal and Persian styles, as the statement suggests.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Golconda, while having a strong Islamic influence, also witnessed significant patronage of Hindu scholars and traditions, reflecting the religious tolerance prevalent in the Deccan.

3.  Akbar's administrative reforms included the establishment of a centralized system of record-keeping and revenue collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Akbar's revenue system was not based solely on the Zabt system; it employed a combination of methods adapted to different regions. The Mansabdari system, while primarily military, had broader administrative and social implications, impacting the hierarchy and organization of the Mughal state. Statement 3 accurately describes a key aspect of Akbar's administrative reforms, which involved establishing a centralized system for record-keeping and revenue collection to improve efficiency and control. This involved standardizing procedures and creating a more efficient bureaucracy across his vast empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is indeed a landmark of architecture, representing a transitional phase between pre-Mughal and early Mughal styles.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Sher Shah Suri did not abolish the Jizya tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. While the use of running water was a significant feature of Mughal gardens and palaces, its introduction predates Shah Jahan.  Although pietra dura was used extensively during Jahangir's reign, its peak development occurred under Shah Jahan.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the Taj Mahal as a pinnacle of Mughal architecture, bringing together and refining elements from earlier periods. It is considered a masterpiece that synthesizes various architectural and decorative styles, representing the culmination of Mughal architectural achievements.


**8. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mughal painting initially drew heavily on Persian styles, gradually incorporating Indian themes and techniques.
2. The practice of having different artists paint different parts of a single painting was a unique feature of the Rajput school of painting.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. Mughal painting did initially borrow heavily from Persian styles, but it evolved, integrating Indian themes, colors, and techniques to create a unique style.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the practice of different artists working on different parts of a single painting was a feature of the *Mughal* school, not the Rajput school.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; Aurangzeb's disinterest in painting led to the dispersal of artists and the development of distinct regional schools, such as the ones in Rajasthan and the Punjab Hills.


**9. With reference to the socio-religious policies of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the Jizya tax was primarily motivated by economic considerations, rather than religious zealotry.
2. Aurangzeb's religious policies were characterized by strict adherence to orthodox Islamic principles, leading to conflicts with non-Muslim populations.
3. Aurangzeb's policies towards Hindus were consistently intolerant and discriminatory, without any instances of accommodation or compromise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the Jizya tax had economic implications, it was largely driven by his religious ideology and the desire to consolidate his image as an orthodox Muslim ruler.  His policies were indeed characterized by a strict adherence to orthodox Islamic principles, sometimes leading to conflicts with non-Muslim subjects. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's policies often leaned towards intolerance, there were instances where he showed flexibility or accommodation, depending on political expediency and specific circumstances.  His policies were complex and cannot be characterized as consistently and uniformly intolerant.

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily peasant revolts against oppressive revenue policies, with little religious motivation.
2. The Sikh movement, during Aurangzeb's reign, was characterized by armed resistance against Mughal authority.
3.  The Jat and Sikh movements were entirely isolated from each other, with no interaction or influence between them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are largely correct. The Jat uprisings were indeed rooted in peasant grievances and resistance against harsh revenue policies, although religious factors also played a role in mobilizing support. The Sikh movement under Guru Tegh Bahadur did mark a shift towards armed resistance against Mughal authority. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Jat and Sikh movements had different origins and characteristics, they were not entirely isolated.  The political instability caused by Mughal conflicts with the Jats and other groups created opportunities for the Sikh movement to gain ground.  The movements operated within the same broader context of resistance against the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

The statements present factual information without distortion or misleading elements.


**3. With reference to the consolidation of the Mughal Empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate representations of Akbar's policies and the conflict with Mewar. Statement 1 correctly highlights Akbar's strategic use of matrimonial alliances, religious tolerance towards his Hindu wives, and the elevation of Rajput families, exemplified by his relationship with the Kachhwahas. Statement 2 accurately describes the Battle of Haldighati and its significance in the context of Akbar's Rajput policy, though Mewar did not fully submit under Akbar's lifetime.  However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Akbar abolished the jizya tax, he did *not* grant complete non-interference in the internal affairs of conquered Rajput states.  He exerted considerable influence and control over their administrations.  This makes option (c) the most accurate choice.


**4. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately depict aspects of Sher Shah Suri's reign. Statement 1 correctly describes the architectural significance of his mausoleum at Sasaram and his mosque in the Old Fort of Delhi.  Statement 3 correctly points out the lack of widespread religious tolerance under his rule, with the jizya tax continuing and his nobility largely composed of Afghans. However, statement 2 is partially inaccurate. While Sher Shah Suri did implement land revenue reforms, his system, though efficient, was not a direct foundation for the *entire* Mughal administrative structure.  The Mughals, particularly Akbar, introduced significant modifications and improvements to the revenue system. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  Statement 1 correctly describes Alauddin Khalji's economic policies, which aimed to control prices and ensure fair distribution of essential commodities.  This was a significant aspect of his administration, though its long-term impact is debated. Statement 2 accurately explains Muhammad bin Tughlaq's token currency experiment. Although ultimately unsuccessful due to various factors, it demonstrated his forward-thinking approach to monetary policy and his attempt to address economic challenges.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The division of the empire into twelve subas was a feature of Akbar's reign within the Mughal empire, not the Delhi Sultanate.  The Delhi Sultanate had different administrative structures.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**6. With reference to the cultural interactions and developments during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bengali language experienced significant growth during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519), who patronized Bengali literature and promoted cultural harmony.
2. The Gajapati rulers of Orissa were known for their patronage of art and architecture, as evidenced by the construction of the famous Puri temple and the Konark Sun Temple.
3. Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat, despite his acts of religious intolerance, also employed Hindus in his administration, indicating a complex relationship between religious policy and governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect various facets of cultural interactions and developments during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly points to the flourishing of Bengali literature and language under Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign, who adopted a policy of religious tolerance and employed Hindus in his administration, fostering a conducive environment for cultural growth. Statement 2 accurately attributes the construction of significant temples (Puri and Konark) to the Gajapati rulers of Orissa, showcasing their patronage of architecture and artistic development. Statement 3 correctly describes the complex religious policies of Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat. While he displayed religious intolerance in certain actions, his employment of Hindus in key administrative positions reveals a nuanced approach to governance, where political expediency sometimes superseded strict religious adherence. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**7. With reference to the Chola Empire and its cultural achievements, consider the following statements:**

1. Chola temple architecture, characterized by the Dravida style with multi-storied vimanas, mandapas, and elaborate gopurams, reached its zenith under Rajaraja I.
2. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, also known as the Rajaraja Temple, exemplifies the Dravida style and is considered a masterpiece of Chola architecture.

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the cultural achievements of the Chola Empire. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Dravida style as the defining characteristic of Chola temple architecture, detailing its key features (vimanas, mandapas, gopurams). It further accurately points out that this style reached its peak under the rule of Rajaraja I. Statement 2 correctly identifies the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur as a prime example of Dravida architecture and notes its significance as a testament to Chola architectural prowess.  Statement 3 accurately highlights the excellence of Chola bronze sculptures, particularly the Nataraja images, which are prized for their artistic merit and technical skill, representing a high point of Chola artistry.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**8. With reference to the political and military developments of the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's seventeen raids into India, primarily targeting wealthy temples and towns, were driven by a combination of religious zeal and the desire for plunder, significantly impacting the political landscape of North India.
2. The Ghaznavids’ rise to power in the late 9th and 10th centuries was facilitated by the Ghazi spirit, a blend of religious fervor and military ambition that enabled them to expand their influence across West Asia and Central Asia.
3. The Hindushahi rulers of the Punjab, despite facing formidable challenges from Mahmud of Ghazni, managed to maintain their independence for a considerable period, demonstrating resilience in the face of external threats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Statement 1 accurately describes Mahmud of Ghazni's campaigns in India, highlighting the motivations behind his raids and their impact on the political stability of North India.  His actions significantly disrupted the existing power structures. Statement 2 accurately explains the role of the "Ghazi" spirit in the Ghaznavids' rise. This combination of religious zeal and military ambition fueled their expansion and conquest. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Hindushahi kingdom ultimately fell to Mahmud of Ghazni after a prolonged struggle, not maintaining independence for a significant period after his initial incursions. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about the later Lodi dynasty and their impact on the political and cultural landscape:**

1. Sikandar Lodi's selection of Agra as a strategic location for a new city in 1506 reflected his ambition to control eastern Rajasthan and the routes leading to Malwa and Gujarat.
2. Sikandar Lodi's reign witnessed a significant degree of cultural rapprochement between Hindus and Muslims, marked by the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and the recruitment of Hindus into administrative posts.
3. Ibrahim Lodi's unsuccessful campaign against Mewar highlighted the persistent challenges faced by the Delhi Sultanate in maintaining control over Rajput states and managing the complex political dynamics of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Lodi dynasty's reign. Statement 1 correctly identifies the strategic significance of Agra's selection as a new city by Sikandar Lodi. The location was crucial for controlling key trade routes and expanding influence. Statement 2 accurately describes the cultural policies of Sikandar Lodi's reign, emphasizing the promotion of cultural exchange and the integration of Hindus into the administration.  Statement 3 correctly points out Ibrahim Lodi's unsuccessful campaign against Mewar, demonstrating the ongoing challenges in controlling Rajput territories and highlighting the inherent instability of the Delhi Sultanate's control over the region. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style, prevalent during the Chola period, primarily featured multi-storied vimanas above the garbhagriha, ranging from five to seven stories.
2.  Chola temples typically included a pillared mandap, functioning as an audience hall and a venue for ceremonial dances performed by devadasis, and often incorporated a circumambulatory passage around the sanctum.
3. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, exemplifies the early phase of the Dravida style, showcasing a single courtyard and modest gopurams.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of Chola Dravida temple architecture: the multi-storied vimana above the garbhagriha.  The text explicitly mentions the vimana's multiple stories (five to seven) and its location atop the sanctum. This architectural feature is a defining element of the Dravida style.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the typical inclusion of a pillared mandap, serving as both an audience hall and a space for ceremonial dances by devadasis. The text clearly explains this dual function of the mandap. The circumambulatory passage around the sanctum is also mentioned as a common feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur is indeed a magnificent example of Chola architecture, the text states it represents a *fine* example of the Dravida style, not an *early* one. Furthermore, the description indicates that the temple's design became more elaborate over time, with the addition of multiple courtyards and increasingly ornate gopurams.  The statement misrepresents the temple's place within the evolution of Chola architectural style.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the cultural landscape of South India during the Chola period (8th-12th centuries CE), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola capital, Gangaikondacholapuram, remains a significant urban center today, showcasing well-preserved palaces and royal residences.
2.  The art of bronze sculpture flourished, with Nataraja figures being particularly renowned as masterpieces, many of which are found in museums globally.
3.  Tamil literature experienced a golden age during the reign of Rajaraja I, marked by the composition of Kamban's Ramayana, a classic still celebrated in Tamil Nadu.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that Gangaikondacholapuram, the Chola capital, is now a small village near Thanjavur, and that none of the palaces from that period have survived. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of a significant urban center with preserved palaces.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the high standard of sculpture during this period, specifically mentioning the Nataraja figures in bronze as masterpieces, many of which are found in museums worldwide. This aligns perfectly with the statement.

Statement 3 is also correct. The text describes the reign of Kamban, placing him in the second half of the 11th and early 12th centuries, and identifies his Ramayana as a classic of Tamil literature.  This supports the statement's claim of a golden age in Tamil literature during this period, although it doesn't specifically tie it to Rajaraja I's reign directly.  The connection is implied through the overall context of the Chola period.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**3. With reference to the socio-economic conditions of South India during the Chola period (8th-12th centuries CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  Chola temples solely relied on royal patronage for their financial sustenance, receiving no income from other sources.
2.  The Chola economy experienced a significant decline in trade and commerce, leading to the virtual absence of gold coins until the 10th century.
3.  South Indian agriculture flourished during the Chola period, aided by the rulers' investments in irrigation infrastructure such as tanks and canals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Chola temples received revenue-free land grants and donations from wealthy merchants, and some even engaged in business and lending activities. This demonstrates that their financial support extended beyond royal patronage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions a debate among historians regarding the economic situation, with some suggesting stagnation or decline. However, it also counters this view by pointing out that trade with the West continued through the Byzantine and Sassanid empires and later with the Arab empire.  The absence of gold coins until the 10th century is presented as evidence of potential decline, but this is not conclusive and is contested within the text itself.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly describes the Chola rulers' investment in improving agriculture through the construction of bunds, wells, and irrigation channels. This directly supports the statement's assertion of agricultural prosperity.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**4. With reference to the Chalukyan and Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kailasanatha Temple at Kanchipuram and the Shore Temple at Mamallapuram are both prime examples of the Chalukyan architectural style.
2. The Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid is renowned for its intricate sculptures depicting scenes of daily life, including dance, music, war, and love, seamlessly integrating religion and societal activities.
3. The Chalukyan style is characterized by structures carved entirely from solid rock, mirroring the architectural techniques employed in the Kailasanatha Temple at Kanchipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the Kailasanatha Temple at Kanchipuram is an example of the *Dravida* style, not the Chalukyan style. The Shore Temple at Mamallapuram is also not explicitly mentioned in relation to the Chalukyan style.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly describes the Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid, highlighting its elaborate sculptures depicting a wide range of scenes from daily life, showcasing a close integration of religion and social life.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text mentions rock-cut architecture, it doesn't associate this solely with the Chalukyan style or the Kailasanatha Temple at Kanchipuram. The Kailasanatha temple is noted as an early example of the Dravida style which is different from Chalukyan style.


**5.  With reference to the literary and cultural developments in South India during the period 800-1200 CE, consider the following statements:**

1. Sanskrit remained the dominant literary language, with minimal development or use of regional languages like Tamil and Kannada.
2. The Alvars and Nayanmars, popular saints devoted to Vishnu and Shiva respectively, composed their works primarily in Sanskrit, contributing significantly to the religious literature of the period.
3. The growth of literature in local languages like Tamil and Kannada is a notable feature of this period, with significant contributions from both religious and secular writers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly highlights the growth of literature in regional languages like Tamil and Kannada during this period, contrasting it with the continued use of Sanskrit. The statement misrepresents the linguistic landscape of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the Alvars and Nayanmars composed their works in Tamil, not Sanskrit.  The statement misattributes the language of their literary contributions.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text directly supports this statement, detailing the flourishing of Tamil and Kannada literature, mentioning specific authors and works, and emphasizing the contribution of both religious and secular writers.  This accurately reflects the literary developments of the period.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced Persian literary works produced in the Mughal court.
2.  The Mahabharata's translation into Persian was overseen by Faizi, Abul Fazl's brother.
3.  Hindu scholars played a minimal role in the development of Persian literature during the Mughal period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Abul Fazl, a prominent scholar and historian of Akbar's court, established a prose writing style that was widely imitated for generations, significantly impacting the Persian literary landscape of the Mughal era. His influence extended to both the style and content of various literary works.

Statement 2 is also correct. Faizi, Abul Fazl's brother and a leading poet of the time, played a crucial role in Akbar's translation department. He directly oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian, a significant undertaking that facilitated cross-cultural exchange and understanding.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that Hindus contributed to the growth of Persian literature during this period. While the extent of their contribution might be debated, their involvement was undeniable, contrary to the statement's assertion.  Many Hindu scholars worked in Akbar's translation department, contributing to the rich tapestry of Persian literature during the Mughal era.  This highlights the complex interplay of cultural exchange and syncretism during this period.


**2. With reference to the development of regional languages in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to the maturity and standardization of several regional languages.
2.  The use of regional languages for administrative purposes predated the arrival of the Turks.
3.  The Mughal emperors actively suppressed the use of regional languages in favour of Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement played a pivotal role in the development of regional languages.  The saints' use of vernacular languages to communicate their devotional messages to a wider audience, irrespective of caste or creed, significantly boosted the prestige and literary development of these languages.  This increased usage led to the standardization of grammar, vocabulary, and literary forms.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text indicates that regional languages like Tamil, Kannada, and Marathi were used for administrative purposes in pre-Turkish India, showing that the usage of regional languages in administration was not a post-Mughal phenomenon.  This pre-existing administrative use laid the foundation for their further development.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mughal emperors, particularly Akbar, while promoting Persian as the court language, did not actively suppress regional languages.  In fact, several regional languages flourished under their patronage, with translations of religious texts and encouragement of local poets. The coexistence of Persian and regional languages demonstrates a complex linguistic landscape rather than outright suppression.


**3. With reference to the religious and social movements of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh movement's early development was primarily characterized by quiet meditation and scholarship.
2.  Guru Arjun's aristocratic lifestyle and collection of offerings were major factors in the conflict with Mughal authorities.
3.  The conflicts between the Sikh Gurus and Mughal rulers were primarily rooted in religious differences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The first four Sikh Gurus emphasized quiet meditation and scholarship, establishing a foundation of spiritual and intellectual pursuits before the movement's later expansion and increased political involvement.  This initial focus on internal spiritual growth contrasts sharply with the later more outward-facing aspects of the movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Guru Arjun's adoption of an aristocratic lifestyle, construction of prominent buildings at Amritsar, and institution of a system of collecting offerings from Sikhs contributed to tensions with the Mughal authorities.  These actions, while aimed at strengthening the Sikh movement, were perceived by the Mughals as a challenge to their authority and potentially destabilizing the existing power structures,  leading to conflict.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text argues that the conflicts between Sikh Gurus and Mughal rulers stemmed from personal, political, and circumstantial factors rather than primarily religious differences.  While religious elements might have played a minor role, the conflicts were more complex and multifaceted than simply religious persecution.  The text highlights the coexistence and interaction between Sufi saints and Mughal rulers, suggesting a broader context than a simple religious conflict narrative.



**4. With reference to the musical traditions of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's patronage of Tansen significantly influenced the development of new musical melodies (ragas).
2.  Aurangzeb's reign saw a complete suppression of all forms of musical expression in the Mughal court.
3.  The largest number of books on classical Indian music in Persian were written during Aurangzeb's reign.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's patronage of Tansen, a renowned musician from Gwalior, led to the composition of numerous new ragas and a significant flourishing of musical traditions within the Mughal court. Tansen's influence extended beyond Akbar's reign, shaping the development of Indian classical music.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb is often portrayed as suppressing music, the text clarifies that he banned singing in his court but not the playing of instruments. In fact, Aurangzeb himself was a skilled veena player, and music continued to be patronized by his queens and other members of the court.  This nuanced understanding contradicts the assertion of complete suppression.

Statement 3 is correct. The text states that the largest number of books on classical Indian music written in Persian were produced during Aurangzeb's reign, despite the restrictions on singing in the court.  This suggests continued interest and scholarship in music theory and documentation, even amidst the restrictions on musical performance.  This paradox highlights the complex relationship between patronage, practice, and documentation in the cultural sphere.


**5. With reference to the political and military aspects of the early Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's victory at Panipat marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India.
2.  The battle of Khanwa decisively secured Babur's position in the Delhi-Agra region.
3.  Babur's military strategies relied solely on cavalry tactics, neglecting the use of artillery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's victory at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 against Ibrahim Lodi, the last Sultan of Delhi, is widely considered the pivotal event that marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India. This victory established a foothold for the Mughals in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Khanwa (1527) against Rana Sanga, a powerful Rajput ruler, solidified Babur's control over the Delhi-Agra region.  This victory eliminated a major obstacle to the consolidation of Mughal power in the area.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Babur's military strategies were innovative and combined the use of cavalry with artillery effectively.  This combined approach was a key factor in his victories. His strategic use of artillery and flanking maneuvers proved decisive in battles like Panipat and Khanwa, demonstrating a sophisticated military approach.  The statement's claim of sole reliance on cavalry is thus inaccurate.


**6.  With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is considered a masterpiece of medieval architecture.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's administration was characterized by religious bigotry and persecution of Hindus.
3.  The Padmavat, a significant Hindi work, was completed during Sher Shah Suri's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is indeed renowned as a magnificent example of medieval architecture, showcasing a unique blend of architectural styles and representing a high point of architectural achievement during his reign.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sher Shah Suri's administration, while not entirely without instances of religious discrimination, was not characterized by widespread religious bigotry or persecution of Hindus. The text indicates that he did not rely on religious divines for his decisions. While the collection of jizya continued, his overall policy was more pragmatic than religiously motivated.

Statement 3 is correct. The Padmavat, a notable Hindi literary work by Malik Muhammad Jaisi, was completed during Sher Shah Suri's reign, reflecting the literary and cultural developments of that period.  This demonstrates a broader patronage of the arts and letters, irrespective of religious considerations.


**7. With reference to the early life and reign of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's birth took place in Amarkot, during Humayun's retreat from Bikaner.
2.  Bairam Khan's rebellion immediately followed Akbar's accession to the throne.
3.  Akbar's early reign was marked by a series of conflicts with powerful noble factions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar was indeed born in Amarkot, during Humayun's retreat from Bikaner, highlighting the precarious political situation at the time of his birth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bairam Khan's rebellion did occur during Akbar's reign, it did not immediately follow his accession.  There was a period where Bairam Khan acted as regent and consolidated Akbar's power before the rebellion occurred.  The timing of the rebellion is crucial and the statement misrepresents the sequence of events.

Statement 3 is correct.  Akbar's early reign was significantly marked by conflicts with powerful noble factions, such as the Uzbeks and the Mirzas, who challenged his authority and triggered various rebellions.  These conflicts highlight the power struggles and consolidation of power that characterized the early years of his rule.  Akbar's ability to overcome these challenges was essential to his subsequent success in building a strong empire.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material and the requirement for difficult, non-obvious questions, some questions may have more complex explanations than others.  The difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, exemplifies the Dravida style, characterized by multiple storeys above the garbhagriha.
2. Chola temples typically included a pillared mandap, used as an audience hall and for ceremonial dances performed by devadasis.
3. The gopurams, lofty gates enclosing the temple courtyard, became increasingly elaborate over time, transforming the temple into a miniature city.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key features of Chola temple architecture. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur is a prime example of the Dravida style's characteristic multi-storied vimana above the sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha). The mandap, a pillared hall, served multiple functions, including as an audience hall and a space for devadasis' performances. The gopurams, the monumental gateways, evolved in complexity and size, creating a layered and expansive temple complex resembling a small city.  The other options fail to capture the complete picture of Chola temple architecture's intricate design and evolution.


**2. With reference to the socio-economic aspects of South India (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola capital, Gangaikondacholapuram, remained a major urban center even after the decline of the Chola Empire.
2.  The absence of gold coins before the 10th century indicates a period of economic stagnation and decline in South India.
3.  Chola temples often received revenue-free land grants and engaged in business activities, lending money and participating in commercial ventures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  Gangaikondacholapuram is now a small village, contradicting statement 1. While the lack of gold coins before the 10th century is noted,  it's an oversimplification to equate this to overall economic stagnation; other forms of exchange and economic activity existed. Statement 3 correctly points out the significant role of Chola temples in the economy, receiving land grants and actively participating in trade and finance, demonstrating their economic power and influence.


**3. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of South India (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. Kamban's Ramayana, a classic of Tamil literature, is believed to have been written at the court of a Vijayanagara king.
2. The Tirumurai, a collection of Saivite saint's works, is considered sacred and is regarded as the fifth Veda.
3.  The Chalukya and Hoysala rulers primarily patronized Telugu literature, while Kannada literature received less attention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The Tirumurai is indeed a revered collection of Saivite works considered sacred, akin to a fifth Veda.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Kamban's Ramayana is associated with the Chola period, not the Vijayanagara. Statement 3 is also incorrect as both Chalukya and Hoysala rulers patronized Kannada literature significantly, along with Telugu.


**4. With reference to the cultural interactions during the medieval period in India (1300-1500 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. Amir Khusrau's writings indicate that regional languages were not widely used for common purposes of life before the 14th century.
2. The Bhakti movement contributed significantly to the development and use of regional languages in literature.
3. The Delhi Sultanate primarily used Persian for administrative purposes, with little use of regional languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is accurate. Amir Khusrau's writings actually show the opposite of statement 1, indicating the long-standing use of regional languages. Statement 3 is incorrect because, while Persian was important, regional languages were also used in administration, especially in later periods and regional kingdoms.  The Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages for religious expression played a crucial role in their development and literary use, supporting statement 2.


**5. With reference to the Mughal era (16th-17th centuries), consider the following statements:**

1. Abul Fazl's prose style was greatly influenced by the writings of his brother, Faizi, who also oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  During the Mughal period, Sanskrit scholarship primarily flourished in North India under direct imperial patronage.
3. The works of Tulsidas, a significant Hindi poet, focused primarily on the glorification of Krishna and the themes of the Bhagavata Purana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is fully correct. While Abul Fazl's prose style was indeed influential, it's an overstatement to say it was *greatly* influenced by Faizi, and Faizi's role in the Mahabharata translation is accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect because Sanskrit scholarship continued to thrive in South and East India, not primarily in the North under direct Mughal patronage. Statement 3 is wrong as Tulsidas's work, the Ramcharitmanas, centers on Rama, not Krishna.


**6.  With reference to the socio-religious movements of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nath Panthis, followers of Gorakhnath, primarily belonged to the upper castes and strongly upheld the existing caste system.
2.  The Bhakti movement in South India, led by saints like the Alvars and Nayanmars, completely rejected the caste system and actively worked towards its dismantling.
3.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, included disciples from all castes, challenging traditional caste hierarchies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. The Nath Panthis, contrary to statement 1, included members from lower castes and challenged Brahmanical authority. The Bhakti movement, while promoting inclusivity, didn't entirely dismantle the caste system (statement 2). Ramananda's acceptance of disciples from all castes, including lower castes, is a well-documented aspect of his teachings, thus making statement 3 true.


**7. With reference to the early medieval period in North India (circa 1000-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. While Mahmud of Ghazni's raids had religious overtones, the primary motivation was plunder and wealth acquisition.  The Shahis received limited support from Rajput rulers, not significant military aid. Mahmud's raids, as described in the text, focused on the wealth of temples and towns, which also helped fund his Central Asian conflicts.


**8. With reference to the Ghurid conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The First Battle of Tarain resulted in a decisive victory for Mu'izzuddin Muhammad Ghori, leading to the immediate establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The First Battle of Tarain was a Ghurid defeat, not a victory (statement 1). Prithviraj Chauhan did *not* have Jaichandra's support, as Jaichandra remained neutral (statement 2). The Second Battle of Tarain is widely recognized as a watershed moment, leading to the establishment of Turkish dominance in North India.


**9. With reference to the later medieval period in Bengal (15th-16th centuries), consider the following statements:**

1. The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah marked a period of decline for the Bengali language and literature.
2. Alauddin Hussain Shah's administration included several high-ranking Hindu officials, reflecting a policy of religious tolerance.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is known for its relative religious tolerance, evidenced by the appointment of Hindu officials.  His conquest of Kamata did expand Bengal's territory eastward. Statement 1 is incorrect; his reign was a significant period for the growth of Bengali language and literature.


**10. With reference to the Bhakti movement in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Namadeva's poetry, written in Hindi, emphasized the importance of following strict Vedic rituals for salvation.
2.  Kabir's teachings strongly denounced idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices, emphasizing a direct path to God.
3.  Guru Nanak's travels were largely confined to the Punjab region, with limited influence beyond that area.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Namadeva's poetry was in Marathi, not Hindi, and didn't emphasize Vedic rituals (statement 1). Kabir's rejection of traditional practices and emphasis on a direct path to God are well-known aspects of his teachings. Guru Nanak's travels extended far beyond the Punjab (statement 3).

1. The Dravida style, prevalent during the Chola period, primarily featured multi-storied vimanas above the garbhagriha, with the number of storeys ranging from five to seven.
2.  The Brihadiswara temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, exemplifies the Dravida style, and is also known as the Rajaraja temple due to the Chola practice of installing royal images within temple courtyards.
3. The Kailasanathar temple at Kanchipuram, dating back to the 8th century, represents an early example of the Chalukya style of temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of Chola Dravida architecture: the multi-storied vimana rising above the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). The number of storeys varied, typically between five and seven, creating a distinctive vertical emphasis.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the Brihadiswara temple at Thanjavur as a prime example of Chola Dravida architecture.  The text explicitly mentions this temple and its association with Rajaraja I, further noting the Chola custom of including royal imagery within temple complexes. This reinforces the statement's accuracy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Kailasanathar temple at Kanchipuram is indeed an early example of a Dravida-style temple,  it's wrongly attributed to the Chalukya style in the statement. The text clearly states that Kailasanathar temple at Kanchipuram is an early example of the Dravida style.  This highlights the importance of precise attribution in historical architectural analysis, a crucial aspect for UPSC aspirants.  Confusing architectural styles demonstrates a lack of detailed knowledge, a common pitfall in UPSC examinations.

Statement 3 correctly highlights the characteristics of Tughlaq architecture, including the use of "batter" (sloping walls), the combination of arch and lintel-beam principles, and the relatively plain aesthetic resulting from the use of greystone. The statement shows an understanding of architectural styles and their underlying reasons.  The inclusion of "batter" as a distinctive feature demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of the architectural style than simply mentioning the use of domes or arches.


**4. With reference to the socio-religious movements of 800-1200 CE in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement in South India, led by Nayanmars and Alvars, emphasized a personal, loving bond with God (Siva and Vishnu), rejecting austerities and using easily understood Tamil, thereby making it accessible to all castes.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately portray significant socio-religious movements of the period. Statement 1 correctly describes the Bhakti movement's core tenets: a focus on personal devotion, rejection of harsh austerities, and the use of vernacular language to reach a broader audience, including lower castes. The mention of Tamil as the language of communication is key, showing detailed knowledge of the movement's regional context.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Lingayat movement, emphasizing its opposition to the caste system and its promotion of social reforms.  The specific mention of opposing child marriage and allowing widow remarriage demonstrates a deep understanding of the movement's social impact.

Statement 3 accurately outlines Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy and its impact. The statement correctly points out the philosophical challenge to Buddhism and Jainism and the synthesis of Jnana and Bhakti as paths to salvation. The mention of "Advaita Vedanta" showcases precise terminology, essential for UPSC-level responses.  The juxtaposition of Jnana and Bhakti highlights a sophisticated understanding of the philosophy's nuanced approach.

2. The Ghurid Sultanate, under Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad Ghuri, decisively defeated Prithviraj Chauhan at the Second Battle of Tarain (1192 CE), marking a turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
3. The Battle of Chandawar (1194 CE), where Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad Ghuri defeated Jaichandra, the Gahadavala ruler of Kannauj, solidified Turkish control over the Gangetic plains and paved the way for further expansion into Bihar and Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements provide accurate accounts of significant events in the early Turkish conquests. Statement 1 correctly describes the nature of Mahmud of Ghazni's campaigns—predatory raids focused on plunder rather than sustained territorial control, primarily confined to the Punjab and beyond.  The emphasis on the lack of lasting political control is crucial, demonstrating an understanding of the limitations of Ghaznavid power in India.

Statement 2 accurately identifies the Second Battle of Tarain as a pivotal moment, correctly mentioning the victor (Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad Ghuri) and the vanquished (Prithviraj Chauhan). The statement correctly links this victory to the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, indicating a strong understanding of historical causality.

Statement 3 accurately describes the Battle of Chandawar and its consequences, correctly specifying the combatants and the resulting expansion of Turkish influence into the Gangetic plains and beyond. The statement correctly highlights the strategic significance of this battle in the overall conquest.  The inclusion of Bihar and Bengal in the context of further expansion demonstrates an understanding of the Sultanate's subsequent territorial growth.

2. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram represents a culmination of pre-Mughal architectural styles.
3. The Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri employed pillars of various temple styles to support flat roofs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mughal architecture.  The incorporation of running water features in palaces and gardens was indeed a hallmark of Mughal design, showcasing their engineering prowess and aesthetic preferences.  Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is widely considered a transitional masterpiece, bridging the gap between pre-Mughal and Mughal architectural styles. Its innovative design and grandeur mark it as a significant achievement.  Finally, the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri is renowned for its eclectic use of pillars, drawing inspiration from various temple architectural styles, reflecting Akbar's syncretic approach to design and his interest in incorporating diverse Indian traditions.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all three statements is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit crucial and verifiable aspects of Mughal architectural history.


**2. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mughal painting introduced new themes, colors, and forms, building upon existing Indian traditions.
2.  Daswant and Basawan were prominent painters during Jahangir's reign, known for their distinct styles.
3.  Mansur excelled in portrait and animal painting under Akbar's patronage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mughal painting significantly impacted Indian art by introducing new themes (court life, battles), color palettes, and artistic styles while incorporating and adapting elements from pre-existing Indian painting traditions.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Daswant and Basawan were indeed famous painters, their prominence was during Akbar's reign, not Jahangir's.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. Mansur, a celebrated Mughal painter, was known for his exceptional animal and portraiture, but he flourished under Jahangir's patronage, not Akbar's.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate regarding the broader impact of Mughal painting, and the correct answer is (b). Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the timeline of artists' careers or include factually inaccurate claims about their association with specific emperors.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire's administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar divided the empire into twelve subas in 1580, each governed by a Subedar and other officials.
2. The Mansabdari system, established under Akbar, rigidly defined the hierarchical structure of the Mughal nobility.
3.  The Jharoka Darshan, a daily ritual, allowed Akbar to directly interact with his subjects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's administrative reforms included the division of the empire into twelve subas (provinces), each headed by a Subedar and supported by other key officials like the Diwan (finance), Bakhshi (military paymaster), Sadr (religious affairs), Qazi (judicial), and Waqia-navis (chronicler). This decentralized administration ensured efficient governance across the vast empire. Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the Mansabdari system did establish a hierarchical structure, it was not entirely rigid.  It allowed for flexibility and promotions based on merit and loyalty. The system was more fluid than the statement implies. Statement 3 is also correct. The Jharoka Darshan was a daily public appearance by the emperor, allowing direct interaction with his subjects, addressing petitions, and maintaining a visible connection to the populace. This practice enhanced the emperor's accessibility and fostered a sense of connection between the ruler and the ruled.  Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to either the partially true or completely false nature of their included statements.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, was solely instrumental in securing Rajput alliances.
2.  Akbar abolished the Jizya tax in 1564, demonstrating religious tolerance.
3.  Rana Pratap of Mewar consistently refused to accept Mughal suzerainty, engaging in prolonged resistance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai strengthened his alliance with the Kachwaha Rajputs, it wasn't the sole factor securing Rajput alliances. Akbar employed a multi-faceted strategy, including offering high positions, religious tolerance, and strategic marriages to various Rajput rulers. Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the Jizya tax in 1564 was a significant step showcasing his policy of religious tolerance and aiming to integrate the Hindu population into the empire.  This move was crucial in securing the loyalty of many Rajput rulers. Statement 3 is also correct. Rana Pratap's unwavering resistance against Mughal suzerainty is a well-documented historical fact. His defiance, despite facing considerable pressure, highlights the complexities of Akbar's Rajput policy and the limits of his ability to secure complete subjugation of all Rajput states. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies present in their statements.


**5. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbaz at Bijapur is known for its exceptionally large single dome and acoustic properties.
2.  Ali Adil Shah I of Bijapur was known for his persecution of Hindu and Christian communities.
3.  The Charminar in Hyderabad was constructed under the reign of Ibrahim Qutb Shah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gol Gumbaz, a mausoleum in Bijapur, is renowned for its massive single dome, a remarkable feat of engineering, and its unique acoustic properties, where a whisper from one side of the chamber can be heard clearly on the opposite side. Statement 2 is incorrect. Ali Adil Shah I of Bijapur is actually known for his religious tolerance and interactions with both Hindu and Christian communities, not persecution. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Charminar in Hyderabad was built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, not Ibrahim Qutb Shah.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate, making (a) the correct answer. The other options are incorrect due to the presence of factually inaccurate statements about the religious policies of the rulers and the construction of the Charminar.


**6. With reference to the cultural developments during the period 1300-1500, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Delhi was initially constructed entirely from newly quarried material.
2.  The synthesis of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles is evident in many structures of this period.
3.  The translation of Sanskrit works into Persian was a common practice during this period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Delhi was largely constructed using materials from dismantled Hindu and Jain temples, highlighting the early interaction and fusion of architectural styles. Statement 2 is correct. This period witnessed a significant blending of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles, leading to unique hybrid structures that reflected the cultural exchange of the time. This is evident in many mosques, tombs, and palaces built during this era. Statement 3 is also correct. The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian was a common practice under the patronage of various rulers, facilitating cultural exchange and the dissemination of knowledge across communities. This process demonstrates the intellectual interaction between Hindu and Muslim scholars. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) include inaccurate statements regarding the materials used in the construction of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque.


**7. With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms focused primarily on strengthening the military apparatus.
2.  The land revenue system implemented by Sher Shah Suri was entirely based on the existing Mughal system.
3.  Sher Shah Suri's reign witnessed a significant development in Hindi literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but incomplete. While Sher Shah Suri did strengthen the military, his administrative reforms were far-reaching, encompassing land revenue, coinage, and infrastructure development.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system was a significant departure from existing systems, introducing a more efficient and equitable system of assessment based on actual land productivity.  Statement 3 is correct.  His reign saw the completion of significant works in Hindi literature, such as the Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jaisi, reflecting the cultural flourishing under his patronage. Therefore, only statements 1 (with the caveat mentioned above) and 3 are largely accurate. Option (c) is the best fit given the nuances of statement 1.

However, the Afghan threat persisted. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Battle of Ghaghra, while a victory for Babur, did not entirely eliminate the Afghan threat. Afghan resistance continued in eastern parts of the empire. Statement 3 is also incorrect. Babur's focus was less on establishing a large bureaucratic structure and more on consolidating his military power and securing his hold on the newly acquired territories.  His administrative reforms were limited compared to later Mughal rulers like Akbar.  Therefore, only statement 1 is largely accurate, making (a) the correct answer. The other options include factually inaccurate claims about the consequences of the Battle of Ghaghra and the nature of Babur's administrative reforms.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility increased significantly during Akbar's reign, reflecting his policy of religious tolerance and the integration of Rajput elites. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mansabdari system did allow for some social mobility, it wasn't absolute.  It was primarily based on hereditary status and loyalty to the emperor, limiting social mobility to some extent. Statement 3 is correct. Many Mughal nobles participated in commercial ventures, investing in trade, land, and other economic activities. This demonstrates the economic dynamism of the Mughal nobility and its involvement in various aspects of the economy. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions:


**1. With reference to the cultural and religious policies of the rulers of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sikandar Lodi's reign witnessed a significant increase in the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian, fostering cultural rapprochement between Hindus and Muslims.
2. Zain-ul-Abidin's rule in Kashmir is characterized by religious tolerance, the revocation of discriminatory policies against Hindus, and the restoration of temples and libraries.
3. Alauddin Khalji's reign was marked by extensive temple destruction and the forceful conversion of Hindus, reflecting a policy of religious intolerance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Sikandar Lodi's policy of promoting cultural exchange. His patronage of scholars and the translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian indicate an effort towards religious harmony, contrasting with the actions of some other rulers.  This demonstrates a nuanced approach to governance, aiming for administrative efficiency through the inclusion of Hindu scholars and officials.

Statement 2 correctly describes the tolerant and reconciliatory policies of Zain-ul-Abidin in Kashmir. His reversal of harsh anti-Hindu measures, restoration of temples, and encouragement of Sanskrit scholarship highlight his commitment to religious pluralism and societal harmony. This contrasts sharply with the religious persecution seen under other rulers, such as Sikandar Shah.  His actions exemplify a pragmatic approach to governance, prioritizing stability and prosperity.

Statement 3 presents a partially inaccurate portrayal of Alauddin Khalji's reign. While he did engage in campaigns that resulted in temple destruction, characterizing his entire reign as solely marked by "forceful conversion" and "religious intolerance" is an oversimplification.  His policies were primarily driven by political and economic considerations, though religious factors undoubtedly played a role.  His actions, therefore, represent a complex interplay of political ambition, economic strategy, and religious ideology, not a straightforward expression of religious intolerance.  Other aspects of his rule show a more pragmatic approach.


**2. With reference to the administrative and military structures of medieval Indian kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Iqta system, introduced by the Delhi Sultans, was a purely indigenous institution, predating the arrival of the Turks.
2.  The Rajput military organization was characterized by a high degree of centralized control and coordination, enabling effective large-scale campaigns.
3. The Ghurid army, in contrast to Rajput armies, possessed a superior cavalry force, better organization, and skilled mounted archers, contributing to their military successes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Iqta system, while adapted to the Indian context, was not an indigenous institution. It had its origins in Central Asian and West Asian administrative practices, adopted and modified by the Delhi Sultans to manage their vast territories and military forces.  The statement misrepresents the system's origins.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajput military structure was decentralized, characterized by a feudal system with numerous independent chiefs who often acted independently, hindering effective coordination during large-scale campaigns.  This decentralized structure was a significant factor in their defeat against more centrally organized armies like those of the Ghurids.  The statement contradicts the known historical reality of Rajput military organization.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ghurid army's success stemmed from its superior cavalry, better organization, and the effective use of mounted archers, tactics that proved decisive against the less-organized Rajput forces.  The statement accurately reflects the military advantages that the Ghurids possessed, such as superior mobility and ranged combat capabilities.  These factors were crucial in their victories.


**3.  With reference to the socio-economic conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standard of living for ordinary people, including peasants and artisans, remained consistently high throughout the period, even during times of famine.
2.  European travelers' accounts consistently portray a picture of widespread poverty and inadequate clothing among the common people, contrasting sharply with the opulence of the ruling classes.
3. The village economy was characterized by a high degree of equality, with minimal social stratification and equitable distribution of land and resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While periods of relative prosperity existed, the standard of living for ordinary people in medieval India was significantly impacted by factors such as frequent famines, high taxation, and social inequalities.  The statement paints an overly rosy picture of the socio-economic conditions, ignoring the hardships faced by the majority of the population.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  Accounts from European travelers consistently highlight the stark contrast between the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty and inadequate clothing among the common population, especially peasants and laborers.  The statement accurately reflects the observations of numerous foreign travelers who recorded the economic disparity in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The village society was characterized by significant social stratification and inequality in land ownership and resource distribution.  Caste played a major role in determining social status and economic opportunities, leading to exploitation of lower castes. The statement ignores the profound social hierarchies and inequalities prevalent in the village communities.  The reality was much more complex than the statement suggests.


**4. With reference to the cultural developments in the Deccan during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur actively patronized Sanskrit scholarship, highlighting a policy of religious tolerance and cultural synthesis.
2.  The Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda primarily focused on Persian language and culture, neglecting the development of local languages like Telugu and Urdu.
3.  The Deccan region witnessed a flourishing of Urdu literature, characterized by a blend of Persian, Hindi, and Telugu influences, reflecting cultural interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Adil Shahi rulers of Bijapur, particularly Ali Adil Shah I, demonstrated a notable level of religious tolerance and cultural synthesis.  Their patronage of Sanskrit scholarship, the employment of Hindu scholars, and their interactions with Hindu religious figures showcase a policy of inclusivity. This indicates a deliberate policy of fostering cultural exchange and coexistence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda, while known for its patronage of Persian, also actively supported the development of local languages like Telugu and Urdu.  The statement is an oversimplification and ignores the dynasty's contribution to the development of local literary traditions.  Their support for Dakhini Urdu, a unique blend of Persian and local languages, is a notable example of their cultural influence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Deccan region, under various dynasties, saw the flourishing of Urdu literature.  This development is characterized by its unique blend of Persian, Hindi, and Telugu influences, reflecting the rich cultural interplay of the region. The statement accurately reflects the linguistic and cultural dynamism of the Deccan during that period.  The emergence of Dakhini Urdu is a key example of this phenomenon.


**1. With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri, built by Akbar, incorporated various types of pillars used in different temples, supporting flat roofs.
2.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi, constructed by Shah Jahan, primarily utilized marble, showcasing intricate pietra dura inlay work.
3. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram exemplifies a pre-Mughal architectural style, marking a transition point to the Mughal style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri is renowned for its unique architectural blend.  It used various temple pillar styles to support flat roofs, reflecting Akbar's eclectic approach and interest in incorporating diverse architectural elements. This demonstrates his inclusive approach and the fusion of existing Indian architectural traditions with Mughal designs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shah Jahan was a master of marble architecture, the Jama Masjid in Delhi is primarily constructed of red sandstone, not marble. The Taj Mahal, another of his creations, is where pietra dura inlay work is predominantly featured. The Jama Masjid, though magnificent, employs a different material and decorative style.  This highlights the variations in material choices and stylistic preferences even within the works of a single emperor.

Statement 3 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is indeed considered a pinnacle of pre-Mughal architecture.  It represents a culmination of earlier styles and significantly influenced the subsequent development of Mughal architecture. Its design and construction techniques paved the way for the innovations and grandeur seen in later Mughal buildings. This showcases the evolution of architectural styles and the continuity between pre-Mughal and Mughal periods.


**2. With reference to Mughal Gardens, consider the following statements:**

2. The Shalimar Gardens are located in Agra, showcasing the Mughal style of formal gardens with running water.
3. The Nishat Bagh, a Mughal garden in Kashmir, is known for its unique terraced design and incorporation of local Kashmiri architectural elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's love for gardens is well documented, and he established numerous gardens near Agra and Lahore.  While many have been lost to time, some have survived, demonstrating the longevity of Mughal gardening traditions and their integration into the landscape. This emphasizes the cultural significance of Mughal gardens and their impact on landscape design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Shalimar Gardens are situated in Lahore, Pakistan, not Agra.  While they exemplify the Mughal style of formal gardens with water features, their location is crucial to understanding their historical context and regional variations within Mughal garden design.  This highlights the geographical spread of Mughal influence and the regional adaptations of their architectural styles.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Nishat Bagh in Kashmir is a prominent example of a Mughal garden. Its terraced design and incorporation of local Kashmiri architectural elements showcase the adaptation of Mughal garden design to different geographical and cultural contexts. This illustrates the flexibility and adaptability of Mughal aesthetics and their integration with pre-existing regional styles.


**3. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mughal painting reached its zenith under Jahangir, known for his discerning eye and patronage of artists like Mansur, who excelled in animal and portraiture.
2.  Akbar's painting workshop drew artists from diverse backgrounds, including lower castes, blending Hindu and Muslim artistic traditions.
3.  European painting techniques, introduced by Portuguese priests during Aurangzeb's reign, significantly altered the Mughal style, leading to the widespread adoption of perspective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jahangir's reign is widely considered the high point of Mughal painting. His keen eye for detail and his patronage of exceptionally talented artists like Mansur, who specialized in realistic animal and portraiture, significantly advanced the art form. This highlights the importance of individual patronage in shaping artistic trends and the development of specialized artistic skills within the Mughal court.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's establishment of a royal painting workshop was a landmark event. It brought together artists from diverse backgrounds, including lower castes, fostering a unique synthesis of Hindu and Muslim artistic traditions. The collaborative nature of this workshop is a significant aspect of Mughal painting's development, demonstrating the inclusive nature of Akbar's patronage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The introduction of European painting techniques, particularly the principle of perspective, occurred during Akbar's reign, not Aurangzeb's. While Aurangzeb's lack of interest in painting led to the dispersal of artists, the significant stylistic changes influenced by European techniques predate his reign.  This points to the importance of correctly associating historical events and artistic developments with the relevant rulers.


**4. With reference to the consolidation of the Mughal Empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's victory at the Battle of Panipat in 1556 against Hemu decisively secured his claim to the Mughal throne and marked the beginning of his reign.
2.  Akbar's conflict with Bairam Khan, his regent, highlighted tensions between the young emperor and the powerful nobility, shaping Akbar's early governance.
3.  Akbar's Rajput policy involved exclusively matrimonial alliances, securing unwavering loyalty and eliminating any future conflicts with Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Panipat (1556) was a pivotal moment in Akbar's rise to power. His victory over Hemu, the powerful Afghan commander, solidified his control over the Mughal Empire and marked the beginning of his long and impactful reign. This emphasizes the role of military victories in establishing imperial authority and consolidating power.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's early reign was marked by significant tension between the young emperor and his powerful regent, Bairam Khan. This conflict demonstrated the challenges faced by a young ruler in asserting his authority over a powerful and potentially rebellious nobility. This highlights the complex dynamics of power within the Mughal court and the importance of establishing the emperor's sole authority.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Akbar's Rajput policy was far more nuanced than solely relying on matrimonial alliances. While strategic marriages were a key component, Akbar also employed other methods, such as granting high offices and offering religious tolerance, to secure the loyalty of Rajput rulers.  This showcases the multifaceted nature of Akbar's political strategies and his ability to adapt to different circumstances.  The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in India before the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Qutub Minar, a towering structure, was initiated by Qutbuddin Aibak and completed by Iltutmish, showcasing a unique blend of Indian and West Asian architectural elements.
2.  The Alai Darwaza, an entrance to the Qutub complex, exemplifies the mastery of arch and dome construction techniques achieved by Indian craftsmen during the Khalji period.
3.  The Tughlaq architecture, characterized by sloping walls ("batter") and a combination of arch and lintel-beam principles, reached its zenith under Firuz Shah Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Qutub Minar's construction, initiated by Qutbuddin Aibak and completed by Iltutmish, is indeed a significant example of early Indo-Islamic architecture. It blends architectural elements from both Indian and West Asian traditions, demonstrating the early fusion of styles. This illustrates the process of cultural exchange and the adaptation of foreign architectural forms to the Indian context.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alai Darwaza, built during the Khalji period, is a remarkable example of architectural skill.  It represents a significant advancement in the understanding and application of arch and dome construction techniques by Indian craftsmen. This highlights the ongoing development of architectural techniques and the increasing sophistication of Indian craftsmanship during the Sultanate period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Tughlaq style is characterized by sloping walls ("batter") and the combination of arch and lintel-beam principles, its peak was during the reigns of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and Muhammad bin Tughlaq, not Firuz Shah Tughlaq.  Firuz Shah's buildings, while significant, did not showcase the "batter" technique as prominently.  This shows the importance of precise attribution of architectural styles to specific rulers and periods.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Pratihara and Pala empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pratihara kings are believed to have had the finest cavalry in the country, but there is no mention of war chariots.
2. The Pala infantry consisted of soldiers drawn from diverse regions including Malwa, Khasa (Assam), Lata (south Gujarat), and Karnataka.
3.  The Rashtrakutas, unlike the Palas and Pratiharas, did not have their own navies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Pratihara kings possessed a superior cavalry force and that war chariots were obsolete during their reign.  This highlights their military prowess and adaptation to changing warfare technologies.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly mentions the diverse composition of the Pala infantry, recruited from various regions across India, demonstrating the empire's wide reach and the integration of soldiers from different geographical and possibly cultural backgrounds into their military structure. This reflects a complex administrative and logistical network capable of managing a multi-ethnic army.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the Pala kings, and *perhaps* the Rashtrakutas, possessed their own navies. The uncertainty regarding the Rashtrakutas does not confirm the absence of a navy.  The "perhaps" indicates a lack of definitive evidence, not a categorical denial of their naval capabilities.  The presence or absence of a navy is a significant indicator of an empire's maritime power and trade connections.


**2. With reference to the administrative divisions and officials in ancient Indian empires, consider the following statements:**

1. In the Pratihara empire, the 'visayapati' was a higher-ranking official than the 'uparika'.
2. The Rashtrakuta kingdom employed 'rashrapați' as provincial governors, who held similar functions to the 'uparika' in the Pala and Pratihara empires.
3.  The village headman, whose position was often hereditary, was assisted by village elders called 'grama mahajana' or 'grama mahattara' in the Rashtrakuta kingdom but not in the Pala or Pratihara kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the 'uparika' was the governor of a province (akta), while the 'visayapati' headed a district (mandala or visaya). This implies a hierarchical structure where the 'uparika' held a higher administrative position.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Rashtrakuta 'rashrapați' performed similar functions to the 'uparika' in the other empires.  This illustrates the similarities in administrative structures across different kingdoms, despite variations in nomenclature.  It also shows a common approach to provincial governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text details the role of 'grama mahajana' or 'grama mahattara' in assisting the village headman within the Rashtrakuta kingdom, it doesn't exclude their presence in the Pala or Pratihara empires.  The absence of explicit mention in the text for the latter two does not confirm their absence.  The presence or absence of these village councils points to variations in local governance structures.


**3. With reference to the social structure and caste system during the period discussed, consider the following statements:**

1.  According to Yagyavalkya, a Brahman could share food only with members of his own caste.
2.  D.C. Sircar noted the gradual elevation of the Shudras' social position, evidenced by their eligibility for 'smarta' rituals.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Yagyavalkya permitted Brahmans to dine with farmers, barbers, milkmen, and family friends, directly contradicting the statement. This highlights the complexities and nuances within the caste system, showing that interactions between different castes were not always strictly prohibited.


Statement 2 is correct.  The text supports D.C. Sircar's observation regarding the improving status of the Shudras, citing their increased participation in 'smarta' rituals. This demonstrates gradual social mobility and change within the rigid caste hierarchy.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the Kayastha caste originated from a diverse group of individuals from different castes, including Brahmins and Shudras, who worked in royal establishments. This points to the fluidity and evolution of caste identities over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions that some smriti writers approved of sati, while others allowed it under certain conditions, indicating a lack of unanimous condemnation of the practice. This highlights the diversity of opinions within religious and legal texts regarding the practice.


Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the seclusion of upper-class women but notes the absence of a universal system of purdah. This demonstrates the complexities of gender roles and social practices, showing variations across different social strata and regions.  The absence of universal purdah is a significant detail in understanding the social dynamics of the time.


**5. With reference to the economic conditions of artisans and laborers during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement played a pivotal role in promoting regional languages.  The saints' use of vernacular languages in their devotional poetry and teachings made these languages accessible to wider audiences, fostering their development as literary mediums and challenging the dominance of Sanskrit.  This popularization of regional languages through religious discourse had a profound impact on their growth and standardization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that in many pre-Turkish regional kingdoms, regional languages like Tamil and Kannada were used for administrative purposes alongside Sanskrit. This shows the prior existence of a system where local languages held administrative significance. The statement misrepresents the pre-existing administrative use of regional languages.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage shows that while Persian was the language of administration and the elite, the Mughal emperors, particularly Akbar, didn't actively discourage regional languages.  Instead, there was a degree of patronage, translation efforts, and the integration of regional languages into the cultural landscape. The statement presents a misleading simplification of the complex linguistic policies of the Mughal era.


**3. With reference to the musical traditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's patronage of Tansen of Gwalior significantly advanced the development of new ragas.
2.  Aurangzeb's reign witnessed a complete suppression of all forms of musical expression in the Mughal court.
3.  The largest number of books on classical Indian music written in Persian were composed during the reign of Shah Jahan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's patronage of Tansen, a renowned musician from Gwalior, led to the creation of many new melodies and ragas. This patronage illustrates the Mughal emperors' support for musical innovation and their role in shaping the evolution of Indian classical music.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb is known for his conservative religious views, the passage indicates that he banned singing in the court but not the playing of musical instruments, and that music continued to flourish within the haram (women's quarters) and among nobles.  The statement presents an oversimplification of Aurangzeb's impact on music, neglecting the nuances of his policies and the persistence of musical practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage states that the largest number of books on classical Indian music in Persian were written during Aurangzeb's reign, not Shah Jahan's. This highlights the persistence of Persian as a language of scholarship even during periods of religious conservatism. The statement wrongly attributes the peak of Persian-language musicological writings to a different Mughal emperor.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti and Sufi movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kabir and Nanak strongly advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity and criticized aspects of both religions that hindered this unity.
2.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu, excluding other deities.
3.  The Sufi saints actively rejected all forms of Hindu religious practices and beliefs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both Kabir and Nanak emphasized the unity of God and condemned practices within both Hinduism and Islam that promoted division and discrimination. Their teachings transcended sectarian boundaries and fostered a climate of religious tolerance and inclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement had various branches, it included the worship of Rama and Krishna (incarnations of Vishnu), but also encompassed the devotion to other deities and emphasized a personal, emotional connection with the divine, irrespective of specific forms or rituals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage highlights the interaction and exchange between Sufi saints and Hindu religious figures.  Sufi saints often engaged with Hindu ideas and practices, incorporating elements into their own mystical traditions and fostering a degree of religious syncretism. The statement misrepresents the nature of Sufi engagement with Hinduism, which was characterized by dialogue and mutual influence rather than outright rejection.


**5. With reference to the political developments in North India during the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1.  The death of Rana Sanga significantly weakened the Rajput confederacy's ability to resist the Mughals.
2.  The Afghans, despite initial defeats, continued to pose a significant threat to the early Mughal empire.
3.  Babur's victory at the Battle of Khanwa marked the complete end of Afghan influence in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rana Sanga's death dealt a severe blow to the Rajput confederacy, disrupting its unity and weakening its ability to effectively resist the Mughal expansion. His demise removed a powerful leader who had united various Rajput states against Babur.

Statement 2 is correct.  Although Babur defeated the Afghans in several battles, they remained a persistent threat to the early Mughal empire. Their continued resistance and efforts to regain power highlight the challenges faced by the Mughals in consolidating their rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Babur's victory at Khanwa was significant but did not mark the complete end of Afghan influence in India.  Afghan resistance continued, and they remained a factor in the political landscape for quite some time, necessitating further Mughal military action. The statement overstates the extent of Babur’s victory.

The latter were primarily created in South and East India, showcasing the continued patronage of Sanskrit learning by regional rulers. The simultaneous flourishing of both Persian and Sanskrit literature is a key feature of this period.  There is no element of contradiction or misleading information.

This highlights that these languages were not newly emerging but already established in the social fabric. Statement 2 correctly identifies the decline of Sanskrit's prestige and the role of Bhakti saints in popularizing vernaculars as key factors in their rise.  The Bhakti movement's use of regional languages for religious expression significantly boosted their status and literary use. Statement 3 is also accurate, demonstrating the role of Muslim rulers in promoting these languages.  Nusrat Shah's patronage of Bengali translations shows that the rise of regional languages was not solely a Hindu phenomenon but a broader cultural shift.  The combined effect of these factors led to the maturity and flourishing of many regional languages.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its interaction with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture, was completed under the fifth Guru, Arjun Dev, who also adopted a more aristocratic lifestyle, collecting offerings from Sikhs to support the movement.
2.  Guru Arjun Dev's imprisonment and death under Jahangir, ostensibly for aiding the rebel prince Khusrau, marked a significant turning point in Sikh-Mughal relations.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, describing the completion of the Adi Granth under Guru Arjun Dev and his shift towards a more visible and financially secure leadership style. This reflects the movement's growing organizational strength. Statement 2 accurately highlights the pivotal event of Guru Arjun Dev's execution under Jahangir. This event, though presented as politically motivated, significantly impacted the Sikh community and shaped their future relationship with the Mughal authority. Statement 3 correctly summarizes R.P. Tripathi's perspective on later Sikh-Mughal conflicts, emphasizing the role of political and personal factors over purely religious reasons.  These conflicts, while sometimes involving religious undertones, were primarily driven by power struggles and territorial disputes.  The statements are factually accurate and present a nuanced understanding of this historical period.


**4.  Consider the following statements about the cultural and religious developments during the reign of Akbar:**

1.  Akbar's religious policy, characterized by the abolition of the jizya tax and the promotion of religious tolerance, aimed to foster unity within his vast empire.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established by Akbar, initially focused on discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives from various faiths, leading to debates on core religious beliefs.

This was a deliberate attempt to create a more inclusive society. Statement 2 accurately recounts the evolution of the Ibadat Khana, starting as a forum for Muslim theologians and expanding to include diverse religious perspectives.  This reflects Akbar's intellectual curiosity and his search for a synthesis of religious beliefs. Statement 3 correctly explains Akbar's declaration (maazar), clarifying its intention to resolve conflicting religious interpretations to maintain social peace, rather than claiming infallibility.  The misinterpretation highlights the complexities of interpreting historical documents.  The combined effect of these actions shaped Akbar's image as a tolerant and inclusive ruler.


**5. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates and their cultural contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah of Bijapur was known for his religious tolerance, engaging in discussions with both Hindu and Muslim saints and inviting Catholic missionaries to his court.

Statement 2 accurately describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of music and his composition of "Kitab-i-Nauras," highlighting his artistic inclinations and support for various religious communities, including the Bhakti movement center at Pandharpur. Statement 3 correctly highlights the development of Dakhini Urdu under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah and the construction of the Charminar, illustrating the Golconda Sultanate's contributions to language and architecture. The combined contributions of these Sultanates enriched the cultural tapestry of the Deccan region.  The statements are not contradictory and represent accurate historical facts.

**1. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Faizi, brother of Abul Fazl, primarily contributed to Akbar's translation department, overseeing the translation of the Ramayana into Persian.
2.  Utbi and Naziri, while Persian poets born in Persia, significantly contributed to the Persian literary scene in the Mughal court, enriching it with their distinct styles.
3.  The translation of the Mahabharata into Persian was primarily undertaken by a team of Hindu scholars employed in Akbar’s translation department.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Faizi was instrumental in Akbar's translation department and a leading poet, the text states he oversaw the translation of the *Mahabharata*, not the *Ramayana*.  The *Ramayana* translation is mentioned elsewhere in the provided source, but not attributed to Faizi.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Utbi and Naziri as prominent Persian poets who migrated to India and contributed significantly to the Mughal court's cultural prominence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Although Hindu scholars contributed to Sanskrit works during this period and some may have been involved in the translation department, the text explicitly attributes the *Mahabharata* translation to Faizi's supervision.  It doesn't state that it was *primarily* done by Hindu scholars. The statement misrepresents the degree of Hindu involvement.


**2. With reference to the development of regional languages in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages was significantly influenced by the loss of prestige experienced by Sanskrit and the Brahmins, coupled with the adoption of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Nusrat Shah's patronage is mentioned, it is not presented as the *primary* factor driving the development of regional languages. The Bhakti movement and socio-political shifts were equally, if not more, significant. The statement overemphasizes the role of Muslim patronage.

These questions are designed to challenge candidates' knowledge and understanding of Medieval Indian history, culture, and literature, requiring them to carefully analyze information and identify subtle inaccuracies.  The distractors are carefully chosen to reflect common misconceptions or incomplete understandings of the topic.


**1. With reference to the cultural exchange during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Faizi, brother of Abul Fazl, oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian, showcasing the Mughal patronage of Indian literature.
2.  The Persian language, adopted as the court language, facilitated the integration of Persian and Indian literary traditions, as exemplified by Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan's blend of Bhakti poetry with Persian ideals.
3.  Aurangzeb, despite his orthodox views, indirectly fostered the growth of classical Indian music by allowing its continued patronage within the royal harem and by nobles, leading to numerous treatises on music being written in Persian during his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of cultural exchange during the Mughal era. Statement 1 correctly identifies Faizi's role in translating the Mahabharata, a significant act of cultural assimilation under Akbar's reign. This translation project demonstrates the Mughal emperors' interest in and support for Indian literature and their efforts to bridge the cultural gap between Persian and Indian traditions. Statement 2 accurately highlights the role of Persian as the court language and its impact on the fusion of Persian and Indian literary styles. Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan's work serves as a prime example of this synthesis, demonstrating the mutual influence of Persian and Hindi literary traditions during the Mughal period.  Statement 3 is also correct. While Aurangzeb is known for his conservative religious policies, his personal interest in music and the continued patronage of music within the royal household and among nobles resulted in a significant output of Persian-language treatises on Indian classical music.  This demonstrates the complex and often contradictory nature of Aurangzeb's reign, where even strict religious policies didn't entirely suppress other cultural activities. The other options are incorrect because they fail to encompass the comprehensive and nuanced nature of cultural exchange during the Mughal period, omitting crucial elements of literary and musical interactions.


**2. With reference to the literary contributions during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi's "Padmavat," written in medieval Brij Bhasha, employed the story of Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor as an allegory to explore Sufi ideas and Hindu concepts of love and devotion.
2.  Tulsidas, a prominent Hindi poet, advocated for a caste system based on individual merit rather than birth, reflecting a humanistic approach in his devotional poetry centered on Rama.
3.  Eknath and Tukaram, significant figures in Marathi literature, championed the use of Marathi as a language capable of expressing profound spiritual sentiments, challenging the dominance of Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of literary contributions during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly identifies Malik Muhammad Jaisi's "Padmavat" and its allegorical use of the Chittor siege to convey Sufi and Hindu philosophical perspectives on love and devotion.  This highlights the intermingling of religious and literary traditions during this period. Statement 2 accurately describes Tulsidas's humanistic views on the caste system and his significant contribution to Hindi literature through his devotional poetry dedicated to Rama. His emphasis on individual merit challenged the rigid social hierarchy of the time. Statement 3 correctly points to Eknath and Tukaram's pivotal role in promoting Marathi literature and their assertion of Marathi's literary capabilities, contrasting it with the traditional preference for Sanskrit.  Their contributions demonstrate the growth and assertion of regional languages during the medieval period. The other options are incorrect because they exclude significant figures and literary movements, presenting an incomplete picture of the rich literary landscape of medieval India.


**3. With reference to the religious and social movements of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement, active during the 16th and 17th centuries, saw the rise of the Sikh movement in Punjab and the Maharashtra Dharma in Maharashtra, both emphasizing devotion and challenging traditional religious orthodoxy.
2.  Guru Arjun, the fifth Sikh Guru, compiled the Adi Granth, and despite his aristocratic lifestyle and collection of offerings, his conflict with Jahangir wasn't primarily rooted in religious differences but in political factors, according to some historians.
3.  Dadu, a saint who preached a non-sectarian path, rejecting the scriptures of both Hinduism and Islam, and Tukaram, who emphasized Bhakti in Maharashtra, exemplify the liberal religious trends that existed alongside the orthodox movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of religious and social movements during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Bhakti movement as a backdrop for the emergence of the Sikh movement in Punjab and the Maharashtra Dharma, both of which challenged traditional religious structures and promoted devotion.  Statement 2 accurately describes Guru Arjun's role in compiling the Adi Granth and his relatively affluent lifestyle.  The statement correctly notes that historians often attribute the conflict between Guru Arjun and Jahangir to political factors rather than solely religious differences, highlighting the complexities of the relationship between religious movements and political power. Statement 3 correctly points to Dadu and Tukaram as examples of the liberal religious trends that existed concurrently with orthodox movements, emphasizing the diversity of religious thought during this period. Dadu's non-sectarian approach and Tukaram's Bhakti movement in Maharashtra showcase the wide spectrum of religious beliefs and practices.  The other options incorrectly exclude significant aspects of religious and social dynamics during the medieval period, providing an incomplete and unbalanced perspective.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of the Deccan during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jai Singh I, a Mughal politician, advocated for an aggressive policy in the Deccan, aiming for the conquest of Bijapur as a stepping stone to controlling the entire Deccan and Karnataka.
2.  The Bijapur campaign of 1665, led by Jai Singh I, failed due to the united front formed by the Deccan states against the Mughals, their guerilla tactics, and Jai Singh's lack of siege weaponry.
3.  Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda in 1686 and 1687, respectively, while a military triumph, didn't resolve the Maratha issue, leading to a prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful struggle against them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the political dynamics in the Deccan during the Mughal era. Statement 1 correctly identifies Jai Singh I's advocacy for an assertive approach in the Deccan, aiming to conquer Bijapur to secure control over the region. This reflects the strategic importance of Bijapur and the larger ambitions of the Mughal empire. Statement 2 correctly explains the failure of Jai Singh I's 1665 Bijapur campaign. The Deccan states' united resistance, their effective use of guerilla warfare, and Jai Singh's lack of adequate siege equipment all contributed to the campaign's failure.  This highlights the challenges the Mughals faced in subduing the Deccan. Statement 3 correctly points out the long-term consequences of Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda.  While militarily successful, these conquests did not solve the Maratha problem, leading to a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful war that weakened the Mughal empire.  The other options are incorrect as they omit crucial aspects of the Mughal-Deccan conflict, presenting an incomplete understanding of the historical events.



**5. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rapid decline after Aurangzeb's death was solely due to the internal conflicts among nobles and the rise of ambitious provincial governors, ignoring the role of Aurangzeb's policies.
2.  While agricultural production increased during the 17th century, it couldn't keep pace with the expanding demands of the ruling class, exacerbated by rising prices and the inefficient jagirdari system.
3.  The Mughal empire's neglect of modern science and technology, coupled with Aurangzeb's inflexible policies that alienated both Hindus and some segments of the Muslim population, contributed significantly to its decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 offer different perspectives on the decline of the Mughal Empire.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While internal conflicts and the rise of ambitious governors were significant factors, attributing the decline solely to post-Aurangzeb developments overlooks Aurangzeb's own policies that contributed to the empire's weakening. Statement 2 is correct. It accurately points to the imbalance between slow agricultural growth and the rapidly increasing demands of the ruling class.  Rising prices, inefficient revenue collection through the jagirdari system, and social inequalities all played a significant role in the empire's economic instability. Statement 3 is also correct. The Mughal empire's stagnation in adopting modern science and technology put it at a disadvantage compared to rising European powers.  Aurangzeb's rigid policies, while religiously orthodox, alienated significant segments of the population, hindering the empire's unity and stability.  Option (c) is the most accurate because it combines the economic issues with the socio-political effects of Aurangzeb's reign and the technological backwardness of the empire.  Option (a) is too simplistic, option (b) overlooks the crucial political and social aspects, and option (d) includes the inaccurate statement 1.

The Ghaznavids' initial focus on plunder and the Rajput resistance are well-established historical facts. The economic role of Muslim traders and the subsequent growth of Muslim trading colonies are also mentioned. Finally, the arrival of Sufi preachers and the consequent religious interaction, particularly in Lahore, are accurately depicted.  Therefore, option (c) is the only correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the multifaceted nature of early Muslim-Hindu interaction as described in the source.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to synthesize information from different parts of the passage.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe events leading up to and immediately following the Ghurid conquests. Alauddin's actions in Ghazni are accurately portrayed, setting the stage for the Ghurid expansion. Muizzuddin's failed Gujarat campaign and subsequent strategy are also correctly stated. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The First Battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a Ghurid defeat, not a victory for Prithviraj Chauhan, as the passage clearly states that the Ghurid forces were completely routed.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option (a) the right choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) misinterpret key events of the Ghurid conquests, demonstrating the need for precise historical knowledge.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect historical information.

3.  The superior organization, speed, and tactical prowess of the Turkish cavalry, particularly their mounted archers and heavy cavalry, were decisive factors in Muizzuddin Muhammad's victory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

All three statements accurately reflect the context and outcome of the Second Battle of Tarain. The battle's historical significance as a turning point is undeniable. The explanation for Jaichandra's lack of support emphasizes the pre-existing rivalry, correctly dismissing the romanticized abduction legend as a later embellishment.  Finally, the description of the Turkish military advantage in terms of cavalry tactics and organization is directly supported by the text. Option (c) is therefore the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) omit key aspects of the battle's context and outcome, demonstrating the importance of understanding the nuances of historical events.  The question assesses factual recall, analytical, and evaluative skills.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the sequence of events following the Battle of Tarain. The conquest of the Ganga Valley and the defeat of Kanauj are correctly linked.  The Battle of Chandawar and Jaichandra's death are also accurately described. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Qutbuddin Aibak played a significant role in the subsequent consolidation of Turkish power, the passage does not state that he was appointed governor immediately after Chandawar. The text says Muizzuddin returned to Ghazni *after* Tarain, leaving Aibak in charge.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate the need for precise chronological understanding and attention to detail in historical analysis.  The question tests factual recall and chronological understanding.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Rashtrakutas had a strong army, their military success wasn't solely attributed to their infantry.  They utilized a combined arms approach, including cavalry and elephants.  The text doesn't highlight infantry as their primary military strength.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Hemachandra's contributions to both Sanskrit and Apabhramsha are well-established in the history of medieval Indian literature.

Statement 2 is correct. The decline of Sanskrit's dominance, coupled with the rise of regional languages, fostered the development of modern North Indian languages. The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to this process.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bhakti saints actively used regional languages to spread their message, thereby contributing significantly to the growth and development of these languages.  Their use of vernacular languages was key to their success in reaching a wider audience.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate reflections of the literary and cultural context of the period.


**7. With reference to the impact of the Turkish conquests on North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest, culminating in the battles of Tarain, marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The initial Turkish raids into the Gangetic valley were primarily driven by economic motives, aiming to establish lucrative trade routes with Central Asia.
3.  The Rajput rulers offered little resistance to the Turkish invasions, primarily due to internal conflicts and lack of military preparedness.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ghurid conquests, particularly the battles of Tarain, undeniably marked a watershed moment, paving the way for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and a significant shift in Indian political landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While trade was a factor, the initial Turkish incursions were primarily motivated by plunder and expansionist ambitions, not solely economic gains. The economic benefits were a consequence of conquest rather than the primary motivation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Rajput rulers actively resisted the Turkish invasions, achieving victories on several occasions. Their resistance, although ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, was significant and prolonged.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the historical context of the Turkish conquests.


**8. With reference to the reign of Sikandar Lodi and its impact, consider the following statements:**

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikandar Lodi's reign, while not marked by extreme persecution, witnessed policies that favored Islam.  He reimposed the jizya tax on Hindus, and his actions indicate a preference for Islamic dominance.

Statement 2 is correct. Agra's founding under Sikandar Lodi is a well-documented historical fact.  Its strategic location was crucial for controlling trade routes and expanding influence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sikandar Lodi's military campaigns mainly focused on consolidating his power in northern India and expanding towards the west and east, not primarily on the south. His campaigns targeted regions like Gwaliyar and eastern Rajasthan, not Vijayanagara.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1. Abul Fazl's literary style profoundly influenced Persian prose writing for generations, while his brother Faizi played a key role in translating the Mahabharata into Persian.

1.  Guru Har Govind's conflicts with the Mughal emperors were primarily driven by religious differences and a desire to establish an independent Sikh kingdom.
2.  Dara Shikoh's efforts to bridge the gap between Hinduism and Islam were significant, as shown by his translation of the Gita into Persian and his assertion of the compatibility of the Vedas and Quran.
3.  The Sikh movement during this period remained largely apolitical, focusing primarily on spiritual matters and avoiding conflicts with the Mughal rulers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Guru Har Govind's conflicts with the Mughals were primarily political and circumstantial, not primarily driven by religious differences or a desire for an independent Sikh kingdom at that time.

Statement 2 is correct. Dara Shikoh's efforts to promote interfaith understanding are well-documented. His translations and writings emphasized the commonalities between Hinduism and Islam.

Statement 3 is largely correct. While some conflicts arose, the Sikh movement during this period did not actively challenge the Mughal authority in a large-scale, organized way.  Their conflicts were more localized and often related to specific events.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely accurate.  While statement 3 is not entirely accurate in a strict sense, it is a more accurate description than statement 1.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is also correct. The text mentions Utbi and Naziri as leading Persian poets who migrated to India, enriching the Mughal court's literary landscape.  Their presence highlights the cultural exchange and the flourishing of Persian literature during the Mughal period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement did influence lyrical poetry, its impact was widespread across North India (Bengali, Oriya, Hindi, Rajasthani, and Gujarati), not limited to South India.  The statement's focus on the Ramayana also oversimplifies the diverse themes explored within Bhakti poetry, which encompassed a broader range of devotional and philosophical subjects related to both Rama and Krishna.


**2. With reference to the religious and cultural interactions during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh scriptures, Adi Granth or Granth Sahib, were completed during the reign of Guru Har Govind.
2.  Guru Arjun's conflict with Jahangir stemmed primarily from religious differences and doctrinal disputes.
3.  Dara Shikoh, known for his liberal views, commissioned the translation of the Gita into Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Adi Granth was completed under Guru Arjun Dev, not Guru Har Govind.  This highlights the crucial role of Guru Arjun Dev in consolidating Sikh religious texts and establishing the Granth Sahib's importance within the Sikh faith.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there was a conflict, it stemmed from accusations of Guru Arjun supporting a rebel prince (Khusrau), not primarily from religious differences. This shows the complex interplay between political and religious factors in the Mughal empire.

Statement 3 is correct. Dara Shikoh's intellectual curiosity and liberal religious views are well documented. His commissioning of the Gita's translation into Persian underscores his efforts to promote understanding between different religious traditions.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious dynamics of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan, a significant Dharmashastra writer, advocated for a flexible caste system based on individual merit rather than birth.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal religious policies and advocated for the re-imposition of the jizya tax.
3.  Tukaram, a prominent Bhakti saint, challenged traditional caste hierarchies and emphasized the importance of individual devotion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Raghunandan, while influential, actually reinforced Brahmanical privileges and a rigid caste system, not a flexible one based on merit. This highlights the contrasting viewpoints within Hindu society during the medieval period.

Statement 2 is correct. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's syncretic policies and his advocacy for a stricter interpretation of Islam, including the re-imposition of the jizya tax, represent a significant counter-movement to Akbar's religious tolerance.

Statement 3 is correct. Tukaram's emphasis on individual devotion and his disregard for strict caste boundaries exemplify the egalitarian aspects of the Bhakti movement.  His own status as a Shudra further underscores this challenge to established social hierarchies.


**4. With reference to the Mughal nobility and its role in the economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus constituted approximately 33% of the Mughal nobility.
2.  The Mughal nobility's high salaries and lifestyles significantly contributed to the growth of trade and commerce in India.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The percentage of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar was significantly lower than 33%, closer to 16% according to the text. This demonstrates the gradual increase in Hindu representation within the Mughal administration over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the Mughal nobility's extravagant spending and their involvement in various economic activities, including land ownership, lending, and trade. Their economic activities stimulated various sectors, thus contributing to economic growth in various ways.

Statement 3 is correct. Mir Jumla's extensive commercial activities, including his large fleet involved in international trade, showcase the economic influence and power wielded by some prominent Mughal nobles.


**5. With reference to the Deccan and South India during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The treaties of 1636 between Shah Jahan and the Deccan sultanates (Bijapur and Golconda) resulted in the complete subjugation of these states under Mughal rule.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur was known for his patronage of Sanskrit scholars, including Waman Pandit, and his interest in music and the arts.
3.  The Charminar in Hyderabad was constructed during the reign of Ibrahim Qutb Shah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1636 treaties established Mughal suzerainty, not complete subjugation. This demonstrates the complex political dynamics in the Deccan, where Mughal influence coexisted with a degree of autonomy for the Deccan sultanates.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of Sanskrit scholars and his interest in music and the arts, showcasing the cultural syncretism and the coexistence of different cultural traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Charminar was built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, not Ibrahim Qutb Shah.  This points to the importance of understanding the correct chronological sequence of events and rulers in the history of Golconda.


**6. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements in the context of the weakening Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily driven by religious motivations and a desire to establish a separate religious state.
2. The Satnamis, a religious group primarily composed of peasants, artisans and low caste people, clashed with the Mughal state at Narnaul.
3. The Afghan uprisings under Bhagu and Akmal Khan were primarily motivated by a desire for regional autonomy and the establishment of an independent Afghan state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While religious factors might have played a role in some Jat uprisings, their primary cause was socio-economic issues, particularly land revenue and the relationship between peasants and the Mughal administration.  The establishment of a separate religious state was not the primary aim.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states the Satnamis' conflict with the Mughal state at Narnaul, highlighting the participation of various social groups in resistance movements against Mughal rule.

Statement 3 is correct. The Afghan uprisings, led by figures like Bhagu and Akmal Khan, were significantly driven by aspirations for regional independence and the establishment of a separate Afghan state. This points to the diverse motivations behind resistance movements across different groups within the Mughal Empire.


**7.  With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, solely focused his teachings on the Brahmanical class and upheld traditional caste distinctions.
2. Kabir, a prominent Bhakti saint, vehemently opposed idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious ceremonies.
3.  Guru Nanak's teachings aimed to establish a new religion with distinct rituals and practices, unlike other Bhakti saints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ramananda, unlike what the statement suggests, was known for his inclusive approach, teaching his doctrine of Bhakti to all four varnas, disregarding traditional caste barriers.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir is well-known for his rejection of many traditional Hindu practices and his emphasis on a direct, personal relationship with God. His criticism of idol worship and ritualistic practices is a defining aspect of his philosophy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Guru Nanak, while having a unique impact, did not intend to found a new religion in the traditional sense. His aim was to promote religious harmony and a direct path to God, open to all, rather than establishing a separate religious structure with unique rituals and practices.  His teachings evolved into Sikhism over time, but this was not his initial intention.


**8. With reference to the Mughal conquest and consolidation of power, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquest of Chittor in 1568 was a swift and bloodless victory, achieved through diplomacy and negotiation rather than military force.
2. The conquest of Gujarat under Akbar involved significant resistance from the Mirzas, who had taken refuge there after rebelling against Akbar near Delhi.
3. Following the conquest of Bengal, the Mughal control over the region was immediately and completely established, with no further resistance or rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The siege of Chittor was a prolonged and bloody affair, resulting in a significant massacre of Rajput warriors and civilians.  This highlights the brutality often involved in Mughal conquests, contradicting the statement's description of a swift and bloodless victory.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mirzas' resistance in Gujarat is explicitly mentioned in the text, highlighting their role in prolonging the Mughal conquest of the region and the challenges faced by Akbar in consolidating his control.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mughal conquest of Bengal was followed by further resistance and rebellions, demonstrating that consolidating Mughal power was not a simple or immediate process, even after initial military victories.


**9. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah I of Bijapur was known for his persecution of Hindu religious figures and the suppression of Hindu religious practices.
2. Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur constructed the Gol Gumbaz.
3. The Dakhini Urdu form of Urdu developed and flourished in the Deccan region, drawing influences from Persian, Hindi, and Telugu languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ali Adil Shah I is described as tolerant and engaging in discussions with both Hindu and Muslim religious figures. He is even called a Sufi, which contradicts the statement's claim of persecution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gol Gumbaz was built later, during the reign of Muhammad Adil Shah, not Ibrahim Adil Shah II.  This requires careful attention to the chronology of events and rulers within the Bijapur Sultanate.

Statement 3 is correct. The development of Dakhini Urdu in the Deccan, incorporating influences from various languages, demonstrates the cultural interaction and exchange in the region.


**10. With reference to the reign of Aurangzeb and the challenges he faced, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's initial approach to the Maratha problem was a cautious one, focusing on diplomacy and limited military intervention.
2. Jai Singh I's Bijapur campaign in 1665 was a resounding success, significantly weakening the Bijapur Sultanate and paving the way for further Mughal conquests.
3. The execution of Sambhaji in 1689 ultimately strengthened the Maratha resistance and proved to be a strategic mistake for Aurangzeb.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb's initial approach might have involved elements of diplomacy, it's inaccurate to characterize it as solely cautious and limited.  The text shows a more active engagement, though ultimately unsuccessful.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jai Singh's Bijapur campaign in 1665 was a failure, resulting in no territorial gains and contributing to the strengthening of the Deccan sultanates' united front against the Mughals.

Statement 3 is correct. The execution of Sambhaji, a significant Maratha leader, eliminated a potential negotiating partner and galvanized Maratha resistance, proving to be a costly strategic error.


**1. With reference to the socio-economic conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently described a uniform standard of living across all social strata in medieval India, characterized by affluence and prosperity.
2.  The staple diet of the common people in North India primarily consisted of rice, millet, and pulses, supplemented by fish and meat depending on regional availability.
3.  The village artisan community, often comprising landless laborers and those belonging to marginalized castes, were particularly vulnerable to the devastating impact of frequent famines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. European accounts depicted a stark contrast between the wealth of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty of ordinary people, including peasants, artisans, and laborers.  Babur's observations about the scanty clothing of the common people, corroborated by other travelers like Ralph Fitch and De Laet, highlight this disparity. The accounts emphasize the grinding poverty faced by the majority of the population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice, millet, and pulses formed a significant part of the diet, the description varies regionally.  North India saw chapatis made of wheat or coarse grains, pulses, and green vegetables as common fare.  The inclusion of fish in Bengal and coastal areas and meat in the south shows regional variation, not a uniform national staple.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that landless peasants and laborers, often belonging to "untouchables" or "kamin" castes, suffered the most during famines. This highlights the vulnerability of the marginalized sections of village society to economic shocks.  This vulnerability stemmed from their lack of land ownership and dependence on others for livelihood. The khudkashts, owning the land they tilled, were comparatively better off.


**2. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility was primarily composed of individuals from Central Asian aristocratic families, reflecting a strictly enforced racial policy by the Mughal rulers.
2.  The Jagirdari system, while initially effective, faced a crisis characterized by a shortage of jagirs and the corruption of officials, leading to pressure on the nobility.
3.  Aurangzeb's policies, including a virtual ban on new recruitment and his handling of the Maratha issue, contributed significantly to the disintegration of the Mughal Empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many early Mughal nobles were from Central Asia, the Mughal rulers did not follow a narrow racist policy.  The text explicitly states that Babur tried to win over Afghan nobles, and later, more Afghans were recruited into the nobility.  The nobility was open to both Indians and foreigners, though aristocratic families had an advantage.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly describes a crisis in the Jagirdari system.  The shortage of jagirs, coupled with widespread corruption among officials who demanded bribes, put immense pressure on the Mughal nobility. The reduction in the number of horses and soldiers a mansabdar was expected to maintain, while intended to address the jagir shortage, did not fully resolve the underlying issue.

Statement 3 is correct. Aurangzeb's policies, including the virtual ban on new recruitment (creating discontent among aspiring nobles), and his flawed approach to the Maratha problem (failure to negotiate effectively and integrate them into the Mughal system), significantly contributed to the decline and eventual disintegration of the Mughal empire. His inability to understand the Maratha movement and his distrust of Maratha sardars are cited as key factors in this failure.


**3. With reference to the economic life during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The real wages of workers remained largely stagnant during the Mughal period, indicating a lack of improvement in their living standards, despite a more balanced diet.
2.  The Mughal state played a minimal role in the expansion and improvement of cultivation, relying primarily on local efforts and investments.
3.  The expansion of India's foreign trade during the 17th century was hindered by high taxes on goods, inadequate transportation, and unsafe trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Moreland's observation that real wages remained largely unchanged during the Mughal period, despite a more balanced diet, indicates overall stagnation of living standards for workers. The text highlights that while food might have been relatively accessible, the cost of other necessities like clothes and sugar increased, preventing significant improvement in living standards.  This is in contrast to the significant increase in wealth and real wages experienced in Europe during the same period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mughal state actively intervened to promote agricultural growth. The text mentions that the Mughal state provided incentives and loans (taccavi) to peasants to encourage expansion and improvements in cultivation.  While local efforts were vital, the Mughal state played a significant role in supporting agricultural development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that the Mughal rule fostered the expansion of trade. Political integration, improved infrastructure (roads and sarais), and a standardized currency (the silver rupee) contributed to the growth of commerce.  While some issues like road cesses might have existed locally, the overall environment under the Mughals was conducive to the expansion of trade, not hindered by it.


**4. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbaz, built in Bijapur, is renowned for its harmonious proportions, featuring a large dome balanced by short, squat minarets at the corners.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, known as "Friend of the Poor," is celebrated for his patronage of music and for composing the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas.
3.  The Charminar, constructed in Hyderabad by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, is characterized by its three lofty arches, facing the three principal directions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of the Gol Gumbaz is largely accurate, except for the minarets. The text states that the large dome is balanced by "tall, tapering minarets," not short and squat ones. This detail is crucial for an accurate description of the architectural marvel.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage correctly describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of music, his title of "Friend of the Poor," and his composition of the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas.  This accurately reflects his contributions to the cultural landscape of the Deccan.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Charminar is described as having "four lofty arches," not three, each facing a cardinal direction. This factual inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.  The description of the four minarets is accurate.


**5. With reference to the socio-religious aspects of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Smriti literature of the medieval period advocated for the equal division of paternal estate among sons, and the unrestricted inheritance of Stridhana by children.
2.  The practice of Purdah, the seclusion of women, spread widely among the upper classes during the medieval period, influenced by various social, religious, and historical factors.
3.  The Bhakti movement during the 16th and 17th centuries saw the emergence of the Sikh movement in Punjab and the Maharashtra Dharma in Maharashtra, both characterized by complete harmony with existing religious structures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Smriti literature did advocate for the equal division of paternal estate amongst sons, it did *not* advocate for unrestricted inheritance of Stridhana by children without the husband's permission.  The text explicitly states that Stridhana was not inherited by children without the husband's permission.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the spread of Purdah among upper-class women, attributing it to a combination of social, religious, and historical factors, including the fear of abduction by invaders and a desire to emulate the practices of the elite.  The text also provides a nuanced explanation of the practice's evolution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement did lead to the emergence of Sikhism in Punjab and the Maharashtra Dharma, it is inaccurate to describe their relationship with existing religious structures as one of complete harmony. Both movements, while drawing from existing religious traditions, also challenged and modified them in significant ways, leading to conflicts and tensions.  The Sikh gurus, for example, clashed with Mughal rulers on several occasions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced Persian literature for generations, while his brother, Faizi, oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  The Mughal court attracted numerous Persian poets and scholars from Iran, enriching the cultural landscape of India, but  Hindu contributions to Persian literature during this period were negligible.
3.  The production of Sanskrit works during the Mughal era was primarily concentrated in South and East India, with Banaras serving as a major center for scholarly activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the significant literary contributions of the Abul Fazl-Faizi brothers. Abul Fazl's prose style became a model for subsequent generations, and Faizi's role in the translation of the Mahabharata is well-documented.  This highlights the Mughal patronage of both Persian and the translation of Indian epics, showcasing a cultural synthesis.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Mughal court did attract many Persian scholars and poets, the text explicitly mentions that Hindus also contributed to the growth of Persian literature, contradicting the statement's assertion of negligible Hindu contributions. This underscores the importance of avoiding generalizations about cultural interactions.

Statement 3 correctly identifies the geographical distribution of Sanskrit scholarship during the Mughal period.  The concentration in South and East India, with Banaras as a prominent center, reflects the existing scholarly traditions and the continued patronage of Sanskrit learning by local rulers alongside Mughal support for translation projects. This emphasizes the complex interplay of regional and imperial patronage in shaping intellectual life.


**2. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of regional languages was solely due to the decline in the prestige of Sanskrit and the Brahmins.
2.  Bhakti saints played a crucial role in shaping and promoting regional languages for literary expression, particularly in Hindi, Bengali, Oriya, Rajasthani, and Gujarati.
3.  The translation of the Ramayana and Mahabharata into regional languages contributed significantly to their growth and standardization, although the translations were primarily done by Muslims.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While the decline of Brahminical dominance and Sanskrit's prestige might have been a contributing factor, it wasn't the sole reason for the rise of regional languages. Other factors, such as increased vernacular literacy, growing regional identities, and the patronage of rulers, also played significant roles. This highlights the need to consider multiple factors in historical analysis.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the substantial contribution of Bhakti saints. Their use of vernacular languages in religious poetry and hymns popularized these languages and established them as vehicles for literary expression. This demonstrates the social and religious factors influencing linguistic development.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the translation of epics did indeed contribute to the growth of regional languages, the assertion that the translations were *primarily* done by Muslims is inaccurate.  The text mentions contributions from both Hindus and Muslims, demonstrating a collaborative effort. This emphasizes the importance of nuanced historical understanding that avoids oversimplifying complex processes.


**3. With reference to the religious and cultural interactions during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh movement's development was closely linked to the institution of Guruship, with Guru Arjun completing the compilation of the Adi Granth, but the lifestyle of the Gurus was consistently austere and simple.
2.  Conflicts between the Sikh Gurus and Mughal rulers were primarily driven by religious differences, leading to systematic persecution of Sikhs and Hindus.
3.  Dara Shikoh's efforts to promote religious harmony included translating the Gita into Persian and highlighting the compatibility of the Vedas and the Quran, reflecting a liberal religious policy within the Mughal court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the development of the Sikh movement is indeed linked to Guruship and Guru Arjun's compilation of the Adi Granth, the description of the Guru's lifestyle as consistently austere is inaccurate. The text indicates that Guru Arjun adopted an aristocratic lifestyle, highlighting the complex interplay between religious and political power.  This shows the importance of considering the evolution of religious movements.

Statement 2 is entirely incorrect. The text explicitly refutes the claim of systematic persecution of Sikhs and Hindus and attributes conflicts between the Sikh Gurus and Mughal rulers to personal and political factors rather than primarily religious differences.  This points to the need for careful analysis of historical narratives and the avoidance of generalizations about religious conflict.

Statement 3 accurately describes Dara Shikoh's efforts to promote religious harmony. His translation of the Gita and his assertion of the compatibility of the Vedas and the Quran demonstrate his liberal religious views and his attempts at interfaith dialogue. This exemplifies the existence of intellectual and political figures who championed religious tolerance within the Mughal court.


**4. With reference to the political and cultural landscape of 15th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kingdom of Kashmir, known for its strong Saivism, remained largely isolated and inaccessible to outsiders until the Mongol invasion of 1320.
2.  Zain-ul-Abidin's reign in Kashmir was marked by religious tolerance, the restoration of Hindu temples, and the abolition of jizya, but he did not patronize Sanskrit scholarship or translation.
3.  The Rajput kingdoms made significant cultural contributions, developing distinct architectural styles, patronizing local languages, and sometimes engaging in the destruction of temples, showcasing a complex mix of tolerance and intolerance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the historical context of 15th-century Kashmir. The kingdom's relative isolation and the impact of the Mongol invasion are well-established historical facts.  This highlights the vulnerability of even relatively isolated regions to broader historical trends.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Zain-ul-Abidin's reign was indeed characterized by religious tolerance, temple restorations, and the abolition of jizya, the statement incorrectly claims he did *not* patronize Sanskrit scholarship or translation. The text explicitly mentions his patronage of Sanskrit scholars and the translation of works like the Mahabharata into Persian. This illustrates the importance of accurate factual recall in historical analysis.

Statement 3 correctly summarizes the cultural contributions and complexities of the Rajput kingdoms. Their unique architectural styles, patronage of local languages, and instances of temple destruction reflect the multifaceted nature of their rule, showing a mixture of cultural preservation and sometimes intolerant actions. This demonstrates the need for a nuanced understanding of historical power dynamics and cultural practices.


**5. With reference to the early Mughal expansion and consolidation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's early reign was marked by conflicts with the nobility, including the Uzbeks who held powerful positions in various regions, but these conflicts were primarily caused by religious differences between Sunni and Shia factions.
2. The conquest of Malwa under Akbar involved the defeat of Baz Bahadur, but the subsequent cruelty of Mughal officials led to a brief resurgence of Baz Bahadur's rule.
3.  The Battle of Panipat (1556) saw the defeat of Hemu, securing Akbar's claim to the Mughal throne, but the Mughal empire was immediately consolidated and stabilized after this victory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did face conflicts with the nobility, including the Uzbeks, the primary cause of these conflicts was not religious differences between Sunni and Shia factions. The text indicates that the conflicts stemmed from power struggles and the Uzbeks' defiance of the young ruler. This highlights the need to avoid simplistic explanations of complex political situations.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the events surrounding the conquest of Malwa. The defeat of Baz Bahadur and the subsequent actions of Mughal officials did indeed lead to a temporary resurgence of Baz Bahadur's power. This underscores the challenges faced even after initial military victories in consolidating control.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Battle of Panipat did secure Akbar's claim to the throne, but the statement incorrectly asserts that the Mughal empire was immediately consolidated and stabilized.  Akbar faced significant challenges and rebellions in the years following this victory, as detailed in the text. This demonstrates the prolonged process of consolidating power after a significant military victory.


These questions demonstrate the application of various cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, while also incorporating plausible distractors to increase difficulty and assess a deeper understanding of the subject matter.  They are designed to challenge candidates and test their ability to analyze and synthesize information from various sources.


**1. With reference to the Bhakti and Sufi movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu and his incarnations, Rama and Krishna, while the Sufi movement emphasized a direct, personal relationship with Allah.
2.  Both movements, despite their distinct theological roots, shared a common goal of transcending caste and religious barriers to achieve spiritual unity.
3.  The use of vernacular languages like Hindi in both Bhakti and Sufi devotional poetry facilitated the spread of their message among wider sections of the population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Bhakti and Sufi movements in medieval India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the central focus of each movement. The Bhakti movement, particularly the Vaishnava branch, centered on the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, Rama and Krishna, using devotional poetry and songs to express their love and devotion.  Sufism, on the other hand, emphasized a direct, personal, mystical union with Allah, often expressed through poetry and music.  Statement 2 highlights the shared humanistic ideals of both movements.  Both Bhakti saints and Sufi mystics challenged rigid social hierarchies and religious divisions, advocating for a more inclusive and egalitarian spiritual path accessible to all, irrespective of caste or creed.  This emphasis on love, devotion, and direct experience of the divine formed a common ground. Statement 3 correctly points out the crucial role of vernacular languages. The use of Hindi and other regional languages in devotional poetry was instrumental in spreading the message of both movements beyond the confines of Sanskrit and Persian, making it accessible to a wider, less elite audience, fostering greater social and religious harmony.  The use of vernacular languages was a key factor in the popularity and widespread influence of both movements.


**2. With reference to the contributions of Sanskrit literature during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The production of Sanskrit works in various fields like philosophy, poetry, drama, and medicine significantly increased during this period compared to the preceding era.
2.  Despite the rise of Persian as an administrative language, Sanskrit continued to be a prominent language of higher learning and scholarship, particularly in Hindu-ruled regions.
3.  The medieval period saw a decline in the number of specialized schools and academies dedicated to Sanskrit learning, as these institutions were largely affected by the spread of Islam.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Statement 1 highlights the flourishing of Sanskrit literature during the medieval period.  The period saw a prolific output of Sanskrit works across diverse fields, reflecting the continued intellectual vitality of the Sanskrit tradition.  This was not just a continuation but an expansion upon the previous period.  Statement 2 correctly observes that Sanskrit remained a significant language of learning and scholarship.  While Persian gained prominence as the language of administration under Muslim rule, Sanskrit continued to thrive in various regions, especially in those under Hindu patronage.  Specialized schools and academies continued to function, preserving and disseminating Sanskrit knowledge. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the specialized schools and academies continued to flourish, even benefiting from the introduction of paper for wider dissemination of texts.  The assertion of a decline is factually inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the impact of Persian literature and language on India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The introduction of Persian language and literature had minimal impact on the development of regional languages of India.
2.  Persian became the primary language of administration and diplomacy under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire, influencing the upper classes and their dependents.
3.  There was significant translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice-versa, facilitating cultural exchange and mutual understanding between Hindu and Muslim scholars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 correctly describe the influence of Persian. Statement 2 accurately reflects the widespread adoption of Persian. Persian became the dominant language of administration, diplomacy, and elite culture, profoundly impacting social structures and communication patterns across India.  This influence extended to the upper classes and their dependents, shaping literary and cultural expression. Statement 3 correctly points to the significant translation efforts.  The text mentions several instances of translation between Sanskrit and Persian, demonstrating a degree of cross-cultural interaction and intellectual exchange. This included translations of literary works, scientific texts, and religious treatises. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The rise of Persian did not hinder the development of regional languages; instead, it interacted with and influenced them, leading to the evolution of new literary forms and styles.  The text shows the flourishing of regional languages alongside Persian.


**4. With reference to the religious and social reform movements of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement was entirely confined to South India, with no significant influence on the religious landscape of North India.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while advocating for social reform, were primarily concerned with individual spiritual transformation rather than large-scale societal changes.
3.  The orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam actively resisted the liberal and syncretic ideas of the Bhakti and Sufi movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately capture aspects of the reform movements. Statement 2 correctly identifies the primary focus of Kabir and Nanak. While their teachings had broader social implications, their central concern was the individual's spiritual journey and liberation, achieved through devotion and the guidance of a guru.  They challenged social norms but didn't primarily focus on structural reform. Statement 3 highlights the resistance to reformist ideas.  The orthodox sections of both Hinduism and Islam actively opposed the liberal and syncretic messages of the Bhakti and Sufi movements, clinging to traditional beliefs and practices, fearing the disruption of established power structures. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bhakti movement had a profound impact on both North and South India, spreading its message of devotion and challenging the caste system.  The movement's influence extended widely across the subcontinent.


**5.  With reference to the political and administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sultan held supreme authority in the Delhi Sultanate, wielding both political and military power, and acting as the final court of appeal in legal matters.
2. The Iqta system, a land revenue system introduced by the Delhi Sultans, was based on the principle of granting land in exchange for military service.
3. The office of the Wazir, the chief minister, held immense power and influence, often surpassing that of the Sultan himself in terms of administrative control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately depict aspects of the Delhi Sultanate. Statement 1 correctly describes the Sultan's power. The Sultan was the apex of the political and military system, with ultimate authority in all matters of state. He also acted as the highest court of appeal, ensuring the maintenance of justice and order. Statement 2 accurately describes the Iqta system. The Iqta system was a crucial element of the Sultanate's administration, involving the assignment of land grants in return for military service. This system provided the Sultanate with a substantial military force, while also serving as a land revenue collection mechanism. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Wazir was a powerful figure, the Sultan retained ultimate authority, and the Wazir's influence never superseded that of the Sultan.  The Wazir's power was always subordinate to the Sultan's.


**6. With reference to the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Tughlaq implemented several humanitarian measures, such as establishing hospitals for the poor and providing dowries for poor women, but these were primarily targeted towards Muslims.
2. Despite his orthodox leanings, Firuz Shah Tughlaq initiated the translation of Hindu religious texts into Persian, demonstrating a degree of interest in Hindu culture and beliefs.
3.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq’s reign saw a significant increase in the power and influence of the Ulema (religious scholars), who dictated state policy and exerted considerable control over the Sultan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reign. Statement 1 correctly notes his humanitarian efforts. Firuz Shah Tughlaq implemented various welfare programs, but these initiatives largely benefited the Muslim population.  His actions, though benevolent, were still within the framework of his own community's needs. Statement 2 correctly highlights his interest in Hindu texts. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's commissioning of translations of Hindu texts into Persian shows his willingness to engage with Hindu culture and knowledge. This initiative, while limited in scope, reflected a pragmatic approach to governance. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Firuz Shah Tughlaq held orthodox views, the Ulema did not dictate state policy during his rule.  The Sultan maintained his authority and decision-making power.


**7. With reference to the various regional languages that flourished during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of regional languages was primarily a consequence of the decline in the prestige and usage of Sanskrit following the loss of power by Brahmins.
2. The Bhakti movement played a crucial role in the development and popularization of regional languages as a medium for religious expression and literature.
3. The patronage of Muslim rulers was essential for the development and growth of regional languages, as they actively promoted these languages in their courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly explain the rise of regional languages. Statement 1 correctly identifies one factor. The decline in Sanskrit's dominance, linked to the Brahmin's reduced influence, created space for regional languages to rise.  This was not the sole reason, but a contributing factor. Statement 2 highlights the Bhakti movement's role. The Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages in devotional literature significantly contributed to their standardization and popularity.  This greatly expanded their usage and literary output. Statement 3 is not entirely accurate. While some Muslim rulers did patronize regional languages, it was not a universal phenomenon.  The development of regional languages was a complex process involving various social, cultural, and political factors.


**8. With reference to the development of music during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical instruments, modes, and regulations, leading to a significant exchange and fusion of musical traditions.
2.  The Sufi saints played a significant role in popularizing music as a form of religious expression, often incorporating Hindi verses into their musical recitations.
3.  Aurangzeb, despite his orthodox religious views, completely banned all forms of music in his court and suppressed the development of Indian classical music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the development of music. Statement 1 is accurate. The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical elements which interacted with existing Indian traditions, creating a rich fusion of styles and techniques.  This cultural exchange enriched the musical landscape. Statement 2 is accurate. Sufi saints played a vital role in integrating music into religious practice, using it as a means to express devotion and connect with the divine. Their use of Hindi made it accessible to a wider audience. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb was known for his orthodox views and may have discouraged certain aspects of courtly music, he did not completely ban it.  Music continued to thrive in various settings, including within the royal household itself.


**9. With reference to the Sikh movement in the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. Guru Arjun Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, completed the compilation of the Adi Granth, the Sikh scriptures, and adopted a more aristocratic lifestyle to enhance the movement's influence.
2. Guru Har Govind, the sixth Sikh Guru, maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal emperors and avoided any confrontation or conflict.
3. Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru, was executed by Aurangzeb primarily due to his political activities and association with rebels, rather than solely for religious reasons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe aspects of the Sikh movement. Statement 1 accurately portrays Guru Arjun Dev’s actions. Guru Arjun Dev compiled the Adi Granth and adopted a more prominent lifestyle to enhance the movement's profile and appeal. This strategy aimed to increase the movement's visibility and influence. Statement 3 accurately describes the reasons behind Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution. While religious factors played a role, his execution was also linked to his political activities, perceived opposition to Aurangzeb's policies, and the concerns of maintaining law and order.  The reasons were complex and multifaceted. Statement 2 is incorrect. Guru Har Govind did experience conflict with Mughal rulers, primarily due to political issues and territorial disputes.  His relationship with the Mughals was not consistently peaceful.


**10. With reference to the Rajput interactions with the Mughal Empire during the reign of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb initially valued the Rajput alliance and maintained cordial relations with leading Rajput houses, such as Mewar and Marwar.
2. The death of Raja Jaswant Singh of Marwar without a male heir led to a succession crisis, resulting in the state being brought under Mughal administration.
3. Aurangzeb's policies towards the Rajputs were consistently tolerant and conciliatory, leading to peaceful coexistence and continued alliances throughout his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Aurangzeb's Rajput policy. Statement 1 accurately portrays the initial phase.  Aurangzeb initially sought to maintain alliances with powerful Rajput houses, recognizing their strategic importance and military capabilities.  This reflected a pragmatic approach to consolidate his empire. Statement 2 correctly identifies the consequences of Jaswant Singh's death. Jaswant Singh's death without a male heir triggered a succession dispute, leading to the Mughal administration taking control of Marwar, a significant event in Rajput-Mughal relations. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Aurangzeb's policies towards the Rajputs were not consistently tolerant. While he initially sought alliances, tensions increased over time, leading to conflicts and challenges to Mughal authority.  His policies were more complex and less consistent than the statement suggests.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the development of regional languages in medieval India:**

1.  The rise of regional languages as literary mediums was partly due to the decline in Sanskrit's prestige, influenced by the diminishing influence of Brahmins.
2.  The Bhakti movement played a significant role in the development and use of regional languages for literary purposes, with many saints utilizing vernacular languages.
3.  Prior to the Turkish conquest, several pre-Turkish regional kingdoms already employed regional languages alongside Sanskrit for administrative purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of regional language development in medieval India. The decline of Brahminical influence and Sanskrit's prestige created a space for vernacular languages to flourish.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on reaching a wider audience, actively promoted the use of regional languages in religious literature and poetry.  Furthermore, historical evidence suggests that several pre-Turkish kingdoms in India already utilized regional languages for administrative purposes, indicating a pre-existing foundation for their later prominence.  The assertion that only one or two statements are correct is therefore inaccurate.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 3 is factually supported by historical evidence of the use of regional languages in administration before the arrival of the Turks.  The combined effect of these factors contributed significantly to the maturation of regional languages and their widespread adoption for literary expression in the medieval period.


**2. With reference to the integration of musical traditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical instruments like the rabab and sarangi, along with Persian musical modes and regulations, significantly influencing Indian classical music.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure, is credited with introducing several Perso-Arabic ragas and is also attributed, though without conclusive evidence, with the invention of the sitar.
3. The tabla, often attributed to Amir Khusrau, actually emerged during the late 17th or early 18th century, significantly later than his lifetime.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are historically accurate. The Turkic influence on Indian music, introducing new instruments and musical modes, is well-documented.  The later emergence of the tabla in the 17th-18th century also contradicts the commonly held but incorrect association with Amir Khusrau. However, statement 2, while partially true (Khusrau did introduce Perso-Arabic ragas), is misleading in its attribution of the sitar's invention to him.  There's no definitive historical evidence supporting this claim. The question tests the candidate’s ability to discern between established facts and commonly held but unsubstantiated beliefs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy or incompleteness of their respective statement combinations.  Understanding the nuances of historical attributions is crucial for accurate analysis in this area.


**3. With reference to the political and cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Timur's empire, at its zenith, extended from the lower Volga to the Indus River, encompassing significant parts of modern-day Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and a portion of the Punjab.
2.  After Timur's death, his grandson Shahrukh Mirza maintained a large portion of the empire, fostering arts and letters, with Samarqand and Herat becoming major cultural centers.
3.  The decline of the Timurids in the latter half of the 15th century was primarily due to internal conflicts stemming from their tradition of partitioning the empire amongst various princes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Timurid empire and its subsequent decline. Timur's vast empire, extending across Central Asia and into parts of India, is a well-established historical fact.  Shahrukh Mirza's patronage of arts and culture, leading to the flourishing of Samarqand and Herat, is also well-documented.  Finally, the fragmentation of the Timurid empire due to the practice of dividing territories among princes is a key factor in explaining its weakening and eventual collapse, opening the way for the rise of new powers like the Uzbeks and Safavids.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) which exclude one or more of these accurate statements are incorrect.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the broader political and cultural context of the Timurid period and its significance in shaping subsequent events.


**4. Consider the following statements about the early stages of the Turkish conquest of North India:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of North India began with the conquest of Multan and Uchch in 1173, followed by an unsuccessful attempt to penetrate Gujarat in 1178.
2.  The first battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a decisive victory for Prithviraj Chauhan, who subsequently captured Tabarhinda after a prolonged siege.
3.  The second battle of Tarain (1192) marked a turning point, with Muizzuddin Muhammad's victory leading to the establishment of Turkish rule in Delhi and the expansion into the Gangetic Doab.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe key events in the early Ghurid conquests.  Muizzuddin Muhammad's initial conquests in Sindh and Punjab, followed by his failed Gujarat campaign, are historically accurate.  The second battle of Tarain was indeed a pivotal moment, leading to the establishment of Turkish power in Delhi and the subsequent expansion into the Gangetic plains.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The first battle of Tarain resulted in a Ghurid defeat, not a victory for Prithviraj Chauhan.  This error serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of historical events. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inclusion of the factually inaccurate statement 2. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the sequence of events and the significance of major battles in shaping the early stages of Turkish rule in India.


**5. With reference to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, emphasized the worship of Rama and extended his teachings to all four varnas, disregarding traditional caste restrictions on social interaction.
2.  Kabir, a weaver by trade, is known for his emphasis on the unity of God, his rejection of idol worship and formal religious practices, and his denouncement of the caste system.
3.  Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism, while emphasizing monotheism and rejecting idol worship, focused on the importance of pure conduct and the guidance of a guru for attaining salvation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the teachings and impact of key figures in the Bhakti movement. Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, transcending caste barriers, is well-documented.  Kabir's syncretic philosophy, rejecting ritualistic practices and advocating for social equality, is another defining characteristic of the movement.  Finally, Guru Nanak's emphasis on monotheism, ethical conduct, and the role of the guru in spiritual guidance aligns with the broader themes of the Bhakti movement, even though Sikhism later developed as a distinct religion. Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incomplete and incorrect representations of the movement's key figures and their contributions. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the diverse expressions and social impact of the Bhakti movement.


**6. With reference to the economic and social conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers often described a stark contrast between the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among the common people, particularly peasants, artisans, and laborers.
2.  The staple diet of the common people primarily consisted of rice, millet, pulses, and in some regions, fish and meat, while clothing was often scarce and footwear was relatively expensive.
3.  Village society exhibited significant inequality, with landowning peasants (khudkashts) often belonging to dominant castes who exploited landless laborers and artisans, who in turn faced further exploitation by zamindars.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately depict various aspects of the economic and social fabric of medieval India.  Accounts from European travelers consistently highlight the vast disparity in living standards between the elite and the masses. The dietary habits and clothing conditions of the common people are also well-documented.  The deeply entrenched social hierarchy in villages, with its inherent inequalities and exploitative relationships, is a further key element of the social structure.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) which omit one or more of these accurate statements are incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's comprehension of the socio-economic realities of the period and their understanding of the complex power dynamics within village communities.


**7. With reference to India's overseas trade in the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance internal trade in North India is associated with a decrease in the influence of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs), leading to some guilds evolving into sub-castes.
2.  Despite some religious restrictions on travel, Indian merchants, scholars, and craftsmen actively engaged in trade and cultural exchange with West Asia and Southeast Asia.
3.  India's extensive overseas trade network, particularly with Southeast Asia and China, involved significant participation from South India, Bengal, and Gujarat, contributing to their economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe facets of India's medieval overseas trade. The correlation between the decline in internal trade, the weakening of guilds, and the transformation of some guilds into sub-castes is a valid observation.  Despite potential religious restrictions, the reality was active participation in overseas trade and cultural exchange with various regions.  Finally, the significant contributions of South India, Bengal, and Gujarat to the overseas trade network and their resulting economic prosperity are well-documented.  Options (a), (b), and (d), therefore, fail to encompass the complete picture. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the dynamics of internal and external trade, the resilience of mercantile activities despite social restrictions, and the regional variations in economic participation.



**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages as literary mediums was partly due to the decline in the prestige of Sanskrit and the Brahmins.
2.  Amir Khusrau, writing in the early fourteenth century, observed that regional languages were already used for common purposes.
3.  The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to the development and standardization of several regional languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the development of regional languages in medieval India.  The decline in Brahminical prestige and the subsequent reduced emphasis on Sanskrit created space for vernacular languages to flourish.  Amir Khusrau's observation underscores the pre-existing presence and usage of these languages, even if their literary development was still in its nascent stages.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on reaching a wider audience through accessible language, provided a powerful catalyst for the growth and standardization of Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, and other regional languages.  The saints' use of vernaculars for religious poetry and prose made these languages vehicles for literature, significantly boosting their prestige and development.  Therefore, all three statements accurately capture different facets of this complex historical process.


**2. With reference to the patronage of arts and literature in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara rulers primarily patronized Telugu literature, while Marathi flourished under the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.
2.  Nusrat Shah of Bengal commissioned translations of the Mahabharata and Bhagavata into Bengali.
3.  The Mughal emperors primarily supported Persian literature, neglecting the development of regional languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Vijayanagara empire, known for its extensive patronage of the arts, indeed saw significant growth in Telugu literature.  Simultaneously, Marathi literature thrived under the patronage of the Deccan Sultanates, notably the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms. Statement 2 is also correct. Nusrat Shah's patronage of Bengali literature is well-documented, including his commissioning of translations of major Sanskrit epics.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mughal emperors did patronize Persian literature extensively, their patronage wasn't exclusively limited to it.  Several regional languages also saw growth under their rule, albeit perhaps to a lesser extent compared to Persian.  The development of medieval Hindi, for instance, received considerable support from both Mughal and Hindu rulers.  The support extended to various regional languages wasn't negligible, demonstrating a more nuanced approach than the statement suggests.


**3. With reference to the Sufi influence on medieval Indian culture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi, a Sufi saint from Jaunpur, wrote in Hindi, making Sufi concepts accessible to a wider audience.
2.  The Kashf-ul-Mahjub, a significant Sufi work, was authored by Moinuddin Chishti.
3.  Sufi saints' use of Bhakti poetry in Hindi during musical gatherings helped popularize Persian literary forms like the masnavi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi's use of Hindi in his Sufi writings is well-established, reflecting a conscious effort to disseminate Sufi ideas beyond a primarily Persian-speaking elite. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kashf-ul-Mahjub was authored by Abul Hasan al-Hujwiri, not Moinuddin Chishti.  Statement 3 is correct.  Sufi saints' engagement with Bhakti poetry in Hindi, often within musical gatherings (sama), did indeed contribute to the popularity of Persian literary forms like the masnavi among a wider Indian audience.  The blending of Sufi and Bhakti traditions is a significant aspect of medieval Indian cultural history.  The use of accessible vernaculars alongside Persian forms showcases the cultural synthesis of the period.


**4. With reference to the musical traditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau is credited with inventing the sitar, although there's no conclusive evidence to support this claim.
2.  The Ragadarpan, a classical Indian work on music, was translated into Persian during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq.
3.  Aurangzeb's reign saw a complete suppression of music, reflecting his strict orthodox religious views.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Amir Khusrau is often associated with the sitar's invention, but historical evidence remains inconclusive.  Statement 2 is also correct. The translation of the Ragadarpan into Persian during Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reign indicates the continued interaction and exchange between Indian and Persian musical traditions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's personal preference leaned towards a more orthodox interpretation of Islam,  leading him to ban singing in his court,  the complete suppression of music is an overstatement.  Musical traditions continued, albeit with some restrictions, particularly within the royal harem and among the nobility. The claim of complete suppression overlooks the continued patronage by other members of the Mughal court and the broader persistence of musical practices throughout society.


**5. With reference to religious and social movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, disregarded caste restrictions in his teachings and discipleship.
2.  Kabir strongly criticized idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices of both Hinduism and Islam.
3.  Guru Nanak's teachings primarily aimed at establishing a new religion, Sikhism, distinct from Hinduism and Islam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, transcending caste barriers in his teachings and acceptance of disciples, is a well-documented aspect of the Bhakti movement. Statement 2 is also correct. Kabir's critique of ritualistic aspects of both Hinduism and Islam, emphasizing a direct path to God, is a central theme in his philosophy.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Guru Nanak's teachings eventually led to the formation of Sikhism, his initial aim wasn't to found a separate religion. His focus was on promoting a syncretic approach, seeking unity between Hindus and Muslims, rather than establishing a new distinct faith. His emphasis on monotheism and rejection of ritualistic practices were aimed at fostering religious harmony and a more inclusive spiritual path.  The evolution of Sikhism as a distinct religion came later,  building upon Guru Nanak's initial message but developing its own unique identity over time.


**6. With reference to the political and military conflicts of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of Delhi marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Battle of Chandawar, fought between Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghori and Jaichandra, resulted in the conquest of the powerful Gahadavala kingdom.
3.  Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at the second Battle of Tarain was primarily due to his superior numerical strength but poor military strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ghurid victory at Tarain and subsequent conquests laid the foundation for the Delhi Sultanate, ushering in a new era in Indian political history. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Battle of Chandawar indeed led to the defeat and death of Jaichandra, resulting in the conquest of the Gahadavala kingdom.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at Tarain wasn't due to superior numerical strength. Although the Indian army might have been larger, the Ghurid army's superior organization, tactics, and leadership proved decisive.  The claim that he possessed superior numbers but lacked strategy is inaccurate. The Ghurids possessed better-organized cavalry and superior military tactics, which ultimately determined the outcome of the battle.


**7. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah of Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah annexed Kamata (Kamrup) to Bengal after a military campaign supported by the Ahoms.
3.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's policy was characterized by religious intolerance and the persecution of Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is indeed noted for the flourishing of Bengali literature and the patronage extended to Bengali writers. Statement 2 is also correct.  His conquest of Kamata, achieved with Ahom support, expanded the territory under Bengal's control.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's policy was not characterized by religious intolerance. Instead, his reign is known for its relatively liberal policies, including the appointment of Hindus to high offices.  His administration included Hindus in key positions, demonstrating a more inclusive approach than suggested by the statement.  The statement misrepresents the inclusive nature of his rule.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the empire's greatest territorial extent, stretching from the Krishna River to the Tungabhadra River.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers maintained a powerful navy, enabling them to extract tribute from various maritime powers.
3.  Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq, foreign travelers, provided detailed accounts of Vijayanagara's wealth and splendor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Deva Raya II's reign was a period of prosperity and expansion, the empire's greatest territorial extent wasn't limited to the area between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers. The empire's reach extended far beyond this region. Statement 2 is partially correct. While the Vijayanagara empire had a significant naval presence, the claim of extracting regular tribute from all mentioned maritime powers is exaggerated.  The empire's influence extended to the coast, but the extent of its control over maritime trade and tribute varied. Statement 3 is correct.  Both Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq left detailed accounts of the empire's wealth, size, and splendor, providing valuable insights for historians. Their observations confirm the empire's significant economic and political power.


**9. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom in the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign saw a significant increase in the participation of Hindus in the administration.
2.  Mahmud Gawan, the prime minister, led military campaigns that significantly expanded the Bahmani kingdom's territory, including the conquest of Goa.
3.  The Bahmani kingdom's conflicts were primarily driven by religious differences with neighboring Hindu kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign is known for its relatively inclusive policies, including the increased involvement of Hindus in administrative positions. Statement 2 is also correct. Mahmud Gawan's leadership resulted in territorial expansion, with significant gains, including the conquest of coastal areas like Goa. Statement 3 is incorrect. While religious factors played a role in some conflicts, the Bahmani kingdom's wars were primarily driven by political and strategic considerations, such as control over trade routes and territorial dominance, rather than solely religious differences.  The conflicts were more complex than simply religious divides; political ambitions and economic factors were equally, if not more, significant drivers.


**10.  With reference to the social and religious climate of 15th-16th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement's emphasis on love and devotion softened the rigidity of the caste system but did not completely dismantle it.
2.  The Sufi concept of *tawhid-i-wahdat* (Unity of Being), influenced by Ibn Arabi, found significant acceptance in India and contributed to interfaith dialogue.
3.  The orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam fully embraced the liberal religious and social reforms advocated by the Bhakti and Sufi movements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement, while promoting inclusivity and devotion, did not abolish the caste system. Its influence softened the rigidity of the system to some extent, but it remained a persistent feature of Indian society. Statement 2 is also correct. The Sufi concept of *tawhid-i-wahdat*, emphasizing the unity of being, gained traction in India and contributed to intellectual and spiritual exchange between different religious communities.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The orthodox factions within both Hinduism and Islam resisted the liberalizing influences of the Bhakti and Sufi movements, leading to ongoing tensions and conflicts between these opposing forces.  The statement ignores the significant opposition from orthodox groups who actively resisted these liberalizing trends.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Namadeva, a tailor-turned-saint, is known for his Marathi poetry expressing intense devotion to God and his interactions with Sufi saints in Delhi.
2. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, preached Bhakti to all four varnas, disregarding caste restrictions on communal dining.
3. Kabir, a weaver by caste, and Ravidas, a cobbler, were prominent disciples of Ramananda, while Sena and Sadhana were disciples of Namadeva.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Namadeva's background, poetic contributions, and interactions with Sufi saints, reflecting the syncretic nature of the Bhakti movement. Statement 2 correctly highlights Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, transcending traditional caste barriers.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Kabir and Ravidas were indeed disciples of Ramananda, Sena and Sadhana were not disciples of Namadeva.  The text explicitly links Kabir and Ravidas to Ramananda and doesn't mention disciples for Namadeva.  The inclusion of Sena and Sadhana as Namadeva's disciples is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of information.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading details.


**2. With reference to the social and religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of Rajput rulers and the rise of the Turkish Sultanate weakened the Brahmanical order, fostering movements like the Nath Panthi that challenged the caste system.
2. Sufi ideals of equality and brotherhood, coinciding with the Bhakti movement's emphasis on devotion, contributed to a climate of religious reform and social change.
3. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu and Shiva, neglecting the devotional practices centered around other deities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the socio-political context that facilitated the rise of reformist movements challenging the existing Brahmanical hierarchy. The weakening of Rajput power created a vacuum, allowing alternative religious and social ideologies to gain traction. Statement 2 accurately captures the confluence of Sufi and Bhakti ideals in promoting religious tolerance and social reform, emphasizing a shift from ritualistic practices towards emotional and rational faith. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Bhakti movement had strong Vaishnava and Shaiva streams, it wasn't limited to these deities.  The movement encompassed a wide range of devotional practices and deities, including those of local and tribal origins. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the broader historical context and the nuances of religious movements.


**3. With reference to the contributions of Kabir and Nanak, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir, believed to have been raised by a Muslim weaver, emphasized the unity of God (Allah, Sain, Sahib, etc.), denouncing idol worship and pilgrimages.
2. Nanak, born into a Khatri family, undertook extensive travels across India and beyond, spreading his message of monotheism and emphasizing the importance of a guru for guidance.
3. Both Kabir and Nanak actively sought to establish new religions, leading to the formalization of distinct religious traditions, Kabir Panthis and Sikhism, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the lives and teachings of Kabir and Nanak.  Kabir's syncretic approach to spirituality, his rejection of ritualistic Hinduism and Islam, and his humble origins are well-documented. Similarly, Nanak's travels, his monotheistic message, and his emphasis on the role of a guru are central to Sikhism's origins. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Nanak's teachings eventually led to the formation of Sikhism, neither he nor Kabir intended to found new religions.  Their primary aim was to promote religious harmony and social reform within the existing framework. The transformation of their followers into distinct religious sects happened after their deaths. The question tests detailed knowledge of these significant figures and their impact on Indian religious history.


**4. With reference to the Vaishavite movement and its prominent figures, consider the following statements:**

1. The saint-poets of the Vaishavite movement, active during the 15th and 16th centuries, used the Radha-Krishna relationship allegorically to express the bond between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul.
2. Chaitanya, known for popularizing the Kirtan, emphasized love, devotion, song, and dance as forms of worship accessible to all, irrespective of caste.
3. Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, and Surdas were contemporaries of Chaitanya, all active in Bengal and Orissa, contributing to the lyrical fervor of the Vaishavite movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the allegorical use of the Radha-Krishna love story by Vaishavite saint-poets to convey spiritual truths.  Statement 2 correctly highlights Chaitanya's contribution to the movement through the popularization of Kirtan and his inclusive approach to worship.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, and Surdas were indeed prominent Vaishavite figures, they were not contemporaries of Chaitanya, nor were they all active in Bengal and Orissa.  Their geographical locations and periods of activity differed significantly.  This statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific individuals and their temporal and geographical context.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information regarding prominent figures in a significant religious movement.


**5. With reference to the literary and artistic developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajput rulers patronized Sanskrit literature, with Ujjain and Dhara serving as significant centers of Sanskrit learning.
2. Hemachandra, a prominent Jain scholar, made significant contributions to Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature, while the rise of Brahmanism led to Sanskrit's dominance over Apabhramsha and Prakrit.
3. The modern North Indian languages, such as Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi, emerged directly from Sanskrit during this period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, reflecting the patronage of Sanskrit scholarship by Rajput rulers and the importance of Ujjain and Dhara as centers of learning. Statement 2 correctly identifies Hemachandra's contributions and the shift in linguistic dominance towards Sanskrit due to the revival of Brahmanism.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While the modern North Indian languages evolved during this period, their origins are not directly from Sanskrit but from Apabhramsha and Prakrit, which were themselves evolving from earlier vernaculars.  This statement is a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the complex linguistic evolution of the region.  The question tests knowledge of the interplay between political patronage, linguistic developments, and religious influence on literature.


**6. With reference to the Turkish conquest of North India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest, starting with Shahabuddin Muhammad's reign, initially focused on establishing a base in Punjab before advancing towards Delhi.
2. The first battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a decisive victory for the Ghurids, leading to the immediate conquest of Delhi and the Gangetic doab.
3. Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at the second battle of Tarain (1192) marked a significant turning point, leading to the establishment of Turkish rule in North India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Ghurid strategy of consolidating their position in Punjab before launching a major offensive into the Gangetic plains. Statement 3 correctly identifies the second battle of Tarain as a pivotal moment that paved the way for Turkish dominance in North India. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. The first battle of Tarain resulted in a victory for Prithviraj Chauhan, not the Ghurids. The Ghurids' conquest of Delhi and the Gangetic doab happened after their victory in the second battle.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the sequence of events and the strategic context of the Turkish conquest.



**7. With reference to the cultural interaction between Hindus and Muslims during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a notable figure, introduced several Perso-Arabic musical airs (ragas) and is often credited with inventing the sitar, although evidence is lacking.
2.  The integration of Persian and Indian musical traditions continued under rulers like Firuz Shah Tughlaq, who patronized music and translated the Ragadarpan into Persian.
3.  The Mughal rulers, particularly Aurangzeb, actively suppressed all forms of music, leading to a decline in musical development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Amir Khusrau's contribution to the fusion of musical traditions and the lack of definitive evidence for his invention of the sitar. Statement 2 correctly highlights the continuation of this musical synthesis under Firuz Shah Tughlaq's patronage. However, Statement 3 is inaccurate. While Aurangzeb is known for his personal religious conservatism, he did not completely suppress music. While he may have discouraged public musical performances in his court, musical traditions continued to thrive under the patronage of other members of the Mughal court and in various regions of the empire.  The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to avoid generalizations based on limited information.


**8. With reference to the religious movements and intellectual currents of the 16th and 17th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sikh movement, originating with Nanak's teachings, saw the Adi Granth compiled under Guru Arjun Dev, who also adopted a more aristocratic lifestyle.
2.  Guru Har Gobind's conflicts with the Mughal emperors primarily stemmed from religious differences and the emperors' attempts to suppress Sikhism.
3.  Dadu's non-sectarian philosophy, rejecting both Hindu and Muslim scriptures, emphasized the indivisibility of Brahma or the Supreme Reality.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the compilation of the Adi Granth and Guru Arjun Dev's shift towards a more prominent public role. Statement 3 correctly reflects Dadu's non-sectarian philosophy and his rejection of established religious texts.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While Guru Har Gobind did have conflicts with the Mughal rulers, these conflicts were not primarily driven by religious differences but involved political factors and personal disputes.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Sikh movement and the nuances of religious movements in the period.


**9. With reference to the reign of Akbar and its impact on religious and cultural interactions, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's concept of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) aimed to promote religious harmony and tolerance, encompassing various faiths and beliefs.
2. Abul Fazl, Akbar's court historian and scholar, played a crucial role in promoting cultural exchange and the translation of religious texts into Persian.
3. The orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam wholeheartedly embraced Akbar's religious policies and actively participated in his efforts to foster religious unity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes Akbar's *sulh-i-kul* policy and its objective of religious harmony. Statement 2 accurately highlights Abul Fazl's significant contributions to Akbar's cultural initiatives and translation projects. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. Akbar's religious policies faced considerable opposition from orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam, who resisted his efforts to synthesize religious beliefs and challenge traditional religious hierarchies.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of Akbar's religious policy, its objectives, and the challenges it faced.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its interactions with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I successfully regained territories lost to the Bahmani Sultanate south of the Krishna River through military victories.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire maintained extensive maritime contacts and received tribute from various kingdoms in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while Deva Raya I attempted to recover lost territories, he did not achieve complete success through military victories, ultimately agreeing to existing frontiers. Statement 3 is also incorrect. While the Bahmani kingdom and Vijayanagara were engaged in conflicts, the Bahmani kingdom did not consistently achieve military dominance, and territorial gains were often temporary. Statement 2 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire's maritime prowess and extensive trade networks are well-documented, indicating contacts with various kingdoms in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.  The question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements regarding military conflicts and diplomatic relations.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is intended to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1. With reference to the Rajput period in Indian history, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chauhan rulers, primarily based in Ajmer, successfully repelled all Turkish incursions into Rajasthan.
2.  The Paramara rulers of Malwa, known for their patronage of learning, established Ujjain as a significant center for Sanskrit studies.
3.  Hemachandra, a prominent Jain scholar, made significant contributions to literature in both Sanskrit and Apabhramsha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chauhans offered spirited resistance to Turkish raids, they did not entirely succeed in repelling all incursions.  The text highlights both Rajput victories and eventual Turkish successes, indicating a complex and fluctuating power dynamic. The question attempts to mislead the candidate by focusing on a single aspect of a more nuanced historical reality.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Ujjain and Dhara, the capitals of the Paramara rulers, as renowned centers for Sanskrit learning, reflecting their significant cultural patronage.

Statement 3 is correct. Hemachandra's contributions to Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature are directly stated in the text, highlighting his importance in the context of the linguistic landscape of the period.  This is a factual detail requiring specific recall.


**2. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in North India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of North India began with the capture of Delhi in 1173.
2. The Battle of Tarain (1192) marked the decisive turning point in establishing Turkish rule in North India, leading to the eventual decline of the Chauhan power.
3.  The Gahadavala kingdom of Kanauj offered strong and sustained resistance to the Ghurid advance, ultimately delaying the consolidation of Turkish rule in the Ganga-Yamuna doab for several decades.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly indicates that the Ghurid conquest began with the capture of Multan and Uchch in 1173, not Delhi. Delhi's conquest came later. The question uses a chronologically incorrect detail as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Tarain (1192) is explicitly identified as a pivotal moment in Indian history, marking a significant shift in power dynamics and paving the way for the establishment of Turkish rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Jaichandra of Kanauj did fight the Ghurids, the text suggests his resistance was not sustained or ultimately successful in preventing the Turkish expansion into the Ganga-Yamuna doab. The battle of Chandawar led to his defeat and death, enabling further Turkish advances.  The question plays on the candidate's potential to overestimate the Gahadavala resistance.


**3. With reference to the cultural interactions during the Sultanate period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultans primarily patronized Arabic, neglecting the development of Persian and other regional languages.
2.  Amir Khusrau's writings significantly contributed to the development and prominence of regional languages in India.
3.  The Sufi saints played a crucial role in the popularization of Hindi literature, often incorporating Sufi concepts into their works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Delhi Sultans, particularly, actively promoted Persian as an administrative and court language, alongside Arabic.  The statement incorrectly claims a singular focus on Arabic, ignoring the significant role of Persian.

Statement 2 is partially correct but nuanced. Amir Khusrau did write in Persian, but his contribution to the rise of regional languages is not explicitly highlighted in the given text.  The text focuses more on the broader trends of regional language development during the Sultanate period.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between direct and indirect influence.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Sufi saints' contribution to the popularization of Hindi literature, using it to convey Sufi ideas in an accessible manner to the common people.  This is a specific fact requiring direct recall.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire maintained a consistently strong naval presence, allowing it to exert control over the Indian Ocean trade routes and extract tribute from distant kingdoms.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked a high point in Telugu literature, with a shift away from mere imitation of Sanskrit works towards independent literary creations.
3.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) is generally considered a watershed moment, marking the definitive end of the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire was powerful, the text suggests its naval power was not consistently strong enough to control the Indian Ocean routes as effectively as some previous empires. The question uses an overstated claim about naval dominance to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions Krishna Deva Raya's patronage of Telugu literature and the shift towards independent works, highlighting a significant cultural development during his reign.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While the Battle of Talikota was a devastating defeat, the empire technically lingered for about a century after. The question highlights the ambiguity surrounding the "end" of an empire, testing the candidate's understanding of historical nuance.  The text explicitly states that the empire continued for almost a hundred years after Talikota, though considerably weakened.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire's relationship with Rajput states, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy was solely based on matrimonial alliances, with no other diplomatic or administrative strategies employed.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati (1576) resulted in the immediate and unconditional surrender of Rana Pratap of Mewar to the Mughal Empire.
3.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax demonstrated a policy of broad religious toleration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar’s Rajput policy was multifaceted, encompassing matrimonial alliances, strategic appointments, and religious tolerance to consolidate his power and integrate Rajput elites into his administration.  The statement simplifies a complex historical strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Battle of Haldighati was a significant engagement, but it did not lead to Rana Pratap's immediate surrender. He continued his resistance through guerrilla warfare.  The question uses the outcome of the battle as a major distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The abolition of the jizya tax is explicitly mentioned in the text as a demonstration of Akbar's religious tolerance.  This is a clearly stated fact requiring direct recall.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the historical context and the ability to analyze subtle details within the text. They incorporate plausible distractors and test the candidate's capacity for critical evaluation of historical information.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length constraints and the richness of the provided text, it's impossible to cover every single detail in a limited set of MCQs.  The selection prioritizes key concepts and nuanced information suitable for a high-level exam like the UPSC.


**1. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced Persian literary traditions in India for several generations.
2.  Faizi, Abul Fazl's brother, oversaw the translation of the Ramayana into Persian during Akbar's reign.
3.  The migration of Persian poets and scholars to India enriched the Mughal court's cultural landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Abul Fazl's prose style is acknowledged as a significant influence on subsequent Persian prose writing in India.  His work set a standard emulated for generations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Faizi was involved in Akbar's translation department and played a role in translating works, the passage specifies that it was the *Mahabharata*, not the *Ramayana*, that was translated under his supervision.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates the correct from the incorrect answer, demanding precise factual recall.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the migration of numerous Persian poets and scholars to India during the Mughal period, significantly impacting the cultural landscape of the Mughal court, transforming it into a major center of Islamic culture. The inclusion of this statement serves as a distractor, as it is true but requires deeper understanding of the passage's implications beyond a superficial reading.


**2. With reference to the religious and cultural interactions during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement's influence waned during the 16th and 17th centuries, overshadowed by the rise of Sikhism.
2.  Guru Arjun Dev's aristocratic lifestyle and the collection of offerings from Sikhs contributed to the growth of the Sikh movement.
3.  Dara Shikoh's translation of the Gita into Persian reflected his belief in the fundamental compatibility of Hinduism and Islam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Bhakti movement *continued* apace during the 16th and 17th centuries, alongside the emergence of other movements like Sikhism and Maharashtra Dharma.  This requires careful attention to the wording of the statement and the nuances of the passage.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage details Guru Arjun Dev's adoption of an aristocratic lifestyle and the establishment of a system for collecting offerings from Sikhs, illustrating his strategic approach to the movement's growth and consolidation of power.

Statement 3 is correct. Dara Shikoh's translation of the Gita and his assertion of the compatibility between the Vedas and the Quran clearly demonstrate his belief in the fundamental harmony between Hinduism and Islam, a perspective that stands in contrast to the prevailing orthodox views of the time.  This statement tests understanding of Dara Shikoh's role and his theological position.


**3.  With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of Sanskrit's prestige, coupled with the use of regional languages by Bhakti saints, facilitated the rise of these languages.
2.  Amir Khusrau, writing in the early fourteenth century, noted the widespread use of regional languages for daily life.
3.  The Vijayanagara rulers actively discouraged the use of regional languages in administration, preferring Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights the factors contributing to the rise of regional languages, including the decreasing prestige of Sanskrit and the pivotal role of Bhakti saints in popularizing vernacular tongues for literary expression.

Statement 2 is correct. Amir Khusrau's observation regarding the established usage of regional languages in daily life confirms their pre-existing presence and importance.  This is a subtle detail requiring close reading.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage indicates that regional languages were used for administrative purposes in pre-Turkish and even under Turkish rule, contradicting the assertion that Vijayanagara rulers actively *discouraged* their use. This introduces a factual contradiction as a distractor.  The passage mentions regional languages being used in the Vijayanagara empire for administrative purposes.


**4. With reference to the music and cultural synthesis during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's patronage of Tansen and other musicians fostered a blend of Indian and Persian musical traditions.
2.  Aurangzeb's reign witnessed a complete suppression of all forms of music in the Mughal court.
3.  The largest number of books on classical Indian music in Persian were written during the reign of Shah Jahan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's patronage of Tansen and the continuation of this tradition by subsequent Mughal rulers demonstrates the fusion of musical styles and the ongoing interaction between Indian and Persian musical traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clarifies that while Aurangzeb banned singing in his court, he did not suppress the playing of musical instruments, and musical activities continued within the harem and among nobles.  This demonstrates the need for precise comprehension of the text's details.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage states that the largest number of books on classical Indian music in Persian were written during Aurangzeb’s reign, not Shah Jahan's. This is a direct factual contradiction and a strong distractor, testing precise knowledge.



**5. With reference to the political and military aspects of the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of the Punjab laid the foundation for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The first battle of Tarain resulted in a decisive victory for the Ghurid forces under Muizzuddin Muhammad.
3.  Prithviraj Chauhan's failure to capitalize on his victory in the first battle of Tarain allowed Muizzuddin Muhammad to regroup.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ghurid conquests in the Punjab, culminating in the battles of Tarain, directly led to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate under the Ghurids and their successors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first battle of Tarain resulted in a defeat for the Ghurid forces, not a victory.  This is a key piece of information that distinguishes correct from incorrect answers.

Statement 3 is correct. Prithviraj Chauhan's failure to fully exploit his victory in the first battle of Tarain gave Muizzuddin Muhammad the crucial time and opportunity to reorganize his forces and prepare for a subsequent decisive confrontation.  This highlights the importance of strategic understanding in historical events.


These five questions offer a representative sample of the type and difficulty level suitable for a high-stakes exam like the UPSC.  They demand not just surface-level knowledge but also a nuanced understanding of the historical context, cultural interactions, and specific details present in the provided text.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible yet ultimately incorrect, testing the candidate's ability to critically analyze information and identify subtle inaccuracies.


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to the rise of regional languages as a medium for literary works.
2.  Amir Khusrau, writing in the early fourteenth century, observed that regional languages had long been used for everyday purposes.
3.  The use of regional languages for administrative purposes was largely confined to the post-Turkish period in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement played a crucial role in popularizing regional languages.  The saint-poets, in their efforts to reach a wider audience beyond the confines of Sanskrit and the elite, employed vernacular languages, thereby fostering their development and standardization for literary expression.  Their devotional poetry, accessible to the masses, became instrumental in shaping the linguistic landscape of medieval India.

Statement 2 is also correct. Amir Khusrau's observation highlights the pre-existing presence and usage of regional languages in daily life.  His acknowledgment confirms their established role in the societal fabric, even before their formal adoption for literary or administrative purposes. This underlines their organic growth and deep-rooted presence within the cultural context of the time.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The use of regional languages in administration predates the Turkish rule. The text indicates that some pre-Turkish regional kingdoms already utilized regional languages like Tamil and Kannada alongside Sanskrit for administrative purposes. The continuation and expansion of this practice under the Turkish rule is mentioned, but the statement wrongly confines it to the post-Turkish period.  The evidence suggests a broader and earlier adoption of regional languages in governance.


**2. With reference to the cultural exchange and integration in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical instruments like the sitar and tabla, significantly impacting Indian music.
2.  Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing several Perso-Arabic ragas and is associated with the invention of the sitar.
3.  The Ragadarpan, a classical Indian work on music, was translated into Persian during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Turks did introduce new instruments like the rabab and sarangi, the text explicitly states that the attribution of the sitar to Amir Khusrau lacks evidence. The tabla's development is also placed in a later period (late 17th or early 18th century), not during the Turkic era.  The question plays on the common misconception that all new instruments came with the Turks.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Amir Khusrau did introduce Perso-Arabic ragas, but the claim of his invention of the sitar is unsubstantiated. This statement tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between established facts and claims lacking historical evidence.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly mentions the translation of the Ragadarpan into Persian during Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reign, illustrating the cultural exchange between Indian and Persian musical traditions. This fact demonstrates the intellectual and artistic interaction between different cultural groups during the period.


**3. With reference to the literary landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mahabharata and Ramayana were translated into Bengali under the patronage of Nusrat Shah of Bengal.
2.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi, a Sufi saint, wrote the Padmavat in Persian, using the attack on Chittor as an allegory for Sufi concepts.
3.  Tulsidas, a prominent Hindi poet, advocated a modified caste system based on individual merit rather than birth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Nusrat Shah's patronage in translating the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Bengali. This highlights the role of royal patronage in promoting literary translation and the dissemination of major epics in regional languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Malik Muhammad Jaisi did write the Padmavat, it was written in Hindi (in the Awadhi dialect), not Persian. The statement incorrectly assigns the language of the work, testing the candidate’s knowledge of specific literary details.  The allegory used is correct, however.

Statement 3 is correct. Tulsidas, known for his humanistic approach, advocated a modified caste system based on individual merit and qualities, not birth.  This demonstrates his progressive social views within the context of the existing rigid caste system.  The statement focuses on a key aspect of Tulsidas's philosophy.


**4. With reference to the religious and social movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, preached Bhakti to all four varnas, disregarding caste restrictions on inter-dining.
2.  Kabir, a weaver by profession, vehemently denounced idol worship, pilgrimages and formal religious practices.
3.  Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism, undertook extensive tours across India, including Sri Lanka and the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ramananda's teachings and practices challenged the traditional caste system by extending Bhakti to all four varnas and disregarding the restrictions on inter-dining. This highlights his inclusive approach and his role in dismantling rigid social barriers.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir's critique of traditional Hindu and Muslim religious practices is well-documented. His rejection of idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious observances underscores his emphasis on a more personal and direct form of spirituality.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text specifically mentions Guru Nanak's extensive travels, encompassing various regions of India and extending beyond its borders to Sri Lanka, Mecca, and Medina.  These journeys underscore his missionary zeal and the wide reach of his teachings.  The statement tests knowledge of the geographical extent of Nanak's influence.


**5. With reference to the political landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Khalji dynasty overthrew the successors of Balban, ending the Turkish monopoly on high offices in the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's campaigns in the Deccan led to the conquest of Malwa and the establishment of direct administration there.
3.  Malik Kafur's expeditions to South India resulted in the complete annexation of all southern kingdoms under direct Delhi rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khalji's rise to power marked a significant shift in the Delhi Sultanate's power dynamics, ending the exclusive dominance of the Turks in high offices and opening opportunities for other groups.

Statement 2 is correct.  Alauddin Khalji's campaigns did extend to Malwa, but the statement is slightly misleading in implying *complete* and *direct* administration immediately after conquest. While Malwa was brought under Delhi's control, the extent and nature of its administration were more nuanced. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the complexities of imperial control.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Malik Kafur's expeditions, while impactful and far-reaching, did not result in the immediate and complete annexation of all southern kingdoms under direct Delhi rule.  The southern kingdoms retained a degree of autonomy, and the Delhi Sultanate faced challenges in maintaining long-term control over these newly conquered territories.  The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and formal worship, rejecting emotional devotion.
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, strongly supported the caste system and traditional Hindu rituals.
3.  Tantric practices, unlike the Bhakti movement, were largely inaccessible to lower castes and marginalized groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The Bhakti movement emphasized love and devotion to God, rejecting rigid austerities and formal rituals.  The Lingayat movement, a significant reformist movement, vehemently opposed the caste system, advocating for social equality and rejecting traditional Brahmanical practices.  Tantric practices, contrary to statement 3, were often open to all, irrespective of caste, and aimed at achieving spiritual liberation through various methods, including rituals and practices often considered unorthodox by mainstream Hinduism.  The Bhakti and Tantric movements were both significant responses to the rigid social and religious hierarchies of the time, providing alternative paths to spiritual fulfillment.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jainism experienced a significant decline during the 9th and 10th centuries due to the loss of royal patronage and internal rigidity.
2. The revival of Hinduism saw the emergence of Siva and Vishnu as chief gods, leading to the construction of magnificent temples and the assimilation of local deities.
3.  The Bhakti movement primarily attracted adherents from the upper castes, reinforcing existing social hierarchies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Jainism flourished in certain regions and periods, the 9th and 10th centuries saw a decline in South India due to a combination of factors, including the loss of royal patronage and an increasing rigidity within the Jain monastic orders. Statement 2 is also correct. The rise of Shaivism and Vaishnavism as dominant sects within Hinduism led to the construction of grand temples and the incorporation of numerous local and tribal deities into the broader Hindu pantheon, reflecting a process of religious syncretism. Statement 3 is incorrect.  A key characteristic of the Bhakti movement was its appeal to all castes, particularly the lower castes who were often excluded from Vedic scholarship and traditional Hindu practices.  The movement actively challenged the rigid caste system, offering a path to spiritual liberation accessible to all.


**3. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of Tantrism in North India and the Bhakti movement in South India both challenged caste inequalities and were inclusive of all social groups.
2.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy provided a powerful intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism, emphasizing the unity of God and the world.
3. Ramanuja's philosophy, while rooted in the Vedas, emphasized the importance of divine grace over knowledge for salvation, making it accessible to all castes, including Shudras and Dalits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the socio-religious landscape of medieval India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the inclusive nature of both Tantrism and the Bhakti movement, which actively challenged the rigid caste system by offering spiritual paths open to all, regardless of social standing. Statement 2 accurately describes Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, which provided a powerful philosophical counterpoint to Buddhism and Jainism, re-establishing Vedic authority and emphasizing the concept of non-dualism (Advaita). Statement 3 is also correct in its depiction of Ramanuja's philosophy, which, while grounded in Vedic tradition, placed significant emphasis on divine grace (prasada) as a means of achieving salvation, making it accessible to all social strata, including those traditionally marginalized.  These movements and philosophies played crucial roles in shaping the religious and social landscape of medieval India.



**4. With reference to the religious and cultural interactions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi movement in India actively discouraged interaction with Hindu saints and yogis, maintaining a strict separation between Islam and Hinduism.
2.  The Bhakti and Sufi movements shared a common platform of humanistic ideals, emphasizing love, devotion, and the unity of God, fostering interfaith understanding.
3. Kabir and Nanak, though critical of existing social orders, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social transformation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Sufi saints actively engaged in dialogue and exchange with Hindu saints and yogis, contributing significantly to the syncretic religious environment of medieval India. This interaction is evident in the shared themes and practices found in both Bhakti and Sufi traditions. Statement 2 is correct.  Both the Bhakti and Sufi movements, while rooted in different religious traditions, shared a common emphasis on love, devotion, and the unity of God (Tawhid/Brahman), creating a climate of religious tolerance and mutual understanding. Statement 3 is also correct. While both Kabir and Nanak were critical of social inequalities and championed religious unity, their primary focus remained on individual spiritual transformation through devotion and the guidance of a guru.  Their impact on larger social reforms was indirect, though significant in shaping a more inclusive and tolerant atmosphere.


**5. With reference to the literary and artistic developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Sanskrit literature during this period primarily focused on religious and philosophical works, neglecting other genres such as drama and fiction.
2.  The Persian language, introduced by the Turks, became a significant language of administration and literature, fostering cultural exchange between the Muslim and Hindu communities.
3. Regional languages experienced a decline due to the dominance of Sanskrit and Persian in the literary and administrative spheres.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While religious and philosophical works were prominent in Sanskrit literature, the period also saw significant contributions in other genres, including drama, fiction, poetry (kavya), and works on various sciences and arts.  Statement 2 is correct. The introduction of Persian by the Turkic rulers led to its widespread adoption as a language of administration, literature, and elite culture, fostering a degree of cultural exchange and interaction between the Muslim and Hindu communities.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The medieval period witnessed a significant flourishing of regional languages, often fueled by the Bhakti movement and the patronage of local rulers.  These languages emerged as vibrant mediums for literary and cultural expression, coexisting alongside Sanskrit and Persian.  The rise of regional literature demonstrates a complex linguistic landscape, not a decline.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana debates, while intended to foster understanding, actually increased religious tensions rather than leading to a unified system.  The debates highlighted differences rather than commonalities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Tauhid-i-Ilahi was not a new religion in the traditional sense; it was more of a syncretic Sufi-inspired order emphasizing monotheism and personal loyalty to Akbar. It didn't aim to replace existing religions.

Statement 3 is correct. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) was a cornerstone of his approach, promoting religious tolerance and harmony among various religious groups within the Mughal Empire.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the factually inaccurate statements 1 and/or 2.


**6. With reference to the various uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily driven by religious motivations and aimed to establish an independent Sikh state.
2. The Satnami rebellion involved mainly peasant communities and artisans, transcending religious and caste boundaries.
3. The Afghan uprisings were primarily tribal conflicts with limited religious or political significance for the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jat uprisings were primarily agrarian and socio-economic in nature, driven by issues related to land revenue and zamindari rights. Though religious elements might have been present, their primary goal wasn't establishing a Sikh state.

Statement 2 is correct. The Satnami rebellion involved diverse groups of peasants, artisans, and low-caste people, uniting across religious and caste lines.  Their shared grievances fueled the uprising.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Afghan uprisings, while having tribal roots, also reflected the desire for regional autonomy and had significant political implications for the Mughal Empire.  Religious and political motivations were intertwined.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the factually inaccurate statements 1 and/or 3.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tantrism movement actively challenged the caste system and offered spiritual paths open to all, regardless of caste.
2.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and formal worship, emphasizing a cold, detached approach to religious devotion.
3.  The Lingayat movement, while worshipping Shiva, embraced child marriage and prohibited widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Tantrism, a path preached by many yogis, particularly from lower castes, denounced the caste system and was open to all, irrespective of caste distinctions. This directly aligns with the statement's assertion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bhakti movement, as described in the text, directly contradicts this statement. It explicitly rejected austerities and viewed religion as a living bond of love between the devotee and God, emphasizing a warm, personal connection rather than a cold, formal one.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Lingayat movement, according to the text, strongly opposed the caste system, child marriage, and explicitly *allowed* the remarriage of widows.  This directly refutes the statement's claim.


**2. With reference to the patronage of religious and artistic movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chalukyan rulers of Gujarat were prominent patrons of Buddhism, as evidenced by the construction of numerous Buddhist temples.
2.  The Paramara rulers of Malwa primarily focused their patronage on Hinduism, neglecting Jainism and other religious traditions.
3.  The Ganga rulers of Karnataka actively supported Jainism, leading to the construction of numerous Jain temples and pillars, including the colossal statue at Sravana Belgola.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Chalukyan rulers of Gujarat patronized *Jainism*, leading to the construction of magnificent Jain temples like the Dilwara temple at Mount Abu.  There is no mention of Buddhist patronage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the Paramara rulers of Malwa building huge images of Jain saints and Mahavira (who began to be worshipped as a god), it does not suggest a neglect of other religious traditions.  Their patronage extended to Jainism.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly details the Ganga rulers of Karnataka's significant patronage of Jainism, resulting in the construction of numerous Jain temples, pillars, and the colossal statue at Sravana Belgola.


**3. With reference to the decline of Buddhism in early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of Buddhism was solely due to the persecution of Buddhists by invading Central Asian tribes who had converted to Hinduism.
2.  The Gupta dynasty's unwavering support for Buddhism played a crucial role in its eventual decline.
3.  The assimilation of Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu within Vaishnavism contributed to the decline of Buddhism as a distinct religion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions invading tribes adopting Hinduism, it doesn't attribute the decline of Buddhism *solely* to their persecution. Other factors are at play.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states the opposite; the Gupta dynasty's strong opposition to Buddhism is mentioned as a contributing factor to its decline.

Statement 3 is correct. The text specifically points out that Buddha being considered an incarnation of Vishnu and thus becoming part of Vaishnavism contributed significantly to the decline of Buddhism as a separate entity.  The absorption into Hinduism is highlighted as a key factor.


**4. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nagarjuna was a prominent proponent of the Bhakti cult, known for his significant contributions to the movement's devotional literature.
2.  Tukaram, Tyagaraja, and Vallabhacharya were all key figures associated with the Bhakti movement, representing diverse regional and philosophical strands within the tradition.
3.  The Bhakti movement successfully integrated all tribal groups into the Hindu fold, eliminating religious diversity in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nagarjuna was a prominent Buddhist philosopher, not associated with the Bhakti movement, which was a predominantly Hindu devotional tradition.

Statement 2 is correct. Tukaram (Maharashtra), Tyagaraja (Carnatic music, Andhra Pradesh), and Vallabhacharya (North India) were all important figures within the diverse Bhakti movement, demonstrating its regional spread and philosophical variations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement did successfully integrate many tribal groups into Hinduism, it didn't eliminate all religious diversity.  The text emphasizes the movement's broad appeal but doesn't claim complete religious homogenization.


**5. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings were primarily driven by religious motivations, aiming to establish a separate religious state.
2.  The Satnami movement, despite its religious character, received support from local Hindu zamindars who collaborated with the Mughal authorities to suppress the uprising.
3.  The Afghan uprisings were characterized by a unified tribal identity, with a single, overarching goal of establishing an independent Afghan state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jat uprisings, as described, had a strong peasant-agrarian background rooted in land revenue conflicts. While religious sentiments might have played a role in mobilizing support, the primary driver wasn't the creation of a separate religious state.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights the collaboration between local Hindu zamindars (many Rajputs) and the Mughals in suppressing the Satnami rebellion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Afghan uprisings did involve the desire for a separate state, the text describes them as having a tribal character with different tribes participating and their goals not always aligned.  A unified identity and singular goal are not accurately reflected in the source.


**6.  With reference to the Mughal succession crises, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal system of succession was clearly defined, with a strict primogeniture system ensuring a smooth transfer of power.
2.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor was universally accepted by all his sons, preventing any conflict.
3.  Aurangzeb's victory in the War of Succession was primarily due to his superior military skills and strategic acumen, rather than treachery or political maneuvering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there was no clear tradition of succession among Muslims or the Timurids, highlighting the ambiguity and potential for conflict.  The absence of a defined system is a key point.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text indicates that Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh sparked the War of Succession, with his other sons actively challenging Dara's claim. The lack of universal acceptance is a central theme.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's victory is attributed to a combination of military skill, strategic advantage, and also significant political maneuvering and treachery (like imprisoning Murad). The text doesn't portray his victory as solely based on meritocratic factors.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies were solely aimed at persecuting Hindus and suppressing non-Islamic religious practices.
2. Aurangzeb's religious policies were entirely consistent with the Sharia, and he never issued any secular decrees that modified religious laws.
3. Aurangzeb's personal life was marked by ostentation and lavish displays of wealth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb was orthodox, the text doesn't portray his policies as solely focused on persecuting Hindus.  It acknowledges that he ruled over a predominantly Hindu population and that a complete alienation of Hindus would be unworkable.  His policies were complex and involved both religious and secular considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions Aurangzeb issuing secular decrees (zawabits) that sometimes modified the Sharia to account for the realities of governing in India.  The existence of zawabits shows a nuanced approach not solely dictated by religious law.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text describes Aurangzeb's personal life as marked by simplicity, not ostentation. His dislike of extravagance is a recurring theme.


**8. With reference to the economic and administrative challenges faced by the Mughal empire during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The jagirdari system functioned efficiently throughout Aurangzeb's reign, providing adequate resources for the Mughal army.
2. Aurangzeb's conquest of the Deccan significantly improved the financial situation of the Mughal empire, solving the problem of jagir shortages.
3. The crisis of the jagirdari system was primarily due to the decline in the number of mansabdars and the resulting shortage of administrative personnel.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes a significant crisis within the jagirdari system during Aurangzeb's reign, with nobles facing difficulties in realizing expected income from their jagirs, leading to an inability to maintain their stipulated troops.  Efficiency is not reflected.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The conquest of the Deccan did not solve the jagir shortage problem.  The text states that the newly conquered areas yielded little income, exacerbating the issue. The annexation actually increased the administrative burden without proportional revenue increase.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The crisis wasn't primarily due to a decrease in mansabdars but rather the discrepancy between the paper income of jagirs and the actual revenue collected, along with the difficulties in collecting revenue in the newly acquired, unsettled areas of the Deccan.


**9. With reference to the factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of the Mughal empire was primarily due to Aurangzeb's flawed religious policies, which alienated the Hindu population and led to widespread rebellions.
2. The decline of the Mughal empire was solely a consequence of events that occurred after Aurangzeb's death, with his reign being relatively stable and prosperous.
3. The decline of the Mughal empire was a complex process influenced by economic, social, administrative, and international factors, with Aurangzeb's policies playing a contributing, but not solely decisive, role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text argues that Aurangzeb's reign should be viewed within the broader context of economic, social, administrative, and intellectual developments.  While his policies contributed to the decline, they weren't the sole cause.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly discusses the internal problems and challenges that emerged *during* Aurangzeb's reign, such as the crisis of the jagirdari system and the ongoing Maratha conflict, which laid the groundwork for the empire's later decline.

Statement 3 is correct. This statement accurately reflects the text's central argument: the decline was a multifaceted process involving economic factors (like the jagirdari crisis), social tensions, administrative weaknesses, and international pressures, with Aurangzeb's policies representing one significant contributing factor among many.


**10. With reference to the early interactions between Hindus and Muslims in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghaznavid conquests were primarily motivated by a desire for religious conversion, with Mahmud of Ghazni systematically destroying temples to force conversions.
2. The Ghaznavid rulers established a stable and integrated political system in the conquered territories, promoting peaceful coexistence between Hindus and Muslims.
3.  The Sufi preachers played a crucial role in fostering early interactions between Islam and Hinduism, promoting a message of love and faith that transcended religious boundaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahmud of Ghazni's raids involved temple destruction and plunder, the primary motivation was not religious conversion. The text emphasizes the "lure for plunder" and the Ghaznavids' desire for wealth as key factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ghaznavids' rule was characterized by raids and plunder, not the establishment of a stable and integrated political system.  Their rule was largely unstable and based on military power.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the role of Sufi preachers in promoting interaction between Islam and Hinduism, emphasizing their message of love and faith as a significant factor in the early stages of religious interaction.  Their emphasis on a shared spiritual essence is highlighted.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of Tantrism in North India challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in Hinduism, offering spiritual paths open to all irrespective of caste.
2. The Bhakti movement, primarily in South India, emphasized love and devotion over austere rituals, attracting followers from all castes, including the lower castes.
3.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, completely rejected the caste system, advocating for social equality and reforms like allowing widow remarriage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the rise of Tantrism in North India as a movement that challenged the caste system by offering a path open to all regardless of caste distinctions. This is a key aspect of Tantrism's appeal and its impact on the social fabric of the time.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bhakti movement in South India is described as rejecting austerities and emphasizing a loving bond between the devotee and God, making it accessible to all castes.  The inclusion of lower-caste saints further supports this.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Lingayat movement did strongly oppose the caste system and advocated for social reforms like widow remarriage,  it didn't completely reject the caste system. The text notes that they opposed the caste system but doesn't state a complete rejection.  This subtle difference makes the statement factually inaccurate within the context provided.  The Lingayats challenged the dominance of the Brahmanical order and existing social hierarchies but didn't abolish the caste system entirely.  UPSC questions often test such nuanced distinctions.


**2. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nath Panthi movement coincided with the Bhakti movement, both challenging the Brahmanical authority and advocating for social equality.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, though critical of existing social order, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social restructuring.
3.  The Vaishavite movement, while emphasizing love and devotion, remained largely within the framework of Hinduism and did not challenge the caste system fundamentally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly connects the Nath Panthi movement with the decline of Brahmanical prestige, suggesting a concurrent rise of movements questioning the established social order.  The context indicates that these movements shared a common goal of challenging Brahmanical dominance, thereby strengthening the argument for their simultaneity.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kabir and Nanak, while advocating for social harmony and denouncing caste discrimination, primarily focused on individual spiritual transformation through devotion and the guidance of a guru. Their impact on social reform was indirect, achieved through the spread of their philosophy rather than direct social activism.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Vaishavite movement, while promoting inclusivity by welcoming followers from all castes, operated within the broader framework of Hinduism.  The text notes that although they softened the rigidity of the caste system, they didn't fundamentally challenge its existence.  This reflects the complex interaction between religious reform and social structures in medieval India.  This nuance is a key element in understanding the complexities of the period and is frequently tested in UPSC examinations.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles of Jain temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a prime example of the Chalukyan style of architecture, known for its intricate carvings and use of marble.
2.  Magnificent Jain temples, built during the period of Chalukyan and Paramara patronage, served as resting places for travelers, reflecting their significance beyond religious functions.
3. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, though not a temple, showcases the high watermark of Jainism's influence in South India during the 9th and 10th centuries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is indeed a magnificent Jain temple, it's attributed to the patronage of the Chalukyas of Gujarat, not a reflection of their architectural style. The text doesn't specify the architectural style of the temple.  Attributing it to the Chalukyan style would be inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Jain temples served as resting places for travelers, highlighting their broader societal role beyond purely religious functions.  This shows the temples' integration into daily life and their importance for trade and communication networks.

Statement 3 is correct.  The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola is explicitly mentioned as evidence of Jainism's peak influence in South India during the 9th and 10th centuries.  The fact that it's not a temple itself doesn't negate its significance as a testament to the widespread adoption and prominence of Jainism during this period.  The UPSC often tests the ability to understand the broader historical context and significance of such monuments.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of North India during the period of the three empires (Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1. Dharmapala of the Pala dynasty extended his control over Kanauj, briefly establishing Pala dominance over a vast territory encompassing Punjab and parts of Central India.
2.  The Pratihara empire, under Nagabhatta I, successfully repelled the Arab incursions into Rajasthan and Gujarat, securing the northwestern frontiers of India.
3. Bhoja of the Pratihara dynasty, after consolidating his power, extended Pratihara control to the west up to the Sutlej River and East to Magadha and North Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dharmapala did occupy Kanauj and held a grand darbar, the extent of his control is exaggerated in the statement. The text suggests that his influence extended far but doesn't definitively confirm control over the vast territory mentioned, including Punjab and Central India. UPSC questions often test the ability to differentiate between influence and direct control.

Statement 2 is correct. Nagabhatta I's successful resistance to Arab incursions is explicitly mentioned in the text, highlighting his role in defending North India's northwestern borders.  This showcases the strategic importance of the region and the Pratiharas' role in safeguarding it.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes Bhoja's expansion to the west up to the Sutlej and his later eastern expansion into Magadha and North Bengal.  This demonstrates the extent of the Pratihara empire under his rule and the fluctuating power dynamics between the three empires. The ability to understand the ebb and flow of power during this period is frequently tested by UPSC.



**5. With reference to the early Turkish incursions into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's seventeen raids into India were primarily motivated by a desire to annex territory and establish a lasting Turkish presence in the Indian subcontinent.
2. The Hindushahi rulers, despite initial setbacks, offered prolonged and substantial resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's advances into the Punjab.
3. Mahmud of Ghazni's most significant raids targeted wealthy temples and cities, focusing on the acquisition of plunder rather than the establishment of long-term political control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mahmud of Ghazni did conduct numerous raids, his primary motivation was not territorial annexation. The text strongly suggests his focus was on plunder and wealth acquisition, not establishing lasting political dominance. UPSC often tests the ability to understand the motivations behind historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the prolonged and significant resistance offered by the Hindushahi rulers against Mahmud of Ghazni's repeated attacks.  This highlights the strength of the Hindushahi kingdom and the challenges faced by Mahmud in his early incursions.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly indicates that Mahmud's raids were targeted at wealthy temples and cities, and the primary objective was the acquisition of immense wealth and plunder, not long-term political control.  This is a key aspect of understanding the nature of the early Turkish incursions into India.


**6. With reference to the socio-economic conditions of India during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct group during this period, initially encompassing individuals from various castes who served in royal establishments.
2. While the social position of the Shudras improved gradually, the conditions of the Dalits (untouchables) worsened, with increased social stigma and exclusion.
3. Slavery existed during this period, primarily through the enslavement of prisoners of war and debtors, but there was no organized slave raiding as seen in the Turkish conquests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the emergence of the Kayastha caste from a heterogeneous group of individuals serving in royal administrations. This demonstrates the fluidity of the caste system and its adaptation to changing social dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. The text contrasts the gradual elevation of the Shudras with the deteriorating conditions of the Dalits. This highlights the complex and often contradictory social mobility within the caste system.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes the existence of slavery but emphasizes the absence of large-scale organized slave raiding, differentiating it from the patterns observed during the Turkish conquests.  This shows the different forms of social control and economic organization during this period.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of these subtle distinctions.


**7. With reference to the religious and intellectual climate of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa strongly defended Brahmanical privileges, asserting their exclusive right to read scriptures and preach.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed the liberal religious policies of Akbar and advocated for re-imposition of the jizyah tax.
3. The liberal religious policies of Akbar, which encouraged religious tolerance and interaction, were revived and became the norm during the 18th century, fostering a climate of rapprochement between Hindus and Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text highlights Raghunandan's staunch defense of Brahmanical privileges and his assertion of their exclusive rights in religious matters. This reflects the conservative response to the challenges posed by the Bhakti and other reformist movements.

Statement 2 is correct.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's liberal policies and his advocacy for a stricter, more orthodox approach to Islam are clearly mentioned in the text.  This highlights the tension between liberal and orthodox factions within Islam during this period.

Statement 3 is correct. The text concludes by noting that Akbar's liberal policies were revived during the 18th century, leading to increased religious tolerance and interaction between Hindus and Muslims. This shows the cyclical nature of religious and political attitudes in medieval India.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of such long-term trends and the cyclical nature of these movements.


**8. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal succession system lacked a clear tradition, with both Muslim and Timurid traditions offering ambiguous guidance on the selection of heirs.
2. Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor was unsuccessful due to the opposition from his other sons, who initiated a war of succession.
3. Aurangzeb's victory in the war of succession was primarily due to his superior military skills and strategic acumen, rather than religious orthodoxy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text emphasizes the ambiguity surrounding Mughal succession, highlighting the lack of a clear system and the conflicting influences of various traditions.  This underscores the political instability inherent in the Mughal empire.

Statement 2 is correct.  Shah Jahan's attempt to nominate Dara Shikoh is described as a contributing factor to the war of succession, as it fueled the ambitions of his other sons.  This shows the failure of attempts to establish a peaceful succession.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text attributes Aurangzeb's success to his superior military skills and strategic decision-making, rather than solely religious factors. This demonstrates the importance of military prowess in securing political power during this period.  The UPSC often tests the ability to analyze multiple factors contributing to historical events.


**9. With reference to the various uprisings against Aurangzeb's rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily peasant revolts with an agrarian background, fueled by issues related to land revenue collection.
2. The Satnami rebellion, though initially a local conflict, quickly escalated into a widespread uprising involving peasants, artisans, and lower castes, transcending religious divisions.
3. The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were primarily tribal in nature, but also reflected the ambition of establishing a separate Afghan state, independent of Mughal rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly describes the Jat uprisings as having peasant-agrarian roots, triggered by land revenue disputes.  This highlights the socio-economic factors contributing to rebellion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Satnami rebellion is described as transcending religious and caste divisions, involving a wide range of social groups.  This shows the broad-based nature of the resistance.

Statement 3 is correct. The text characterizes the Afghan uprisings as having both tribal and political dimensions, with the ambition of establishing an independent Afghan state playing a significant role.  This illustrates the complex interplay of tribal loyalties and political aspirations during this period. The UPSC often tests the ability to understand the multifaceted causes of historical events.


**10. With reference to the Bhakti movement in North India, consider the following statements:**

1. Namadeva, a tailor-turned-saint, composed poetry in Marathi expressing intense devotion and engaged in discussions with Sufi saints.
2. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, introduced the worship of Rama and disregarded caste distinctions in his teachings, accepting disciples from all castes.
3. Kabir and Nanak, while advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity and denouncing the caste system, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social restructuring.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly describes Namadeva's background, his poetic expression of devotion, and his interactions with Sufi saints.  This highlights the cross-religious interactions within the Bhakti movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Ramananda's teachings, including the substitution of Rama for Vishnu and his disregard for caste distinctions, are clearly mentioned in the text.  This shows his contribution to the movement's inclusivity.

Statement 3 is correct. The text reiterates that Kabir and Nanak, while promoting social harmony, focused primarily on individual spiritual transformation, not large-scale social change.  This shows the different approaches within the Bhakti movement.  The UPSC often tests the ability to differentiate between various approaches within the same movement.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nathpanthi movement primarily comprised of lower-caste yogis who challenged the Brahmanical caste system.
2. The Bhakti movement, led by the Alvars and Nayanmars, primarily focused on Siva and Vishnu and rejected extreme austerities.
3. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, vehemently opposed the caste system and advocated for social reforms such as allowing widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of significant socio-religious movements in medieval India.  The Nathpanthi movement, a form of Tantrism, actively recruited from lower castes and challenged the rigidities of the Brahmanical order.  Their emphasis on a caste-free path, called *tantra*, is well documented. The Bhakti movement in South India, spearheaded by the Alvars and Nayanmars, indeed centered on the worship of Vishnu and Siva, while rejecting harsh ascetic practices in favor of a devotional approach accessible to all.  Their use of Tamil fostered widespread appeal. The Lingayat movement, originating in Karnataka, was a powerful reformist movement that explicitly challenged the caste system, advocating for social equality and reforms like widow remarriage.  These characteristics clearly differentiate it from other contemporaneous movements.  Therefore, all three statements are historically accurate and represent key features of these movements.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a prime example of magnificent Jain architecture, built during a period of Chalukyan patronage.
2. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, depicting a Jain saint in rigid austerity, was constructed during the ninth and tenth centuries, a period of peak Jain influence in South India.
3.  The growth of Hinduism during this period saw the emergence of Siva and Vishnu as chief deities, accompanied by the construction of magnificent temples and the assimilation of local and tribal deities into the broader Hindu pantheon.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the religious developments in medieval India. The Dilwara Temple, a stunning example of Jain architecture, was indeed built under the patronage of the Chalukyas of Gujarat, representing a high point of Jain artistic and architectural achievement.  The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, a remarkable feat of sculpture, was indeed created during the ninth and tenth centuries, a period when Jainism flourished in South India under the patronage of Ganga rulers.  This statue symbolizes the enduring legacy of Jain religious practices and beliefs. The third statement correctly describes the revival and expansion of Hinduism, marked by the rise of Siva and Vishnu as dominant deities, the construction of grand temples, and a process of syncretism that incorporated local and tribal deities into the broader Hindu religious framework. This demonstrates the complex interplay of religious and cultural forces during the period.


**3. With reference to the philosophical and religious debates of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, which posits the non-dualism of Brahman and the world, presented a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism.
2. Ramanuja's philosophy emphasized the importance of divine grace (prapaṭṭi) over knowledge (jñāna) for attaining salvation, making the path to liberation accessible to all, including the lower castes.
3.  The orthodox Brahmanical response to the Bhakti movement and other reformist movements often involved reassertion of Vedic authority and Brahmanical privileges, as exemplified by the writings of Raghunandan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly represent key aspects of the intellectual and religious landscape of medieval India. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, a powerful philosophical system, directly challenged the tenets of Buddhism and Jainism by offering a different metaphysical framework and path to liberation.  His emphasis on the ultimate unity of Brahman and the world provided a compelling alternative. Ramanuja, while accepting the Vedantic tradition, significantly modified it by emphasizing the role of divine grace (prapaṭṭi) over knowledge (jñāna) as the primary means of achieving salvation.  This opened the path to moksha for all, irrespective of caste, marking a departure from more elitist interpretations of Vedanta.  Raghunandan's writings exemplify the orthodox Brahmanical response to the challenges posed by the Bhakti movement and other reformist trends.  His reassertion of Brahmanical authority and the hierarchical caste system reflects the resistance to the egalitarian ideals of those movements.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti and Sufi movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir, a weaver by profession, vehemently criticized idol worship, pilgrimages, and ritualistic practices common to both Hinduism and Islam, advocating for a monotheistic faith emphasizing love and devotion.
2.  The Bhakti movement's emphasis on love and devotion (bhakti) as the path to salvation resonated with Sufi mysticism, creating a common platform for interaction and exchange of ideas between Hindu and Muslim saints.
3.  Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, while advocating for monotheism and rejecting caste distinctions, emphasized the importance of a Guru for spiritual guidance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict crucial aspects of the Bhakti and Sufi movements. Kabir, a prominent figure known for his critique of religious orthodoxy, strongly opposed ritualistic practices prevalent in both Hinduism and Islam. He championed a simple, monotheistic faith emphasizing love and devotion to God, transcending sectarian divides.  His teachings resonated with many across religious lines. The Bhakti movement's emphasis on bhakti, with its focus on emotional devotion to a personal God, shared significant common ground with Sufi mysticism's emphasis on love and union with the divine. This commonality fostered significant interaction and exchange of ideas between Hindu and Muslim saints.  Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, similarly emphasized monotheism and rejected caste discrimination, but uniquely stressed the importance of a Guru as a guide on the spiritual path.  His emphasis on a living guru and a distinct set of scriptures distinguishes Sikhism from other contemporaneous movements.


**5. With reference to the cultural synthesis during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* aimed at religious tolerance and harmony, and included the establishment of the *Ibadat Khana* for interfaith discussions.
2.  The Mughal court became a prominent center for cultural synthesis, attracting poets, scholars, and artists from diverse backgrounds, leading to a flourishing of Persian and Sanskrit literature.
3.  Akbar's *tawhid-i-ilahi*, while not a new religion in the traditional sense, aimed to promote monotheism and personal devotion, attracting followers from different religious communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of cultural synthesis during the Mughal period, particularly under Akbar's reign. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) indeed aimed at fostering religious tolerance and harmony, and the *Ibadat Khana* (house of worship) served as a platform for interfaith dialogues and discussions.  While the *Ibadat Khana* ultimately proved less successful than intended, it reflects Akbar’s intent. The Mughal court under Akbar was a significant center for cultural exchange, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from various backgrounds.  This resulted in the production of a significant body of literature in both Persian and Sanskrit, and the translation of religious texts into Persian. Akbar's *tawhid-i-ilahi* (divine monotheism) wasn't a new religion in the conventional sense, but rather a syncretic movement promoting monotheism and personal devotion, attracting followers from different religious groups. It highlights Akbar's attempt to bridge religious divides.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the historical context.


**1. With reference to the religious and social climate of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan, a prominent Dharmashastra writer, advocated for the exclusive rights of Brahmins to read scriptures and preach, asserting a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga.
2. Ramdas, Sivaji's spiritual guru, vehemently opposed the egalitarian ideals of the Bhakti movement, emphasizing Brahminical supremacy.
3. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure in the Muslim orthodox movement, opposed the concept of *tauhid* and practices he deemed influenced by Hinduism, such as the use of music in religious gatherings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raghunandan's writings indeed emphasized Brahminical privilege and a hierarchical social structure, contrasting with the more egalitarian trends of the Bhakti movement.  His assertion of a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga reflects a conservative interpretation of Dharmaśāstra.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ramdas advocated for activism and a strong Hindu identity,  the provided text doesn't support the claim that he *vehemently opposed* the Bhakti movement's egalitarian ideals. His focus was more on asserting Brahminical privileges within a context of Hindu activism, not necessarily a direct rejection of Bhakti principles.  Further research is needed to ascertain his stance on the Bhakti movement comprehensively.

Statement 3 is correct. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's staunch opposition to *tauhid* (pantheistic mysticism) and certain practices perceived as Hindu influences is well-documented. His advocacy for a stricter interpretation of Islam and the re-imposition of the *jizya* tax exemplifies his conservative religious stance.  His actions were aimed at reinforcing Islamic orthodoxy in the Mughal court. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crises, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire had a clearly defined system of succession based on primogeniture, similar to the Hindu traditions of Rajput succession.
2. Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor was met with unanimous acceptance by his other sons, ensuring a smooth transition of power.
3. Aurangzeb's victory in the war of succession was primarily due to his superior military strategy and the divided counsel amongst his rivals, rather than solely religious differences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mughal Empire lacked a clearly defined and consistently followed system of succession.  While some Muslim thinkers advocated for the ruler's right of nomination, the practice was inconsistent, and Hindu traditions were equally varied and often led to succession disputes.  The Timurid tradition of partitioning was unsuccessful in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shah Jahan's attempt to nominate Dara Shikoh as his successor backfired, fueling the ambition of his other sons and triggering a bitter war of succession. The nomination of Dara did not ensure a peaceful transfer of power but rather exacerbated existing tensions.

Statement 3 is correct. Aurangzeb’s success in the war of succession stemmed from a combination of factors, most notably his astute military strategies and the lack of unity among his opponents. While religious differences played a role in the broader context of the Mughal court, Aurangzeb's victory wasn't solely attributable to religious orthodoxy versus liberalism, as both Muslim and Hindu nobles supported different contenders.


**3. With reference to Aurangzeb's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's policy toward temples strictly adhered to the Sharia's principle of allowing only the repair of existing temples, while strictly prohibiting the construction of new ones.
2. The re-imposition of the *jizya* tax under Aurangzeb was primarily an economic measure aimed at boosting the Mughal treasury and addressing financial constraints.
3. Aurangzeb's actions regarding temples and the *jizya* tax were largely motivated by a desire to consolidate his power and suppress potential rebellion from religious and political adversaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb initially claimed to follow the Sharia's principle regarding temples, his actions deviated significantly.  He ordered the destruction of both new and long-standing temples, especially during periods of political unrest, exceeding the letter and spirit of the Sharia's guidelines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The re-imposition of the *jizya* wasn't primarily an economic measure.  While it generated revenue,  the main objectives were political and ideological.  Aurangzeb aimed to rally the Muslim population, appease orthodox theologians, and assert the superiority of Islam within the empire. The funds collected were specifically allocated to religious figures.

Statement 3 is correct.  Aurangzeb's religious policies, including his treatment of temples and the *jizya*, were deeply intertwined with his political strategies.  He used these actions to consolidate his power, suppress opposition (both religious and political), and project an image of strong Islamic leadership within a diverse and often resistant population.  His policies were a significant factor in the growing unrest during his reign.


**4. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, Rama and Krishna, exclusively using Sanskrit as its medium of expression.
2. Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social hierarchies and advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity, ultimately failed to significantly impact the caste system or religious practices.
3. The Sufi movement in India, influenced by the monistic ideas of Ibn Arabi and its interaction with Hindu yogis, fostered a climate of religious tolerance and mutual understanding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement prominently featured the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, it used various regional languages in addition to Sanskrit, making it accessible to a wider populace.  The use of vernacular languages was crucial to its widespread impact.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While Kabir and Nanak's impact on the rigidities of the caste system was limited in the short term, their emphasis on egalitarianism and religious harmony significantly shaped the intellectual and religious climate of the time, influencing subsequent religious and social reform movements.  Their ideas laid the groundwork for future changes.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Sufi movement in India, particularly through the adoption of *tauhid* and its interaction with Hindu mystical traditions, significantly contributed to a climate of religious tolerance and mutual understanding, particularly before the rise of orthodox movements. The shared mystical experiences and concepts provided a common ground for interaction between different religious communities.  The use of Hindi in Sufi poetry further cemented this connection.


**5.  With reference to the administrative challenges faced by Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jagirdari system, despite being a cornerstone of the Mughal administration, faced a crisis of shortage of productive Jagirs and corruption amongst officials during Aurangzeb’s reign.
2. The decline of the Mughal nobility during Aurangzeb's reign was primarily due to a cessation of immigration from Central Asia, leading to a decline in administrative efficiency.
3. Aurangzeb's failure to effectively address the Maratha challenge stemmed from his inability to integrate the Marathas into the Mughal political system, compounded by his mistrust of their leaders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb's reign witnessed a severe crisis within the Jagirdari system.  The scarcity of productive Jagirs, coupled with widespread corruption among revenue officials, created significant administrative and financial problems, undermining the efficiency of the Mughal administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decline of the Mughal nobility wasn't solely attributable to the end of Central Asian immigration.  By Aurangzeb's time, the nobility was largely composed of Indian-born individuals. The argument of a decline due to climate is a racialist interpretation later promoted by British historians. The real cause of the decline was the internal weakening of the administrative system and the Jagirdari crisis.

Statement 3 is correct. Aurangzeb's failure to effectively manage the Maratha challenge was largely due to his inability to integrate them into the Mughal political system. His mistrust of Maratha leaders and his refusal to negotiate effectively prevented a peaceful resolution, leading to prolonged conflict and the eventual weakening of the Mughal Empire.  His policies towards the Marathas were a major contributing factor to the decline of the empire.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, as described in the text, is characterized by its emphasis on love and devotion between the god and the worshipper, rejecting austere practices and cold, formal worship.  This directly contradicts the statement.  The description of the Bhakti movement's emphasis on love and emotional connection serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced details of the movement.

1.  The growing rigidity of Jain principles and the dwindling royal patronage contributed significantly to the decline of Jainism.
2. The Bhakti movement successfully converted many adherents of Buddhism and Jainism to Hinduism, also incorporating several tribal groups.
3. Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to both Buddhism and Jainism, leading to their eventual decline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text directly attributes the decline of Jainism to the increasing rigidity of its doctrines and the loss of royal patronage.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Bhakti movement's success in attracting followers from Buddhism and Jainism, as well as incorporating tribal groups into the Hindu fold. This demonstrates the movement’s significant impact on the religious landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Shankara’s philosophy did challenge Buddhism and Jainism intellectually, the text doesn't explicitly state that it led to their decline.  Attributing the decline solely to Shankara's philosophy is an oversimplification of complex historical processes. The other factors contributing to the decline of these religions are presented as plausible distractors.


**4.  With reference to the political landscape of North India around the 12th Century, consider the following statements:**

1. The disintegration of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire created political instability, allowing for the rise of the Ghurid empire.
2.  The Ghurid ruler, Muizzuddin Muhammad, initially suffered a significant defeat at the hands of Prithviraj Chauhan in the First Battle of Tarain.
3. The Second Battle of Tarain decisively established Ghurid dominance in North India, marking a turning point in Indian history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly links the decline of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire with the subsequent political uncertainty and the rise of the Ghurids.  This establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes Muizzuddin Muhammad's defeat in the First Battle of Tarain, highlighting Prithviraj Chauhan's victory.  This challenges the candidate's understanding of the initial phases of the Ghurid expansion.

Statement 3 is correct. The text identifies the Second Battle of Tarain as a crucial turning point, establishing Ghurid control over significant parts of North India. This reinforces the significance of the battle as a pivotal moment in Indian history.


**5. With reference to the religious and intellectual currents of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kabir, a weaver by caste, vehemently criticized idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices, advocating for a religion of love and unity.
2.  Guru Nanak, while emphasizing the oneness of God, also stressed the importance of a guru for spiritual guidance and pure conduct.
3.  The Vaishnavite movement, particularly through figures like Chaitanya, rejected the use of music and dance in religious practices, focusing solely on scripture study.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately portrays Kabir's critique of traditional religious practices and his emphasis on love and unity, transcending caste and creed.

Statement 2 is correct. Guru Nanak's teachings, as described, highlight the importance of a guru, pure conduct, and devotion to a single God, while rejecting caste distinctions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions Chaitanya's use of music (kirtan) and dance as forms of mystic experience, directly contradicting the statement.  This serves as a significant distractor, testing detailed knowledge of the Vaishnavite movement.  The inclusion of this statement helps differentiate candidates with superficial knowledge from those with a deeper understanding.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently defended Brahmanical privileges, asserting their exclusive right to scriptural study and preaching, even positing a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of the jizya tax.
3. Ramdas, the spiritual guru of Shivaji, championed Brahmanical supremacy and actively promoted a philosophy of activism within the Hindu social structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of religious and social tensions in medieval India.  Raghunandan's assertion of Brahmanical dominance and his reductionist view of the varna system in the Kali Yuga is well-documented.  His writings highlight the entrenched power structures and the resistance to social change.  Similarly, Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's syncretic policies and his advocacy for a stricter, more orthodox interpretation of Islam, including the re-imposition of the jizya tax, represent a significant counter-movement to the prevailing liberal trends. His actions underscore the deep-seated religious conservatism within certain segments of the Muslim population.  Finally, Ramdas's philosophy of activism, while promoting a form of Hindu assertiveness, also included a strong emphasis on Brahmanical authority, reflecting the intertwining of religious and political power during this period.  The other options fail to encompass the full picture of the complex religious and social dynamics of the era.


**2. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, challenged traditional caste restrictions by teaching his doctrine of Bhakti to all four varnas and disregarding inter-caste dining prohibitions.
2. Kabir, a weaver by trade, emphasized the unity of God (Allah, Sain, Sahib) and denounced idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious rituals, irrespective of religious affiliation.
3. Namadeva, initially a tailor and later a saint, engaged in discussions with Sufi saints in Delhi, demonstrating the cross-religious exchange of ideas during the Bhakti movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe key aspects of the Bhakti movement and the figures associated with it. Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, transcending caste boundaries, was a significant departure from the rigid social norms of the time.  His acceptance of disciples from all castes, including the marginalized, is a testament to his radical social views. Kabir's syncretic philosophy, emphasizing the unity of God and rejecting ritualistic practices common to both Hinduism and Islam,  demonstrates the movement's ability to bridge religious divides and appeal to a broader audience. His rejection of caste distinctions and emphasis on individual piety further underlines this inclusivity. Namadeva's interactions with Sufi saints showcase the cross-religious dialogues and exchanges that characterized the period. This demonstrates a level of intellectual and spiritual interaction that fostered a climate of religious tolerance and mutual understanding.  The other options fail to recognize the full extent of the Bhakti movement's influence and the contributions of these key figures.


**3. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis and the role of key figures, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor, while intending to ensure a peaceful transition, ultimately fueled the war of succession among his sons due to perceived partiality.
2. Aurangzeb's victory at the Battle of Dharmat significantly boosted his prestige and demoralized Dara Shikoh's supporters, contributing to his eventual downfall.
3. Dara Shikoh's strategic error in deploying his best troops to the east, leaving Agra vulnerable, proved to be a critical factor in his defeat against Aurangzeb.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately portray crucial aspects of the Mughal succession crisis. Shah Jahan's attempt to preemptively resolve the succession issue by nominating Dara Shikoh backfired, as it intensified the rivalry among his sons.  This highlights the inherent instability within the Mughal system of succession and the lack of established protocols. Aurangzeb's victory at Dharmat was a pivotal turning point, shifting the momentum decisively in his favor. The battle's strategic significance and its impact on the morale of both sides are well-established historical facts.  Dara Shikoh's miscalculation in deploying his forces to the east, leaving the capital undefended, represents a significant tactical blunder that contributed significantly to his defeat. This underlines the importance of strategic planning and the consequences of underestimating one's opponents in warfare. The other options fail to fully account for the multifaceted nature of the conflict and the critical decisions that shaped its outcome.


**4. With reference to the religious and intellectual currents of the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Arabi's doctrine of "Tauhid-i-Wahdat al-Wujud" (Unity of Being), although denounced by orthodox elements, gained popularity in India, influencing Sufi thought and promoting a syncretic approach.
2. The Bhakti movement's emphasis on love and devotion to a personal God resonated deeply with Sufi mystics, leading to the use of Hindi Bhakti songs in Sufi musical gatherings (sama).
3.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi, a prominent Sufi saint, composed works in Hindi, reflecting the growing use of regional languages in expressing Sufi mystical concepts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the religious and intellectual climate of the 15th and 16th centuries. Ibn Arabi's philosophy, despite facing opposition from orthodox circles, significantly impacted Sufi thought in India. The concept of "Wahdat al-Wujud" fostered a more inclusive and syncretic approach, which aligned with the broader trends of religious tolerance and interaction. The convergence of Bhakti and Sufi mysticism is evident in the adoption of Hindi Bhakti songs in Sufi gatherings.  This cultural exchange and mutual influence highlight the cross-pollination of ideas during this period. Malik Muhammad Jaisi's use of Hindi underscores the growing importance of regional languages in religious and literary expression.  This shift away from Persian and Arabic reflects a conscious effort to reach a wider audience and connect with the local population. The other options fail to fully capture the extent of the interaction between Bhakti, Sufism, and the evolving linguistic landscape of medieval India.


**5. With reference to the socio-political dynamics within the Mughal Empire during Aurangzeb’s reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat revolts, initially agrarian in nature, eventually culminated in the establishment of an independent Jat principality, transforming from a peasant uprising to a political entity.
2. Aurangzeb’s conflicts with Afghan tribes, rooted in economic, political, and religious factors, involved numerous uprisings that significantly challenged Mughal authority in the northwest.
3. The Satnami rebellion, primarily composed of peasants, artisans, and low-caste individuals, was characterized by its rejection of caste distinctions and its unified resistance against Mughal rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the challenges Aurangzeb faced in managing various rebellions within his empire. The Jat revolts, starting as agrarian uprisings against revenue demands and injustices, progressively evolved into a powerful movement that ultimately led to the establishment of an independent Jat state. This transition highlights the interplay between social unrest and political upheaval. Aurangzeb's sustained conflicts with Afghan tribes in the northwest illustrate the persistent challenges posed by the region's rugged terrain and the fiercely independent nature of the Afghan population. These conflicts were complex, involving economic grievances, political ambitions, and religious differences. The Satnami rebellion, a unique movement that transcended caste boundaries, showcased the potential for collective resistance amongst marginalized groups. Their unified opposition against Mughal rule, despite their diverse backgrounds, is a significant aspect of Aurangzeb's reign.  The other options fail to fully capture the complex and multifaceted nature of the various rebellions that characterized Aurangzeb's rule.


**6. With reference to the cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The flourishing of Sanskrit literature during the medieval period, despite the rise of Persian, continued to support philosophical discussions, commentary on Dharmaśāstras, and advancements in fields such as medicine and astronomy.
2. The introduction of Persian as the language of administration by the Turks led to a significant development of Persian literature in India, with prominent figures like Amir Khusrau embracing India as their homeland.
3.  While Sanskrit and Persian served as major link languages, the translation of works between them remained limited, hindering a broader cultural exchange during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately represent the cultural dynamics of medieval India.  Sanskrit literature continued to thrive, demonstrating the resilience of traditional learning and its adaptation to the changing political landscape.  The production of philosophical works, commentaries on Hindu law, and advancements in various scientific fields showcase the continued importance of Sanskrit.  The rise of Persian as the language of administration and its adoption by the ruling class led to a flourishing of Persian literature in India. Figures like Amir Khusrau exemplify the integration of Persian culture with the Indian context. His writings reflect a deep connection to India and contributed significantly to the development of a unique Indo-Persian literary tradition. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the translation of works between Sanskrit and Persian wasn't as extensive as it could have been, there were instances of translation, demonstrating some degree of cross-cultural exchange.  The limited extent of translation does not negate the overall development of both literary traditions.  Therefore, only options 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Artisans and workers in medieval towns faced harsh living conditions, reflected in their low wages, even during the reign of Akbar, indicating persistent economic inequalities.
2.  The practice of Purdah, initially prevalent among the upper classes, spread widely during the Sultanate period, impacting women's lives and social mobility.
3.  Despite persistent social inequalities, medieval society wasn't devoid of joy, as festivals and fairs provided a degree of respite from the hardships of daily life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately capture aspects of socio-economic life in medieval India. The low wages of artisans and workers highlight the significant economic inequalities prevalent in both urban and rural areas, even during periods of relative prosperity.  This economic disparity underscores the social stratification and the challenges faced by the majority of the population. The spread of Purdah, a practice initially confined to the upper classes, further reflects the social changes and the impact of cultural influences from Central Asia.  While Purdah had various socio-religious justifications, its consequence was a restriction on women's freedom and participation in public life. Finally, the acknowledgement of festivals and fairs as sources of joy and community interaction provides a balanced perspective on the lives of ordinary people. The existence of these cultural events suggests that despite the hardships, life wasn't entirely devoid of social and communal celebrations.  The other options fail to appreciate the complexity of socio-economic realities and the range of experiences within medieval Indian society.


**8. With reference to the early Turkish incursions into India, consider the following statements:**

1. The disintegration of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire created a power vacuum in North India, facilitating the relatively unopposed initial incursions of the Turks.
2. Mahmud of Ghazni's seventeen raids into India were primarily motivated by the desire to acquire wealth from rich temples and towns, rather than any sustained effort at territorial conquest.
3. The Hindushahi rulers, despite facing internal divisions and lacking significant Rajput support, offered considerable resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's initial advances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the early Turkish incursions. The weakening of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire undeniably created a period of political instability in North India, making it easier for the Turks to penetrate the region. This lack of a unified and strong opposition facilitated the initial successes of the invading forces. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily focused on plundering wealth from temples and towns. While he did annex some territories, his primary motivation was the acquisition of riches, which fueled his military campaigns and consolidated his power in Ghazni. The Hindushahi rulers, despite their internal challenges and lack of broad Rajput support, put up significant resistance to Mahmud's initial advances. Their struggle highlights the inherent difficulties faced by smaller kingdoms in resisting powerful invading forces.  The other options fail to fully encompass the complex interplay of political fragmentation, economic motives, and military resistance that characterized the early Turkish incursions into India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the source material, creating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging. The questions below aim for a good balance of coverage and difficulty.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently asserted Brahmanical privileges, claiming only Brahmins possessed the right to read scriptures and preach, even suggesting a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya,  denouncing pantheistic mysticism (tauhid) as un-Islamic.
3. The Bhakti movement, spearheaded by Nayanmars and Alvars in South India, while not directly challenging the caste system, offered a path of devotion (bhakti) open to all castes, fostering religious inclusivity and significantly impacting social dynamics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of religious and social life in medieval India.  Raghunandan's assertion of Brahmanical supremacy and his reductionist view of the varna system are well-documented.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's syncretic policies and his advocacy for a stricter interpretation of Islam are also historically accurate.  The Bhakti movement's impact on social inclusivity, though not a direct assault on the caste system, is a significant aspect of its legacy.  The movement's emphasis on devotion as a path accessible to all, regardless of caste, contrasted sharply with the prevailing Brahmanical orthodoxy and facilitated the religious integration of various social groups.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the historical context.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crises and the role of key figures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire lacked a clear-cut tradition of succession, with the right of nomination by the ruler sometimes contested, as evidenced by the conflicts among Shah Jahan's sons.
2. Dara Shikoh, despite being nominated as Shah Jahan's successor, faced opposition from his brothers, primarily Aurangzeb, leading to a bitter war of succession.  
3. Raja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur initially supported Dara Shikoh but later switched allegiance to Aurangzeb after receiving promises of territorial concessions and religious freedom, highlighting the shifting political alliances of the time.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly details the ambiguity surrounding Mughal succession, the contest between Dara Shikoh and his brothers (particularly Aurangzeb), and the crucial role of Rajput alliances in shaping the outcome of the conflict.  The lack of a firm tradition of succession, the nomination of Dara Shikoh, and the subsequent war are all central themes.  Raja Jaswant Singh's shift in allegiance, motivated by Aurangzeb's strategic offers, exemplifies the complex dynamics of power and political maneuvering during this period.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete or partially inaccurate in their representation of the events.


**3. With reference to the religious and intellectual movements of 15th and 16th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir, a weaver by trade, emphasized the unity of God (Allah, Sain, Sahib), rejecting idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices, advocating a religion of love transcending caste and creed.
2. Guru Nanak, while born into a Khatri family,  embraced a mystic path, emphasizing monotheism and the importance of a guru, promoting a message of unity and rejecting caste distinctions, similar to Kabir’s teachings.
3. The Vaishavite movement, centered around the worship of Rama and Krishna, used the allegorical love story of Radha and Krishna to represent the bond between the individual soul and the supreme soul, fostering a more inclusive and emotionally resonant form of devotion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage accurately portrays the key tenets of Kabir's and Nanak's teachings, highlighting their emphasis on monotheism, rejection of ritualistic practices, and advocacy for social harmony.  The description of the Vaishavite movement's use of the Radha-Krishna narrative to express spiritual devotion is also accurate, and it aligns with the broader trend of Bhakti movements emphasizing emotional and accessible pathways to religious experience.  The three statements accurately reflect the distinct yet interconnected nature of these significant religious and intellectual movements of the period.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) fail to encompass the full scope of the described movements.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the political and military aspects of the early Turkish conquests in India:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of India was preceded by the weakening of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, creating a power vacuum that facilitated Turkish expansion.
2. The Battle of Tarain (1192) is widely considered a pivotal moment, marking a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of Turkish rule in North India.
3.  Mu'izzuddin Muhammad Ghori's initial campaign into Gujarat in 1178 ended in a decisive defeat, highlighting the challenges the Ghurids faced in their early attempts to conquer India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect the sequence of events and the strategic context of the early Turkish conquests. The decline of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire created an opportune environment for the Ghurids to expand their influence. The Battle of Tarain (1192) is indeed a crucial turning point, marking the beginning of sustained Turkish rule in North India.  The failure of the 1178 Gujarat campaign underscores the initial challenges faced by Mu'izzuddin Muhammad Ghori before achieving his later successes. Options (a), (b), and (d) thus present incomplete or partially inaccurate accounts of the historical narrative.


**5. With reference to the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq and its consequences, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq, while outwardly exhibiting religious orthodoxy, maintained the essential policies of his predecessors, avoiding complete subservience to theological dictates in state affairs.
2.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq’s economic policies, including extensive canal construction, aimed at improving irrigation and the overall economic condition of the empire.
3.  The institution of a large slave corps by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, while initially intended to strengthen his rule, ultimately contributed to administrative instability and the weakening of the Sultanate after his death.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes Firuz Shah Tughlaq's complex approach to religious policy, his substantial public works projects focusing on irrigation, and the ultimately destabilizing effect of his reliance on a vast slave army.  The statements accurately capture the nuanced aspects of his reign and its long-term consequences.  Options (a), (b), and (d) therefore fail to represent the complete and accurate picture presented in the source material.  The contradictory nature of Firuz's religious policies, his pragmatic economic approach, and the unintended consequences of his reliance on slaves are all crucial elements in understanding the dynamics of his reign and the subsequent decline of the Delhi Sultanate.

Statement 3 correctly describes Akbar's religious policies, mentioning the abolition of discriminatory taxes and practices to promote religious tolerance and integrate Rajput rulers into the Mughal system. The text confirms these actions as integral to Akbar's approach.


**6. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of jagirs, corruption, and reduced mansabdar incomes, led to widespread discontent and strained relations between the Mughal emperors and the nobility.
2. Aurangzeb's policies towards the Marathas, marked by a failure to negotiate effectively and a lack of trust, contributed significantly to the empire's weakening and the rise of Maratha power.
3. Aurangzeb's conquest of the Deccan, while initially aiming to subdue the Marathas, ultimately overextended the Mughal administration, straining resources and making it vulnerable to further rebellions and weakening the empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire.

Statement 1 correctly identifies the Jagirdari crisis as a major source of instability, noting the shortage of jagirs, corruption within the system, and the resulting financial hardship faced by the mansabdars. The text explains how this weakened the nobility's loyalty and support for the empire.

Statement 2 correctly analyzes Aurangzeb's flawed approach to the Maratha problem, highlighting his failure to negotiate effectively and his distrust of Maratha leaders, which escalated the conflict and strengthened the Maratha challenge to the empire.

Statement 3 correctly explains how the conquest of the Deccan, while intended to curb Maratha power, ultimately overstretched the Mughal administration, leading to resource depletion, increased vulnerability to rebellions, and ultimately contributed to the empire's decline.

**7. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghaznavid raids, led by Mahmud of Ghazni, were primarily focused on plundering wealth from temples and towns, rather than establishing lasting political control over conquered territories.
2. The Ghurid conquests, under Muizzuddin Muhammad, began with the conquest of Multan and Uchch, followed by a failed attempt to invade Gujarat, before establishing a base in Punjab and ultimately conquering Delhi.
3. The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) and Chandawar (1194) were pivotal in establishing Turkish rule in north India, marking the defeat of the Hindushahi rulers and the Gahadavala kingdom.

**8. With reference to the cultural developments in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi during the medieval period was partly due to the decline of Sanskrit's prestige and the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints in their religious teachings.
2.  The integration of Persian and Indian musical traditions under the Delhi Sultanate and subsequent Mughal rule led to the introduction of new musical instruments, modes, and scales, resulting in a distinct Indo-Persian musical style.
3.  The development of Persian literature in India saw the emergence of prominent writers like Amir Khusrau, who embraced Indian culture and created a new style of Persian known as the 'sabag-i-hindi', and historians like Ziauddin Barani.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the historical context and details.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently opposed the liberal religious policies of Akbar, advocating for the re-imposition of the jizya tax.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, championed pantheistic mysticism (tauhid) as a means of fostering Hindu-Muslim unity.
3. Ramdas, the spiritual guru of Shivaji, actively promoted a philosophy of activism that challenged Brahmanical privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raghunandan, a significant Dharmashastra writer, strongly asserted Brahmanical privileges and opposed any dilution of their authority, indirectly reflecting a resistance to Akbar's inclusive policies.  His views were in direct contrast to the more syncretic approaches of some Sufi saints.  The re-imposition of the jizya tax was indeed advocated by orthodox elements as a means of asserting Islamic dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi was a staunch opponent of pantheistic mysticism (tauhid), viewing it as un-Islamic and a deviation from orthodox Islamic beliefs. He actively worked against the liberal religious policies of Akbar, advocating for a stricter adherence to traditional Islamic practices and a more distinct separation between Hindus and Muslims.

Statement 3 is correct. Ramdas, a prominent figure in Maharashtra, championed a philosophy of activism within the Hindu context. While he didn't explicitly challenge Brahmanical privileges in the same manner as some other reform movements, his emphasis on action and engagement in worldly affairs was a departure from purely devotional or ascetic approaches. His emphasis on a particular form of Hinduism was also a counterpoint to the more syncretic approaches of some other religious leaders of the period.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crises, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor was primarily driven by his belief in Dara's superior religious tolerance and commitment to Hindu-Muslim unity.
2.  The battle of Samugarh was decisively won by Aurangzeb due to his superior military strategy and the numerical superiority of his army compared to Dara Shikoh's forces.
3.  The Rajput rulers, particularly Raja Jaswant Singh, remained steadfast in their support for Dara Shikoh throughout the war of succession, viewing him as the most capable candidate to maintain the empire's stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dara Shikoh’s religious tolerance might have been a factor, Shah Jahan's decision to nominate Dara was primarily driven by Dara being his eldest son. The succession was not based on religious views, but on the traditional order of succession.  The text highlights the other princes' perception of Shah Jahan's partiality, directly contradicting a motivation based solely on religious tolerance.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs clarification. Aurangzeb did win the Battle of Samugarh due to his superior generalship.  However, the text indicates the forces were roughly equal in number (around 50,000-60,000 on each side), making "numerical superiority" inaccurate.  The key to Aurangzeb's victory was his superior tactical skill and the better training and discipline of his troops.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Rajput support was not steadfast.  While some Rajput rulers initially supported Dara, Aurangzeb successfully secured the allegiance of important Rajput figures like the Rana of Udaipur through strategic alliances and promises, turning the tide of the war.  The text clearly states Dara's failure to win over Rajput support, particularly from Jaswant Singh, who initially hesitated and eventually sided with Aurangzeb.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Namadeva's poetry, written primarily in Marathi, emphasized the importance of strict adherence to Vedic rituals and the caste system as pathways to salvation.
2.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, significantly broadened the appeal of Bhakti by extending its teachings to all four varnas and disregarding traditional caste restrictions on communal eating.
3.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social orders, ultimately failed to make a significant impact on the deeply entrenched caste system in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Namadeva's poetry, written in Marathi, is characterized by intense love and devotion to God, not an emphasis on Vedic rituals or the rigid adherence to the caste system.  His interactions with Sufi saints also highlight a more syncretic approach.

Statement 2 is correct. Ramananda, a key figure in the Bhakti movement, significantly challenged the caste system by extending his teachings to all varnas and disregarding traditional social barriers related to food sharing and communal practices.  This inclusive approach contributed greatly to the movement's widespread popularity.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While Kabir and Nanak did not completely dismantle the caste system, their impact was significant in creating a climate of opinion that challenged its rigid structure and promoted social harmony. Their teachings emphasized the unity of God and the equality of humankind, irrespective of caste or creed, which influenced subsequent social and religious movements.  The statement underestimates their long-term influence.


**4. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sanskrit literary tradition experienced a decline during the medieval period, largely due to the dominance of Persian and regional languages in the courts of the Delhi Sultanate and other kingdoms.
2.  Amir Khusrau, a notable figure in Persian literature, demonstrated a deep appreciation for Indian culture and languages, contributing to a new style of Persian known as the "sabag-i-hindi."
3.  The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian during the medieval period was a rare occurrence, limited to a few isolated instances and failing to foster significant cross-cultural exchange.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sanskrit literary tradition not only continued but flourished during the medieval period.  While Persian and regional languages gained prominence, Sanskrit remained a significant vehicle for higher thought, philosophy, and literature, particularly in regions outside of direct Sultanate control and within the patronage of Hindu rulers.  The existence of Sanskrit schools and academies under Muslim rule further demonstrates its continued importance.

Statement 2 is correct. Amir Khusrau's work exemplifies the cultural synthesis of the medieval period. His deep appreciation for Indian culture and languages is reflected in his literary contributions and the development of a distinct "sabag-i-hindi" style of Persian writing.  His involvement in religious musical gatherings further illustrates his inclusive approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian, and vice versa, was not a rare occurrence.  While the scale might have varied over time and across regions, the text mentions several examples of such translations, including works on medicine, music, and literature, demonstrating a degree of cross-cultural exchange facilitated through literary translation.  This exchange was far more substantial than the statement suggests.


**5. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system remained completely rigid and impermeable during the medieval period, with no instances of social mobility or the emergence of new castes.
2.  The position of the Dalits (untouchables) improved significantly during the medieval period, with increased access to land ownership and participation in mainstream social and religious life.
3.  The practice of sati (widow immolation) was universally condemned and actively suppressed by both Hindu and Muslim rulers throughout the medieval period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The caste system, while remaining a significant social structure, did exhibit some degree of fluidity during the medieval period.  The text mentions the emergence of new castes and the social mobility of certain groups, highlighting the complexities and evolving nature of the caste system. The Kayasthas, for example, emerged as a distinct caste from a heterogeneous group of people working in royal establishments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The position of Dalits did not improve significantly during the medieval period.  The text notes that their social standing may have even deteriorated in certain aspects, emphasizing their continued marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society.  They faced restrictions on land ownership and were subject to various forms of discrimination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The practice of sati was not universally condemned during the medieval period.  While some condemned it, others considered it acceptable under certain circumstances.  The text indicates the practice's prevalence, linked to factors like property rights and disputes within upper-class families.  The extent of its practice and the official response to it varied considerably over time and across regions.


**6. With reference to the political developments leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of north India was primarily motivated by a desire to spread Islam throughout the region and establish a unified Islamic empire.
2. The battle of Tarain (1192) decisively ended the dominance of the Chauhan dynasty in north India and paved the way for the establishment of Turkish rule in Delhi.
3. Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat at the Battle of Tarain can be solely attributed to his underestimation of the Ghurid forces and his failure to secure alliances with other Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ghurid conquests were facilitated by their Islamic faith, the primary motivations were likely a combination of factors including political ambition, the desire for territorial expansion, and access to India's wealth. The text does not portray a singular religious objective for the Ghurid incursions.

Statement 2 is correct. The second battle of Tarain (1192) marked a turning point in Indian history, leading to the decline of the Chauhan dynasty and laying the foundation for the establishment of Turkish rule in the Delhi region.  This marked a significant shift in political power in North India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Prithviraj Chauhan’s underestimation of the Ghurids might have been a factor, attributing the defeat solely to this would be an oversimplification.  The text highlights the superior organization, training, and tactics of the Ghurid army as crucial factors in their victory.  The lack of complete support from other Rajput rulers also played a role, but it wasn't the sole cause of the defeat.  The text suggests a complex interplay of factors, including military prowess and political alliances.


**7. With reference to the early Mughal administration and its composition, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility under Akbar consisted primarily of Indian Muslims, reflecting a deliberate policy of promoting indigenous talent and minimizing reliance on foreign mercenaries.
2.  The inclusion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility was a gradual process, starting under Akbar and continuing under subsequent rulers, with Rajputs forming a prominent segment of this group.
3.  The Mughal mansabdari system ensured a highly meritocratic and efficient administration, completely eliminating favoritism and corruption within the ranks of the nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The early Mughal nobility was not primarily composed of Indian Muslims.  While Indian Muslims were certainly included, the nobility initially comprised a diverse group including Central Asian and Iranian elements. The text mentions the inclusion of Afghans and Indian Muslims later, but not as a primary initial characteristic.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility, particularly Rajputs, started under Akbar and continued under his successors.  This was a significant development in the Mughal administration, reflecting a policy of incorporating local elites into the imperial structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the mansabdari system aimed for efficiency and organization, it didn't eliminate favoritism or corruption completely.  The text mentions instances of nobles misusing their positions and engaging in corrupt practices.  The system, while structured, was still susceptible to the influence of personal relationships and self-interest.  The text highlights the complexities of the system, including the challenges in maintaining discipline and efficiency within the nobility.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the source material, generating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging.  The following examples demonstrate the desired format and difficulty level.  More questions could be generated if the token limit were increased.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently defended Brahmanical privileges, asserting their exclusive right to scriptural study and preaching, even suggesting a two-varna system (Brahmins and Shudras) in the Kali Yuga.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya, stricter treatment of Hindus, and minimal interaction between Muslims and Hindus.
3.  The liberal religious policies of Akbar, characterized by a degree of religious syncretism, were largely successful in achieving widespread religious harmony and completely eradicated interfaith tensions during his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Raghunandan's conservative views and his assertion of Brahmanical dominance.  Statement 2 correctly describes Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's orthodox stance and his opposition to Akbar's policies.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Akbar's policies promoted a degree of religious tolerance and syncretism (represented by Din-i Ilahi), they did not completely eradicate interfaith tensions.  Religious conflicts and tensions continued throughout the Mughal period and even intensified under later rulers like Aurangzeb.  The text emphasizes the recurring cycles of liberalism and orthodoxy, indicating that Akbar's policies, while significant, did not create a permanently harmonious religious landscape.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crises and the role of Rajput rulers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire lacked a clear tradition of succession, with the right of nomination by the ruler often challenged by other princes, mirroring similar ambiguities within Rajput succession practices.
2.  Shah Jahan's attempt to nominate Dara Shikoh as his successor exacerbated tensions among his sons, directly leading to the war of succession which Aurangzeb ultimately won.
3.  Raja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur consistently supported Dara Shikoh throughout the war of succession, remaining a steadfast ally despite Aurangzeb's military victories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights the lack of a clear-cut succession system in both Mughal and Rajput traditions, leading to frequent power struggles. Statement 2 accurately describes how Shah Jahan's favoritism towards Dara Shikoh triggered the war of succession.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Raja Jaswant Singh initially supported Dara Shikoh, he eventually switched allegiance to Aurangzeb after the Battle of Dharmat, influenced by Aurangzeb's promises and the shifting political landscape. The text shows Jaswant Singh's eventual support for Aurangzeb as a crucial factor in Dara's defeat.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its social impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, extended the Bhakti doctrine to all four varnas, challenging traditional caste hierarchies by allowing disciples from all castes to cook and eat together.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social structures, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social reform movements aimed at dismantling the caste system.
3.  The Bhakti movement completely eliminated the practice of untouchability and caste discrimination in India, establishing a society based on perfect equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, transcending caste boundaries. Statement 2 correctly points out that while Kabir and Nanak challenged the caste system and advocated for social harmony, their primary focus remained on individual spiritual transformation rather than direct, large-scale social reform.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the Bhakti movement significantly challenged caste rigidities and promoted social harmony, it did not entirely eliminate untouchability or caste discrimination.  These practices persisted even after the Bhakti movement. The text explicitly states that while the movement softened the rigors of the caste system, it did not create a completely egalitarian society.


**4.  With reference to the socio-religious landscape during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq, despite his orthodox leanings, commissioned translations of Hindu religious texts into Persian, demonstrating an interest in understanding Hindu beliefs and practices.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate consistently maintained a strict separation of religious and political authority, with theologians having no influence on state policy.
3.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq's policy of collecting young boys as slaves was primarily motivated by a desire to strengthen his army with loyal troops and foster economic growth through the development of royal workshops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Firuz Shah Tughlaq's actions, showing a degree of intellectual curiosity and a pragmatic approach towards the Hindu population. Statement 3 correctly explains Firuz's slave policy's dual aims: military loyalty and economic development.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sultans didn't always follow theological dictates directly, the text notes that they made concessions to theologians to maintain their support, impacting state policies. The relationship between religious and political power was complex and not one of complete separation.  The appointment of theologians to high offices indicates a degree of influence.


These examples illustrate the creation of challenging, UPSC-style MCQs based on your criteria.  Remember that the difficulty lies in the nuanced and specific factual details, plausible distractors, and the requirement for precise recall.  More questions could be developed if the token limit allowed for more detailed analysis of the source material.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history, religion, and society.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan, a prominent Dharmashastra writer, advocated for the exclusive rights of Brahmins to read scriptures and preach, asserting a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga.
2. Ramdas, the spiritual guru of Shivaji, vehemently opposed the Brahmanical privileges and championed a philosophy of egalitarianism.
3. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raghunandan's writings indeed emphasized Brahminical supremacy and a reduced varna system in the Kali Yuga, reflecting orthodox Hindu sentiments.  Statement 3 is also correct; Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's staunch opposition to Akbar's religious syncretism and his advocacy for a stricter, more orthodox Islamic state, including the reintroduction of jizya, are well-documented historical facts.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While Ramdas advocated activism, he was not opposed to Brahmanical privileges; his philosophy, while promoting a form of Hindu activism, did not necessarily challenge the existing social hierarchy to the extent implied in the statement.  His focus was more on a dynamic and assertive Hinduism.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crises, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire lacked a clear tradition of succession, with both Muslim and Timurid practices proving inconclusive.
2.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor exacerbated tensions among his sons, leading to a war of succession.
3. The Battle of Samugarh (1658) decisively ended the war of succession, solely due to Aurangzeb's superior military tactics and Dara Shikoh's poor strategic decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical context.  The Mughal Empire lacked a consistent and universally accepted system of succession, leading to frequent power struggles. Shah Jahan's favoritism towards Dara Shikoh undoubtedly fueled the ambitions of his other sons, setting the stage for the war of succession.  However, statement 3 oversimplifies the complex dynamics of the Battle of Samugarh.  While Aurangzeb's superior generalship was a significant factor in his victory, Dara Shikoh's strategic errors were not the sole cause of his defeat. Other factors included the divided loyalties within Dara's army, Aurangzeb's effective alliance-building with Rajput rulers, and the overall political and military climate of the time.


**3. With reference to religious movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement in South India, led by Nayanmars and Alvars, emphasized personal devotion to Siva and Vishnu, rejecting austerities and transcending caste barriers.
2.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, opposed the caste system, child marriage, and promoted widow remarriage.
3. Shankaracharya's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism by emphasizing the unity of God and the created world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate depictions of significant religious movements in medieval India. The Bhakti movement in South India, spearheaded by the Nayanmars and Alvars, is known for its emphasis on personal devotion, its rejection of rigid asceticism, and its relative inclusivity across caste lines. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, is renowned for its strong opposition to the caste system and its progressive social reforms.  Shankaracharya’s Advaita Vedanta, a significant philosophical system, indeed presented a powerful intellectual counterpoint to Buddhism and Jainism through its concept of non-dualism (Advaita) and its emphasis on the unity of Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (individual self).


**4. With reference to the socio-political context of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct social group, comprising individuals from various castes who served in royal establishments.
2.  The Jats, initially a pastoral nomadic group, transitioned into agrarian communities and warriors, occupying a high social standing among Shudras.
3.  The condition of Dalits deteriorated during this period, facing social exclusion, restrictions on land ownership, and the practice of untouchability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of medieval Indian society. The Kayastha caste's origin as a heterogeneous group serving in royal courts is well-documented, highlighting the fluidity and complexity of caste formation. The Jats' transformation from pastoral nomads to agrarian communities and warriors, while remaining within the Shudra varna, is a significant social and historical development.  Finally, the worsening condition of Dalits, characterized by social exclusion, land ownership restrictions, and the persistence of untouchability, is a well-established feature of this period.


**5. With reference to the religious and cultural synthesis in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi movement, particularly the Chishti order, fostered a climate of religious tolerance and interaction with Hindu traditions, utilizing Hindi in their devotional practices.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, through their teachings, emphasized monotheism and the unity of all religions, challenging existing social hierarchies and advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity.
3.  The Vaishnava Bhakti movement, with figures like Chaitanya, Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, and Surdas, promoted a humanistic approach to religion, focusing on love and devotion, relatively transcending caste distinctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the religious and cultural synthesis during the medieval period. The Chishti Sufi order, with its emphasis on inclusivity and its use of local languages in its devotional practices, played a crucial role in fostering interfaith dialogue. Kabir and Nanak's teachings, emphasizing the unity of God and challenging social divisions, created a climate conducive to religious harmony.  The Vaishnava Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on love, devotion, and its relative disregard for strict caste boundaries, further contributed to the religious and cultural synthesis of this era.  The widespread use of vernacular languages in religious discourse also helped bridge the gap between different communities.


**6. With reference to the political and military aspects of the Ghurid conquest, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of North India began after the weakening of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire created a power vacuum.
2.  The Battle of Tarain (1192) marked a decisive turning point, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
3.  The Ghurids' military success was primarily attributed to their superior cavalry tactics and the lack of effective unified resistance from the Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the historical context of the Ghurid conquest. The decline of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire indeed created a power vacuum in North India, making it vulnerable to external forces. The second Battle of Tarain was a pivotal moment, significantly contributing to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.  The Ghurids' superior cavalry tactics, along with the fragmented nature of Rajput resistance, were crucial factors in their military success.  The lack of a united front among the Rajput kingdoms significantly hampered their ability to effectively counter the Ghurid advance.



**7. With reference to the social structures and practices in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The practice of sati, while not universally mandated, was prevalent among certain sections of society, influenced by factors like property rights and social status.
2.  Women, despite facing restrictions on education and public life, held positions of power and influence in some regions, such as Orissa and Kashmir.
3.  Slavery existed, often stemming from war captivity, debt bondage, or famine, although slaves were generally treated better than members of the antyaja (untouchable) castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of social structures and practices in medieval India.  The practice of sati, while not legally enforced everywhere, was prevalent among certain groups and often intertwined with issues of property inheritance and social standing.  Women, despite societal restrictions, did manage to occupy positions of political power in certain regions like Orissa and Kashmir,  demonstrating the nuanced realities of gender roles.  Slavery existed in various forms, and while harsh, the treatment of slaves was often less severe than that of the untouchables, highlighting the complex hierarchies and social inequalities of the time.



**8. With reference to the Mughal nobility and its role in the economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility was a diverse group, incorporating Afghans, Indian Muslims, and Hindus, with the proportion of Hindus increasing under Aurangzeb.
2.  Mughal nobles led lavish lives, spending heavily on various aspects including maintaining large households, horses, and engaging in extensive trade.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe characteristics of the Mughal nobility and its economic role. The Mughal nobility was remarkably diverse in its ethnic and religious composition, with Hindus becoming a significant portion under Aurangzeb's reign.  The nobles' opulent lifestyle, characterized by extravagant spending on various aspects, is well documented.  Finally, their involvement in land ownership, moneylending, and trade significantly impacted the Indian economy, demonstrating the complex relationship between the ruling elite and the broader economic landscape.  The Mughal nobility's participation in trade and commerce was not merely a matter of personal enrichment; it played a crucial role in the functioning and development of the economy.


**9. With reference to the various uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily agrarian in nature, stemming from issues related to land revenue and zamindari rights.
2. The Satnami rebellion was a religious movement that challenged caste distinctions and involved both Hindus and Muslims.
3. The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were primarily tribal in character, fueled by sentiments of regional autonomy and resistance to Mughal rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each statement accurately reflects a different uprising during Aurangzeb's reign, highlighting the diverse factors that contributed to these rebellions.  The Jat uprisings, rooted in agrarian grievances, involved conflicts over land revenue and zamindari rights, reflecting the socio-economic tensions of the time. The Satnami rebellion, characterized by its inclusive religious ideology, challenged traditional caste hierarchies and brought together people from different religious backgrounds.  The Afghan uprisings, largely tribal in nature, were fueled by both economic grievances and the desire for greater regional autonomy, demonstrating the complexities of resistance against the Mughal empire.


**10. With reference to the literary and artistic developments of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sanskrit continued to be a prominent language for scholarly works in philosophy, literature, and law, with significant contributions from both Hindu and Jain scholars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the literary and artistic landscape of medieval India. Sanskrit remained a dominant language for scholarly and religious works, demonstrating its continued importance despite the rise of other languages. Persian, introduced by the Turkic rulers, became the language of administration and a significant literary language, facilitating cultural exchange.  Regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi also saw a remarkable growth in literary production, reflecting the changing social and religious dynamics of the era.  This diversity of languages and literary traditions is a key feature of the cultural landscape of medieval India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on aspects of Chola architecture, temple economy, and South Indian literature and culture during the period 800-1200 CE.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed knowledge.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style, prevalent during the Chola period, primarily featured single-storied structures with a focus on a spacious, open mandap.
2.  The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, also known as the Rajaraja Temple, is a prime example of the Dravida style, characterized by multiple storeys above the garbhagriha.
3. Gopurams, the lofty gates of Chola temples, became increasingly elaborate over time, contributing to the temple's evolution into a miniature city.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dravida style, characteristic of Chola architecture, was notable for its multi-storied vimanas (towers) rising above the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), not single-storied structures. The mandap, while important, was not the sole focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, exemplifies the Dravida style's characteristic features, including the multiple-storied vimana. Its association with Rajaraja I is also historically accurate, as Cholas often included royal imagery within temple complexes.

Statement 3 is correct. The gopurams, the monumental gateways to Chola temples, progressively grew larger and more ornate over time, reflecting the increasing wealth and power of the temples and their patrons.  This contributed to the temples' transformation into complex, self-sufficient entities resembling small cities.


**2. With reference to the economic aspects of Chola temples (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1. Chola temples primarily relied on royal patronage and lacked significant independent economic activities.
2. Temple lands were often granted revenue-free status, enabling them to accumulate wealth through agricultural surplus.
3. Some wealthy Chola temples engaged in business ventures, such as lending money and participating in trade, significantly augmenting their resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While royal patronage was undoubtedly important, Chola temples were not solely dependent on it.  They actively participated in the economy, accumulating wealth through various means.

Statement 2 is correct.  Temples frequently received grants of land exempt from tax obligations, allowing them to generate substantial income from agricultural production. This revenue-free status was a crucial element in their economic independence and growth.

Statement 3 is correct.  The economic influence of some Chola temples extended beyond land ownership.  Historical evidence suggests their involvement in trade, moneylending, and other business activities, which significantly enhanced their financial resources and influence.  This participation in the broader economy further solidified their position as significant players in Chola society.


**3. With reference to South Indian literature and culture (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Alvars and Nayanmars, popular saints devoted to Vishnu and Shiva respectively, primarily composed their works in Sanskrit, reflecting the dominance of the language in religious discourse.
2. Kamban's Ramayana, a classic of Tamil literature, is attributed to a period significantly later than the Chola empire's peak.
3. The growth of literature in regional languages like Tamil and Kannada during this period was partly facilitated by the decline in Sanskrit's prestige and the increasing popularity of Bhakti movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alvars and Nayanmars, pivotal figures of the Bhakti movement, composed their devotional works predominantly in Tamil, the vernacular language accessible to a wider population, not Sanskrit.  Sanskrit remained important for scholarly and courtly circles but did not dominate religious expression among the masses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kamban's Ramayana, a landmark achievement in Tamil literature, is generally placed within the timeframe of the Chola empire's flourishing, not significantly later.  The text suggests a connection between Kamban and the Chola court.

Statement 3 is correct.  The rise of regional languages in South India during this era can be attributed to several factors, including a relative decline in Sanskrit's dominance and the Bhakti movement's emphasis on vernacular languages to reach broader audiences. The Bhakti saints' use of Tamil and Kannada in their compositions played a crucial role in the development and popularization of these languages as literary vehicles.  This shift reflects a broader cultural transformation towards greater regional identity and expression.


**4. With reference to the Chola capital, Gangaikondacholapuram, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gangaikondacholapuram, a significant urban center during the Chola period, boasts numerous well-preserved palaces showcasing the era's architectural grandeur.
2.  Literary sources of the period offer detailed descriptions of the opulent palaces of Chola rulers and wealthy merchants residing in Gangaikondacholapuram.
3.  The present-day Gangaikondacholapuram is a thriving metropolis, reflecting its continued importance as a major urban hub.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that none of the palaces from the Chola period have survived.  Gangaikondacholapuram's present state is a stark contrast to its former glory.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the physical structures are gone, the text highlights that literary accounts from the Chola period provide vivid descriptions of the magnificent palaces and residences of the elite. These descriptions offer valuable insights into the urban landscape and lifestyle of the era.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that Gangaikondacholapuram is now a small village near Thanjavur, indicating a significant decline from its former status as a major capital city. This transformation underscores the passage of time and the changes in urban dynamics over centuries.
